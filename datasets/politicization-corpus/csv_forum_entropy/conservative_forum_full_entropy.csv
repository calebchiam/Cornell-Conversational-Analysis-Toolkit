It's not easy to counter because most people are going to form an opinion within 15 seconds or less--that's how our society is now. You can thank technology and the constant compression of information into sensational headlines and slogans. I think the Trump supporters have figured out that you do not win that demographic with long, carefully thought out replies. I at least partially blame us as a society in general for reducing politics to this level, but I support Trump's intentions far more than Hillary as it stands. 

The_Donald, for the first time in recent history, has made conservatism appealing to a wider audience of people, particularly younger people who are hip to internet culture. They've formed a culture and an identity that previously was allowed to be qualified by people who hate conservatives, i.e. a bunch of ignorant religious rednecks. And that's not a fair assessment.

That said, Milo was tweeting so he could not qualify his message thoroughly, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt on it.

64,2052,ccbyuf7,DevonWeeks,Conservative,Washington Navy Yard shooting,1379667378,"Let's break that down...

You want to make it tougher (how?) for crazy people (how do you know who that is?) to buy 20 ar-15s (why ar-15s, specifically?) at a gun show (what happens at a gun show that doesn't happen in a store?).

So, make it tougher?  How?  What specific rule will make it tougher?

Tougher for crazy people?  What you really mean is make it tougher for normal people because no regulation you ever see in Congress is ever aimed at just crazy people.  It's aimed at normal people and pushed under the false promise that it will somehow curtail crazy people.

But AR-15s?  Why that gun?  It's not a military-grade weapon.  If you thought so, you'd be thinking of M-16s.  They aren't the same.  An AR-15 is a semi-automatic rifle that is no more functionally different than many hunting rifles.  It has certain things going for it that people like such as weight, ergonomics, modularity, etc.  But, functionally, it's really not any different than a semi-automatic hunting rifle.  Look at the BAR against the FNAR.  The BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle) is an old wooden stock rifle.  I'll provide a link with some pictures.

http://www.icollector.com/Two-Browning-BAR-Semi-Automatic-Rifles_i13749291

The FNAR is a newer semi-automatic rifle that many people erroneously call an ""assault rifle"".  Here's an example of one.

http://www.tactical-life.com/guns-and-weapons/fn-fnar-308/

What makes one more dangerous than the other?  You want to know the answer?  Nothing.  They are the exact same rifle.  I mean that.  Exactly the same.  The BAR designed is produced by FN Herstal, and the FNAR is the same mechanical design of the BAR but in a different looking stock with some accessory rails for a tripod and scope.  That's it.  There is no other difference in these two rifles.  Why would anyone think that by making it tougher to buy an FNAR that the public was any safer?  Yet, the same argument is made about the AR-15.  There is practically no difference in the AR-15 and a number of other guns that simply look less ""militarized"".  What, specifically, about the AR-15 is it you want stopped?

Gun shows?  What do you think is going to happen at a gun show that doesn't happen at a store?  Stores run background checks.  Gun shows run background checks.  The only way to buy a gun without undergoing a background check is to buy it from someone in a private sale.  Most of those, the vast, vast majority, do not happen at gun shows.  They just don't.  At gun shows, vendors (FFL dealers) rent booth space.  These FFLs are required by law to do a background check on all purchases of firearms, and they do.  But, those background checks do not tell them if the customer just got out of the asylum or a suicide clinic.  That information is information liberals don't want shared under the priniciple of patient privacy.  Now, understand, I'm not knocking the patient privacy argument.  I think it's a fair point.  But, you have to ask yourself whether the process of buying a gun has enough gravity to warrant the FFL dealer knowing whether or not someone is mentally ill.  That's a debate I'm not decided on.

The only way to meaningfully address those incidents is to address mental health disclosure and interstate information sharing.

So, do you see why a gun rights advocate looks at your statement and sees nothing meritous?  Gun rights advocates are familiar with the regulations, very familiar.  They have mostly all gone to gun shows and purchased guns at them or at other FFLs.  They understand how statements like yours misrepresent the reality of gun laws, whether you intended to or not.  They listen to the news falsely report about gun crimes calling semi-automatic rifles ""automatic"" or ""military"" rifles.

71,2058,ccc26ib,skyanvil,Conservative,Washington Navy Yard shooting,1379687507,"it depends on what you mean by ""impoverished"".  Impoverishment in China is quite different from impoverishment in UK.

For one, while there are a lot of poor people in China, they tend to be concentrated in remote regions with sparse populations.  But the cost of living in the remote regions are also quite low.  Thus, even the poor in China tend to have sufficient income for living.

Yes, Chinese income gap is quite high nationally, but again, regional income gap may actually NOT be that high.  So, Chinese provinces with a lot of poor people don't have many rich people, and rich Chinese provinces and cities (near the east coast) don't have that many poor people.

The Chinese poor provinces also tend to be very rural and very communal, giving community support to their poor citizens, which cuts down social stresses associated with poverty.

Thus, I think there is less incentive for violent crimes among Chinese poor.

Second, Chinese penal system is quite harsh, which historically is a significant deterrent against violent crimes.

Petty economic crimes are sometimes tolerated in China, unofficially, or dealt with informally without resorting to overly severe judicial procedures.  Chinese citizens are more likely to settle non-violent private disputes without going to courts.  This is a kind of steam valve mechanism, which does not burden the state, as petty criminals are not stigmatized by prosecution in a criminal system, which may lead to repeat offenders for more severe and more violent crimes (such as in UK and US).

The shooter led the attack with a canister of tear gas, the attack happened during a shooting scene, and the theater was packed - anyone with a gun IN the theater who wanted to shoot the attacker would:

A) Have to ignore stinging tear gas
B) Know where the shooter was
C) Get his gun out without drawing extra attention and getting shot
D) Not shoot anyone else in the theater, again while getting gassed
E) After shooting the one guy and actually stopping a guy in body armor, convince everyone else that they weren't part of it all.

The odds that someone could stop the shooter in a dark, smoke filled theater is pretty low, but the odds of them adding to the death toll is much higher, be it through adding to the confusion, to misfired shots. I hate that I can't find it, but there was a video story not long ago about people being given minimal training in firearms and concealed-carry methods.

They were then put into a mock shooting situation to see how effective they were; the end result was that no one could react in time, catching their gun on their clothes or standing up in the middle of a firefight and trying to pull it out.

Here's my opinion on the matter (I'm a Brit by the way). It largely depends on the country. In the USA, gun control ideas are laughable. You are absolutely saturated with guns. Gun control in the USA is like swimming in a pool and opening an umbrella so you don't get wet. It's pointless and is just going to hurt innocent people, criminalise hobbyists, decrease freedoms, and make shootings and robberies easier for criminals.

But like I said, it depends on the country. Gun control arguments in countries with virtually no guns/gun culture at all, such as where I currently live (England), have much stronger grounding - they are already dry, and propose opening the umbrella in the rain.

Ron Paul wants no government involvement in healthcare; Obama wants a LOT. Ron Paul wants constitutionally limited government; Obama wants big government. Ron Paul wants to end the fed; Obama supports the Fed. Ron Paul wants to eliminate all income taxes and the death tax; Obama wants to raise income taxes and the death tax. Ron Paul is supportive of the Citizens United ruling and believes it expands free speech; Obama is against that ruling. What are these people talking about? Maybe they have vaguely similar proposals about gay marriage? These people are insane. Mitt Romney is much, much closer to Ron Paul's positions than Barack Obama. At least with Mitt Romney we'll get to keep more of our money and will have more economic freedom. I like Ron Paul for many reasons but I truly detest Barack Obama's policies and am quite supportive of Mitt Romney overall.

That wouldn't really make much of a difference. Apache beats M16 most any day, and even if you had your very own Apache you couldn't melt down your dead son's toy soldiers to make more Hellfire missiles for it.

&gt;Libya was provided as a more recent example of guns being used as an effective defense against government tyrrany and in no way was I trying to compare Libya's current army against the U.S.'s current army. 

Except the Libyan rebels were fighting the Libyan Army, which isn't that much more advanced than the Libyan rebels themselves. There's a far greater gulf between the abilities of the American Army and the abilities of any realistic group of American ""rebels."" And sure, some elements of the American Army could concievably go over to the ""rebels,"" but then they'd shortly find themselves in the abovementioned position of trying to melt down toy soldiers to replace Hellfires.

Your guns aren't going to do much to stop ""tyranny,"" outside of feverish Walter Mitty fantasy.

Edit: And just to be clear, before any strawmen get built, I'm not against personal ownership of guns. I'm not even particularly against personal ownership of assault rifles.

It's a tax conversation though, and income from salary is pretty fundamentally different than business profit. If an athlete doesn't set up their own clothing line or reinvest their money in some way, they're probably going to pay around 40% on the majority of their money.

Outside of S corporations (I think) business taxes and finances are handled completely differently, so I wouldn't say that they're just held to a different standard, I'd say they're treated as different animals entirely.

&gt;I'm not actually talking about the actual effects, I'm wondering about what would happen if Obama had said ""That athletes aren't successful because of their own talent"". I wonder if Lebron and Chris Paul would still support him then...

If they interpreted it as a personal slight they might not support him, but who's to say if they would still support him? They might have other issues they're more concerned about, or they might attribute a lot of their success to a scholarship or coach or teacher, or who knows what else.", gt I believe that this guy was saying that small businesses  businesses in general are held to a different standard  It s a tax conversation though  and income from salary is pretty,10.0,PineNeedlez 10,gtIbelievethatthisguywassayingthatsmallbusinessesbusinessesingeneralareheldtoadifferentstandardItsataxconversationthoughandincomefromsalaryispretty,1759.036,2497.85

When you are handling a weapon powerful enough to take the lives of dozens of people within minutes you should not be ignorant of your responsibility to know what the heck you are doing and the consequences of intentional or unintentional misuse of the powerful weaponry in your possession.

I don’t think guns should be readily available to just any schmuck with a PayPal account and a mailing address, and I don’t think they should be outlawed altogether. The most unfortunate truth of the situation is that people who want to kill other people will always find a way to do that. Why should we make it any easier for them by just selling the weapons to anyone who wants them? At least if a people killer has to buy a weapon illegally there’s a chance they won’t find one or the person will get busted trying to get one on the streets. 

On the other hand I don’t think guns should be outlawed for people who are going to use them responsibly and not harm others. I’m not sure there is a way to 100% tell who is and who is not going to shoot up a bunch of civilians, but we have to at least be responsible about who is getting access to these dangerous weapons legally.

This is indeed the argument that I would make.  I _suppose_ a conservative response would 'Well, then work at a company that isn't religiously opposed to you'.  But then I wonder, is that any fairer than government intervention. Or possibly, could the response be 'then don't employ anyone who doesn't agree with your religion. If it matters that much to you, you have to give up employing only those who are the most talented or qualified, you have to restrict yourself to people you know won't make you feel like you're sinning.'

Deeper into the article is:
&gt;The Justice Department further argued that people owning for-profit secular businesses do not have a First Amendment right to the free exercise religion in the way they conduct their businesses—particularly if their business is incorporated.

&gt;“Here, plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that the preventive services coverage regulations substantially burden their religious exercise,” the Justice Department told the court. “Hercules Industries, Inc., is not a religious employer; it is ‘an HVAC manufacturer.'”

&gt;“The First Amendment Complaint does not allege that the company is affiliated with a formally religious entity such as a church,” the Justice Department told the federal court. “Nor does it allege that the company employs persons of a particular faith. In short, Hercules Industries is plainly a for-profit, secular employer.”

&gt;“By definition,” the Justice Department claimed, “a secular employer does not engage in any ‘exercise of religion.’”

I think the 'particularly if their business is incorporated' is interesting, at least.  You do get a lot of benefits for incorporating.  And I _don't_ want to derail this into some OWS corporate personhood thing, but if the company is its own separate, legal entity, and if the owners get a lot of benefits and protections for incorporating, isn't it reasonable to expect them to play by more secular rules?

However, it must be posted on the door in clear sight for everyone to see if the state allows civilians to carry firearms.  I *hope* that this article would have mentioned that, because that would be suitable evidence to arrest this guy.  Otherwise, he's completely innocent and is a law abiding citizen.

If the theater does have rules against weapons, and he took the gun in there anyway, then yes he's at fault.  If the article knowingly failed to mention that, then it's just a media attempt to make guns seem ""bad"" to persuade the readers.  i.e., it makes it look like he was arrested for having a gun, not for breaking a law that is clearly stated when one earns a weapons permit.

We have to consider many things when taking these statistics, including culture, socio-economic status, police efficacy (which is often tied to socio-economic status), geography, and existing public policy (including tax rates, health and safety programs, etc). The Germans are very different from Americans in most of these regards. They have a very different culture, their police are sometimes very effective, they are a relatively densely population country and quite evenly distributed, and their socio-economic status is different in several regards. 

America on the other hand is inadvertently structured to have more crime. Our cities are densely populated with urban poor, the outskirts of these cities are very wealthy and moderately populated so the police are unevenly distributed. Tax rates versus services received are uneven. We also have a rather unequal society.

That's not to say that that money can't do a lot of good in other places as well- but 40 million for cleanup, repairs and all the associated costs of that at 8 military bases across several states, well that's not all that hard to imagine. 

Now, if they were to set up an account and charge it as the costs came in, they could probably get it done for less if they really tried. But that's not how the government works, at least for the most part, and here's why: There are two primary ways to find projects like this. You can set up an open-line account they way I just described, or you can provide a fixed budget. To make a simple analogy, say you give someone a list of items you need them to buy that you estimate should cost around $90. You can give them a hundred dollar bill or you can give them a credit card. If you give them a hundred dollar bill, they're going to keep the whole thing. But if you give them a credit card, they won't be forced stay within the provided amount and they may end up spending $150 on what they could have gotten for a lot less if they had tried a little harder. Contractors (clean up crews, construction companies) are typically going to push for open-line accounts because it allows them more freedom and to make higher profits, while customers usually prefer fixed budgets so they know from the start how much the project is going to cost.

So the government chooses to provide a fixed budget - they estimate how much the project is going to cost, make a budget for it, and find a contractor who's willing to work within that budget.

Glorification of ""misunderstood"" mass murderers may serve to attract the morbidly curious and boost ratings, but it also incentivizes such tragedies by giving powerless cretins an avenue for expression. If the media were really concerned about helping to fix the problem, they would publicly humiliate the killers as much as possible- at a bare minimum, they'd focus exclusively on the victims. 

Ironically, the ineptitude of the media in this case might have inadvertently accomplished some of this. So many missteps have been taken about the killer, from posting a picture of the wrong Ryan to not having the right name in the first place, that news outlets are starting to backpedal from stories about the killer... at least for the time being. I've grown too cynical to hope it will keep up, but it's a start. I'd consider it an obligation for us to publicly condemn romanitcized spins about depraved sickos in the interest of destroying one of their key incentives to commit these acts in the first place. It won't fix the problem, but it'd be a big first step.",In the fifth and final season of the cable series  The Wire   most of the major problems plaguing the inner city of Baltimore are not attributed only to inept politicians ,3.0,[deleted] 3,InthefifthandfinalseasonofthecableseriesTheWiremostofthemajorproblemsplaguingtheinnercityofBaltimorearenotattributedonlytoineptpoliticians,1188.996,1648.233

An armed society is a safer society. Background checks and psychological evaluations of school administrators and teachers. If they are seen fit to carry a firearm, provide them with the means of taking a CCW course and allowing them to carry concealed on school property.

Why? Most of these mass shootings happen in gun free zones, the shooter knows there'll be little to no resistance until the police arrive. If we arm individuals we will be able to prevent psychologically unstable people from bringing harm upon those who are not armed because of the chance of resistance from people defending themselves and students.

Banning a gun because it's black is 100% not the way to prevent this from happening again. Not only was the shooter 20, which is under the CT law of 21 for possessing a handgun, he also took the handgun to a school which has anti-gun laws already in place. Criminals hell bent on causing harm to others will not mind the laws. If weapons are banned and good intentions are continued to be used to guard our children and livelihood, then only the criminals will be using firearms.

We were so shocked by the only massacre we've had, that we did this. It's the ""cherry on top"" of a society that never really had this as a serious problem. It obviously won't work in the USA. 

My assessment of your situation over remains that school architecture is the problem, not the guns. I'm always shocked when watching US media or reading stories based in the USA by just how much children (and teachers) seem to hate their schools as massive institutions. We think of our schools as mini-universities which makes that sort of sentiment seem a very foreign sort of thing. Our schools breed independence, an open self-organising society and self-reliance backed by social support and open-minded teachers. Students and teachers work together to understand the world, rather than having teachers impose rigid order on students. Even on a very human level - between each classroom are inspiring grounds, not depressing windowless coridoors. It's much healthier for an egalitarian democracy.

US schools seem to create people who are ether accepted or rejected by 'the system'. The rejected ones seem to lash out in various ways (crime, violence, drug abuse, welfare dependency, etc), but the whole idea of 'the system' is just unnecessarily divisive result of those ridiculous and inexplicably confronting institutions that strike me as remarkably undemocratic. 

Whenever I think of US schools, I think of 1888, the christian nationalist-socialist Francis Bellamy salute and the nationalist-socialist rooted ""pledge of allegiance"". They're pre-technology, pre-library war indoctrination camps. Remnants of a top-down, tyranny-ridden time in your nation's history - propelled by nothing more than nostalgia for youth and a ""kids should suffer what I suffered"" mentality, and not by any sort of serious intellectual underpinning. Tyranny breeds rebellion. It's not a good foundation for a democracy - and a good explanation of why your democracy lacks open civility and trust, and often looks exactly like a non-violent civil war.",No worries  Gun control makes sense for Australian society  but even we question its effectiveness  We were so shocked by the only massacre we ve had  that we did this  It s,6.0,[deleted] 6,NoworriesGuncontrolmakessenseforAustraliansocietybutevenwequestionitseffectivenessWeweresoshockedbytheonlymassacrewevehadthatwedidthisIts,2162.741,4749.799

Modern schools are a friendly  collection of house-like 'clusters', filled with ground-level classrooms, and connected and surrounded by parks. The monolithic school is an old-fashioned device uniquely designed to create either conformity or conflict with 'the establishment', rather than to create independent free-thinking students. The rest of the world stopped building these some time ago, and is now building mini-universities. The design of the US school is of a nineteenth century soldier factory, not a place of learning.

That being said, I write this modest proposal not as a knee jerk reaction to the Newton school shooting, but in response to the horrifying spree killings that have afflicted our country over the past several years. Liberals love to ban, control things and divorce them from human agency. Conservatives have a far realistic perspective on the human condition that is based on individuality and individual responsibility. A free society, is a paramount virtue of conservative ideology, and must remain so despite the hysterical reactions of liberals to ""do something"". All this being said, it is time that conservatives look at what we can do to lessen the probability of something like Aurora, Columbine or Newtown from happening again. Liberals will begin by proposing a ban on assault riffles. This is exactly the kind of knee-jerk and ultimately futile legislation that only limits the freedom of law-abiding individuals. 

What can conservatives propose to counter such shallow initiatives? The gun control debate is a complete farce. Guns do not kill people on their own. We already have legislation that makes automatic weapons highly regulated. Limiting magazine size might help slightly, but the large supply of higher capacity magazines already in the market make any such ban largely irrelevant. Secondly, liberals constantly see gun owners as the enemy of gun control. Which is of course true. But that is because many liberals fantasize about a world without guns, or at least a citizenry that is completely unarmed, we do not live in such a world and conservatives would deal with the world we have, and would never want to give the government complete agency over self-defense. If we want to prevent mass killings we must look at the root cause. Yes, guns are the weapon of choice, but McVie, killed many people with gasoline and fertilizer. We are not about to ban gas and fertilizer. The response to the Oklahoma bombings was both regulating the sale (through markers in fertilizer) and more controlled distribution. Both of these things happened with the help of farmers, producers and distributors. Liberal anti-gun advocates, would rather make war on the entire gun industry and its consumer rather than find solutions to the actual problem. Gun bans are easy, just a stroke of a pen and instantly law abiding peaceful individuals are now criminals. No, we must not let that happen. But we must stand up for something that makes sense and uses our current community resources to stem the tide.  

We are a country that has a gun for every man woman and child that lives within our borders. And I think that is on balance a good thing. The second amendment as passed by the states reads: ""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" Clearly the right to bear arms is couched in terms of national security, but foreign and domestic. The well regulated militia part has always fascinated me and it implies that the citizens of the United States have almost an obligation to serve in its defense. Also, it implies that gun ownership is not a trifle and nessessitates community organization, training and oversight.

The shooting that we have endured over the past several years have not been the acts of individuals of sound mind, these have all been men in their early 20s (which happens to be about when schizophrenia manifests itself). So for me the answer is a community based licensure scheme, whereby local gun clubs regulate the licensing of gun ownership. Once you have a license you should be able to take your gun where ever you want but, to get a license you have to be trained by someone/group in your community. First it would be long guns at 18 and then hand guns at 21. The NRA should be interested in such as scheme as it would undoubted increase their revenue as well as foster and ever stronger community identity within the gun ownership community.

As you've already pointed out, a shooter typically has ten or fifteen minutes from when the shooting starts to when the police arrive and confront them. Those numbers reflect that. In the situation we are comparing, however, the police are hypothetically already on the scene, so the ten or fifteen minute delay would not apply.

The other improves the existing situation (police with guns) and has many other benefits besides prevention of school shootings, such as potentially preventing innocent bystanders from being shot in the event you cited above.

524,278,c7jbjr9,leanstartup,Republican,Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting,1355960443,"I have a different opinion, although I agree with your description of the illegal drug market. I think some prohibitions are doomed to failure; food is an extreme example. I also think certain prohibitions can succeed, or that they can at least achieve some productive goals. I think some prohibitions are unethical while others are ethical. I would say I try to examine issues separately without a black &amp; white approach.

In the case of gun control, I believe a prohibition would have several positive and negative results, and there may even be a short-term increase in corresponding death statistics. Overall, I believe that serious gun control would achieve a long-term net reduction in related destruction/deaths that is not replaced by equivalent substitutes.

One major reason I hold this belief is that impulse acts, suicide and accidents account for a large portion of gun destruction/deaths, and gun prohibition might have a large long-term effect on these statistics even if it does not have this effect on homicide or mass murder statistics. The illegal/black market status of guns would change ownership behavior and patterns even if a black market was robust.

Further, I believe the black market for guns would be fundamentally different than the drug market. The consumer base and buying patterns would be completely different. The products are fundamentally different. I don't want to use a strawman argument by suggesting you don't believe any prohibition can work. You must believe a slightly different version of what I believe, but we end up on opposite sides. I think guns are one of the products where a prohibition can achieve productive results.

I believe the 2nd amendment is violated by most gun control legislation. I think democrats should focus on a long-term campaign to initiate a constitutional convention so that we can have a new, more appropriate amendment. I don't know why liberals insist on unconstitutional slapdash gun control laws that aren't effective from any perspective.

As for global warming, as a geography and gis major I'll respectfully disagree. Global Warming is no myth, incoming short wave solar radiation comes in, some absorbed into the ground the rest reflected based on albedo as long wave radiation. The global warming part occurs when the long wave radiation is reflected back down to earth because of GHG's and other pollutants and other non volatile things. This is a fact and not debated by anyone. I think the argument is now the actual RATE at which the globe is warming.

An assault rifle is significantly more accurate than a handgun and can hold many more rounds.  Additionally, the higher power grants longer range and the ability for the round to continue erratically, possibly wounding more.

The downside of assault weapons is the longer weapon can be grabbed and controlled easier in close combat.  It's also heavier and harder to conceal.

Second, you basically said exactly what I stated was one of the only reasonable defenses of guns - that the right itself is simply worth the loss of life we, as a society, may suffer for it.

However, I still stand by my criticism of your original post. You said:

&gt;This shows that the gun control laws on the books didn't stop Duke from acquiring a weapon illegally. 

Right, but just about every law gets broken every day.

&gt;This lowers his incentive to commit the crime and therefore leads to some would be criminals deciding it isn't worth it.

I think that's a broad statement that is generally true, but certainly not always true. Most of these shooting sprees end with the attacker taking their own life. Either they aren't thinking rationally in the first place, or they are suicidal. You constantly cite these shooting sprees, and I really think those are the worst examples of people who are likely to be deterred by armed resistance. 

I think it's more common crime like muggings, robberies, etc. that are committed by people who would be deterred by concealed firearms. However, not every violent crime is a homicide, and I would think that more crimes would be murders or attempted murders if the assailant suspects you are armed. A mugger who is afraid to turn his back on you and run away once he has your wallet or purse might not be content to leave you unharmed. 

Anyway, I'm not a gun control proponent, and I do think the ability to defend ourselves from the government is important (though I think the best defense against a government run amok is soldiers who are better connected to their communities and more likely to desert or joint the rebellion if they were ordered to turn against civilians).

My point is just that you cite all these scenarios in which guns are necessary for defense, and the counter-argument is that guns are necessary to defend against other guns. It's a vicious cycle that would only be broken by a mass confiscation of guns that I don't think ever could, should, or would happen, at least not in my lifetime, though I suppose if it were going to happen, it probably start with something subtle.

One last thing:

&gt;In fact just last week a man in China slashed 22 kids at a school with a knife.

* Obviously, it should be optional for the teachers.  No one should be *forced* to carry a gun.

* Gun security needs to be addressed in some manner, and it needs to be virtually infallible.  At a middle/high school level, you have to consider that in many cases the students and bigger and stronger than the teacher.  You don't want students to be able to take guns from the teachers.  At the elementary school level, you can't ""accidentally"" leave a gun laying around.  There have been stories of Cops (and similar) leaving their guns in a bathroom or something like that; you can't have that happen in an elementary school.  It only takes one kid to shoot themselves with a teacher's gun and suddenly there are no more ""Guardian Plans"" around.

* There are a lot of teachers in the United States.  There are probably more than a handful that are mentally unstable.  There needs to be something in place to identify those people and make sure that they don't turn into the psycho shooting up the school.

* The training and the ""rules of engagement"" would have to be excessive.  You don't want a teacher pulling their gun out every time they feel ""threatened"" by a student, or every time two guys get into a fist fight in the cafeteria.  The guns are there to prevent Sandy Hook, and that's the only time they should be used.

* We have to remember that all schools are different.  I think a lot of us in ""white suburbia"" tend to picture our schools when ideas like this are thrown out.

There were [11,493 Assault (homicide) by discharge of firearms in 2009](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr60/nvsr60_03.pdf).  I had heard that ""assault weapon"" homicides account for approximately 1% to 3% of all firearm homicides.  Trying to substantiate that claim, I came across [this](http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcassaul.html), [this](http://www.guncite.com/journals/rational.html), and [this](http://www.bradycenter.org/xshare/pdf/reports/mass-produced-mayhem.pdf).  This puts the number of Assault (homicide) by discharge of firearms (assault weapon), at approximately 40 to 345 in 2009.

The question becomes, how many of those deaths were preventable?  Under speculation, let us assume that an assault weapon makes you 50% more efficient, such that half of those people would have lived.  The other half would have been assaulted by other means.  This means there were approximately 20 to 173 Assault (homicide) by discharge of firearms (assault weapon) that were preventable.

The statistics, from my own limited research, is sound.  The speculation is just a [WAG](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wild+ass+guess), but is intended to show that the number ""saved"" is fairly trivial (not to say any one of those lives were trivial, but the number is so small against the all assaults or the total number of deaths to fall well within the margin of error of any study).  Don B. Kates and Gary Mauser, who wrote [WOULD BANNING FIREARMS REDUCE MURDER AND SUICIDE? A REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AND SOME DOMESTIC EVIDENCE](http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol30_No2_KatesMauseronline.pdf) and published in the Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy Volume 30 Number 2, conclude that ""the burden of proof rests on the proponents of the more guns equal more death and fewer guns equal less death.""  They continue, ""To bear that burden would at the very least require showing that a large number of nations with more guns have more death and that nations that have imposed stringent gun controls have achieved substantial reductions in criminal violence (or suicide). **But those correlations are not observed** when a large number of nations are compared across the world."" (emphasis mine).

To summarize, those who would want to ban ""assault weapons"" need to prove that the ban would have a reasonable increase in safety.  However, it is all speculation and likely within the margin of error.  I will continue to research this.  My next goal is to research the previous ban years and post ban removal, but a cursory examination from [Homicide Trends In The United States, 1980-2008](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=2221) shows [no correlation to homicides with guns pre or post ban](http://i.imgur.com/5t54Z.png).

The whole point was to arm the citizenry in such case that the government became tyrannical. Or in case of an invasion, to provide for a wide spread defense. At the time the government was armed with muskets and long rifles, so that's what the citizens were armed with. 

In order to preserve the original intent of the amendment, it is necessary for people to be armed with military grade weapons. How else can we defend against a multi-billion dollar military and police state?

There has been a complete suspension of reason and logic in gun-control debate, especially since Sandy Hook. All of the sudden, supporting the right to own a firearm means you advocate the murder of children. 

I also hate the argument that the moment someone carries a gun, they lose all restraint and common sense, and are suddenly likely to engage in an unprovoked shooting spree.

I then researched every single entry on that page.  Here are my findings.

There were a total of 512 deaths (including suicide of the perpetrator) from 1982 until 2012.  Of those, 100 deaths in 10 incidents were ""Assault Weapon"" related.

* [Stockton schoolyard shooting: Stockton, California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_School_massacre)

There were 5 deaths in one incident by ""Assault Weapons"" during the ban.  

Additional interesting statistics:

Highest death counts:

* 33-[Virginia Tech massacre: Blacksburg, Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_massacre), 9mm (Glock 19) handgun, .22 LR (Walther P22) handgun
* 28-[Newtown school shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Newtown_school_shooting), AR-15 (Bushmaster XM-15) rifle, 10mm (Glock 20 SF) handgun, 9mm (SIG Sauer) handgun, shotgun

First, I don't understand why you put semi in parenthesis.  Are you meaning to imply that there's no distinction between a semi-automatic weapon and an automatic weapon?  (That's how it reads to me over the internet.)  Most weapons (handguns, hunting rifles, etc.) are semi-automatic.  Are you suggesting we ban most guns?

Second, you have placed the onus of justification on the wrong party.  It is the gun *control* side which has to justify limiting our 2nd Amendment rights by restricting access to higher capacity magazines (not ""clips"", by the way.  Clips are [totally different](http://www.knewance.com/comparisons/clip-v-magazine.html) from magazines.)  Furthermore, the exact number of rounds that makes a magazine ""high capacity"" is very arbitrary.  30 rounds isn't particularly high, in my opinion, that's just about average.  To some, 10 rounds might seem high.

I never, NEVER, NEVER suggested legalizing those things. Heroin and meth use have very obvious effects on others (ie, violent acts, increased theft, increased healthcare costs, etc...) I'm speaking specifically about gay marriage. Good of you to throw in a red herring, and imply I said something I didn't to rebut something I did say. Perhaps you should work on your reading comprehension. 

Also, I'm not a nihilist. At all. I don't think you understand what nihilism is. Are you college educated? If so, where did you go and what did you study? I'd suggest going back, or asking for a refund. 

All of those things you just said can't be shown to be objectively immoral, are much more obviously immoral. Those comparisons are stupid choices. Pedophilia and gay marriage don't exist in the same arenas. One has a victim, one is two people in love choosing to be with one another. Completley different. 

And public nudity, polygamy, and necrophilia all have negative effects on others, physical or not. I never used the word physically, please stop inserting words into my mouth. 

The ""extreme authority"" argument you posited is a little unclear, I'm not sure what you're driving at. I never suggested marriage wasn't an institution. I did however assert the exact opposite. I posited that marriage is a legal institution, not a religious one and therefore merits that equal treatment under the law be employed.

It is not ""absurd"" to suggest allowing the existence of a behavior encourages it. And to imply it is ""absolutely false"" weakens your argument, few things are ""absolutely"" anything. The difference between gay marriage and murder, as you've tactlessly drawn comparisons between, is that committing murder harms others (obviously) whereas gay marriage has no effect outside of the marriage in itself--you might think it does, but it really doesn't. If we allow gay marriage to happen, we aren't ""responsible for it,"" the individuals getting married are. Churches wouldn't be mandated to give gay marriages, and you aren't forced to attend gay weddings, only the parties involved are efected. Insofar as the public wellbeing isn't threatened, the government has no say in prohibiting behavior. 

And gay marriage in your mind may be equivalent to nihilism, but others are free to disagree, but you shouldn't be allowed to impose that view on others who are entitled equal treatment by the law. Aside from that, gay marriage does not show disrespect to any institution other than maybe your specific religious one. Marriage as a whole is a legal one, that grants certain privaleges unavailable to other couples. Not allowing them to get married is a violation of their civil rights. 

The point I want to make, more succinctly put, is that you are allowed to think gay marriage is immoral. But because gay marriage does not have the added impact of negatively effecting others, and because many other people also feel that it is not immoral, it would be considered legislating morality to disallow it. Insofar as gay marriage cannot be known to be objectively immoral, it should not be made to be illegal. Murder, however, is objectively immoral and should be illegal.

Neither of these are necessarily true. In the case of abortion, the divide is on whether an unborn child has rights. If so, the liberals would have been more against abortion than most pro-life politicians.

In the case of gay marriage, it's possible they'd've said that the government doesn't need to recognize/subsidize marriages at all, but it's unlikely they would have supported expanding the definition to include homosexual couples.

729,2043,ccbw27x,DevonWeeks,Conservative,Washington Navy Yard shooting,1379651541,"The problem is what you would call ""stringent"" restrictions.  I mean, let's look at it subjectively.  Do we require background checks on everyone who purchases a firearm with the exception of private sales?  Check.  Do we have a system in place which imposes harsher penalties on crimes committed with guns?  Check.  Do we have manufacturing regulations determining the type of guns that we will or won't allow?  Check (and, FYI, that system is actually quiet stringent and prevents many guns from being imported into the US, including Glocks which instead must be imported in pieces and assembled at a factory in Georgia, and that's a fairly standard semi-auto pistol).  Do we prohibit ownership of automatic weapons and high explosive weapons?  Check.  I could go on.

I say all of this because I want to make clear a few things.  First, you appear to operate under the assumption that guns are this huge problem in the US.  They aren't.  Gun crime is down, and guns kill only a fraction of the people that alcohol and cigarettes do annually.  The logic for controlling guns, a declining problem (if you even want to call it a problem), is simply inconsistent with the arguments for allowing other things like liquor or cigarettes.  Gun violence continues to drop, yet calls for more and more strict regulations continue.  Liberals can say all they want they aren't out for confiscation or outright prohibition, but how else do you explain a tightening grip on a dying issue?  The arguments for gun control advocates never have any merit.  Hell, the news anchors reporting it don't even know the difference between automatic and semi-automatic rifles and misrepresent the issue all the time.  It's all essentially, ""I think these things are scary and that people shouldn't have them!  So, make a law for it!""

There is simply no reason to prohibit guns.  Prohibitions have never worked.  It always gives rise to a new inudstry, a dangerous, violent industry run by vice lords and back alley thugs.  It creates criminals where none existed, and for what?  So, some folks could feel fuzzy?  Why do liberal arguments only go as far as the gun and never try to look at today's culture?  Why not mental illness, an over-medicated population, and pharmaceuticals?  Why do they adamantly oppose you ever look at the implications of their behavior, of their vices, of their poor decisions?  

I mean, let's face it.  We have a pretty poor culture these days.  But, it's not because of the 2nd Amendment.  Why is it that all the things that could potentially address the underlying causes of violence in general are things liberals won't even discuss or will even outright refuse to advocate?  What does that say about the kind of society they want?  You can't have your cake and eat it to.  You can't claim to want people to be safer while promoting a society of degenerates, and that's exactly what our culture promotes.  

Gun violence is not a problem.  Violence is.  Guns are one of many tools of the trade, and violence is only a symptom of a societal disease.  Nonone can have an honest discussion about the root causes of crime or violent behavior because any honest analysis has been branded as something undesirable.  Wanting to create a system where being forcibly committed for psychiatric treatment is included in your background check gets you branded as a violator of people's privacy.  Speaking out against offensive and violent language of certain music industries gets you branded as intolerant, racist, sexist, or any number of other things.  Wanting to promote a traditional family with two parents in a stable home will get you chewed out for being insensitive or worse.  Seriously, what else can you do?  You can't stop promoting anger in pop media.  You can't advocate for a more stable economic and family situation for a child during their upbringing.  You can't let anyone know that the person trying to buy a gun is an unmedicated schitzophrenic who was recently committed for suicidal thoughts.  How can one possibly expect to ever see anything get better?  Do you really think that outlawing a sporting rifle is going to change the problem of violence?  

Just recently, a man died from being punched in the head by some loon who vowed to punch the next white person he saw.  Now, how will you address it?  Seriously.  Why does nothing about that incident provoke from you the same type of response as the false reports of an AR-15 being used in gun crime?  Why aren't you suddenly screaming for mental health reforms, hate crime enforcement, or anything else?  You see, all of this indicates what I said earlier.  That gun control advocates are just afraid of guns, period, because when it comes time to fix any other type of violence, they're mute.

5. Follow a mandatory restricted firearm safety course.

9. Purchase your AR.
10. Register your AR to the nationnal weapon registry.
11. Submit a demand for a temporary autorisation to transport (ATT) to your provincial chief firearm officer.
12. Wait for the ATF to show up in your mailbox.
13. Pickup your AR and bring it to your home.

Now want to use your shiny new AR?

1. Submit a demand for a ""permanent"" autorisation to transport (ATT) to your provincial chief firearm officer.
2. Wait for the ATF to show up in your mailbox.
3. Bring your shiny new AR to an approved firing range WHICH must be an approved location on your ATT (Sorry, can't use your restricted firearm on your property).

Also live in Québec?

1. Apply for a one year membership at an approved shooting club.
2. Follow yet another firearm safety course because of Bill 9.
3. Undergo a background check by the police.
4. Receive your approval by the police to use you AR.
5. Renew your membership every year or be repported to the police.

Long story short is the ATF had a program intended to not just catch people making straw purchases but also the people that were the final recipients of the weapons. The ATF would track the weapons, arrest the people trying to receive the weapons, and curb some of the illegal gun running from the US into Mexico. For whatever reason, and there's some contention on where the breakdown occurred, the ATF let the weapons slip too far out and lost track of them. Some of those weapons have ended up in crime scenes in the US and Mexico. So gun store owners were dutifully reporting suspicious sales, the ATF was monitoring the purchasers up to a point, and then a breakdown occurred and the weapons got beyond the ATFs ability to interdict.

The DOJ conclusion was that the breakdown was primarily because the ATF and US Attorney's Office had an end-game goal of elimintating the trafficing organizations entirely, and that they felt early interdiction would compromise that effort.",Look up Operation Fast and Furious  Long story short is the ATF had a program intended to not just catch people making straw purchases but also the people that were,18.0,rangecard 18,LookupOperationFastandFuriousLongstoryshortistheATFhadaprogramintendedtonotjustcatchpeoplemakingstrawpurchasesbutalsothepeoplethatwere,2460.726,2883.515

I'll do you one better-- actual confiscation: Obama's recent executive order that requires local chief law enforcement officer signoff on trusts that hold NFA firearms (arbitrary barrel length regulation, full auto, suppressors) means that if a person lives in an area where their LEO is anti-gun and refuses to sign the paperwork, when the original owner dies, their firearm cannot be possessed by their heirs; the ATF snatches the firearms out of their hands.  Before Obama's EO a couple weeks ago, an heir could be added to the trust without being subject to the political whims of the local LEO.

Edit: I should add, since the EO hasn't actually taken effect yet, it remains to be seen how it plays out.  It may not *just* affect future heirs to an estate, but may also affect people who previously inherited an NFA firearm that is part of a trust.  So in other words, if your dad passed down a hunting rifle with a 15"" barrel to you back in the '80s as part of the trust, but you didn't get your local LEO sign-off on it (because you didn't need to), you may have that rifle confiscated if your current chief LEO refuses to give his stamp of approval now.

Many people will ask, ""Why is this in /r/conservative? What does this have to do with Conservatism?"" and not all of them will be liberal concern trolls.

There are many reasons this pertains to conservatism.

* First and foremost: we are realists, and we face reality as it is, not reality as filtered through ""how it should be"" and ideology. If something isn't working out, we notice.
* This is an anti-majoritarian act. The conservative standard is not ideology, but paying attention to history and what has succeed and what has not. Majorities reflecting a historical population are the backbone of a nation.
* Conservatism includes the idea of preservation, and this includes the preservation of ethnic groups. If there's open race warfare in our streets, more than one ethnic group is at risk; if there's a shadowy agenda to merge us all into one race, as our media and government support, then we have to question why this ""soft democide"" is being tolerated.
* Conservatism includes the idea of individual moral choice being first and foremost, but doesn't deny that morality is dependent on culture which is in turn a function of ethnicity. Stories like this make us question what we have in common after all, and if there's nothing, make us wonder how long our nation-state will hold together before collapsing from lack of internal cohesion.
* Traditionally, the media has under-reported stories of violence against majorities because such stories go against the media/left's pity-based narrative, in which all who are powerful are evil and all who are marginalized are good. Conservatism views this narrative with extreme skepticism because it is obviously fabricated and does not explain the events of history.
* Finally, we are wary of liberal Soviet-style social engineering. This tends to be based in ideology, or human social thoughts about what ""should"" be, and correspond very little to reality itself.

Before the inevitable only-on-Reddit peanut gallery starts bleating out the repetitive slogans it has learned from its liberal news-entertainment controllers, and the ""useful idiots"" start endorsing various types of foreign ideology or custom, we should look to our conservative heritage of ideas and see where this story fits in -- and how it debunks the dominant paradigm (globalism/diversity) of our time.",   Greenville Shooter Picked Victims by Race   ABC News   September 24  2013  http   abclocal go com wtvd story section news 2Flocal amp id 9260396  Many people will ask   Why is this in  r conservative  What does this have to do with Conservatism   and,19.0,mayonesa 19,GreenvilleShooterPickedVictimsbyRaceABCNewsSeptember242013httpabclocalgocomwtvdstorysectionnews2Flocalampid9260396ManypeoplewillaskWhyisthisinrconservativeWhatdoesthishavetodowithConservatismand,3440.992,3724.527

Of course your old insurance doesn't know who is in your new insurance network.


Anyone upset about the cost of health insurance should be advocating for a single-payer system. If you want to pay less, start making noise about the most cost effective system available.

Literally every problem espoused in this article is easily solved with single payer healthcare. In the UK, health spending by the government is half of what it is in the us, and our MAXIMUM payroll tax is still higher than theirs, as is our maximum income tax.

You can't have it both ways. If you want affordable healthcare and choice of doctors, single payer is the only option.

If you want private insurance where the cost is higher and the options fewer, while costing taxpayers the most money possible, just say so.

1.) Gang shootings do not get coverage because the largest concentration of gang violence in this nation takes place in democratic states or cities with gun control laws. This would prove they do not work, and they don't want to put their foot in their mouth.
2.) By hyping the level of mass shootings it gives it that almost ""terrorist-esque"" fear post 9/11. If people are deathly afraid of being a victim of a mass shooting every time they leave the house they will believe whatever the media feeds them. 

3.) We, and all the logical thinkers, know that the issue behind the mass shootings is mental health. Lets look at the recent D.C shooting, Newtown, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Columbine, even the DC sniper, the reasoning was that each shooter/s had a mental illness. Regardless of how they acquired the firearm they were all mentally ill. But acknowledging that it is not something which can be eliminated with a new law kills the ""progressive"" idealism that dems and libs have of constantly making some type of change which is ""beneficial"".

So the truth is that we know what causes these gun crimes, and eventually without the liberal media constantly pumping bullshit by the gallon down the throats of the left wing dems  and sheep alike people will eventually be able to think for themselves again. However that is not a possibility because these media outlets have the money to maintain the feed and it will not stop because they have perfected the brainwashing.

I'm suggesting that the terror no fly list should go through regular, transparent courts with all involved allowed council and anyone on that list shouldn't be allowed to own a gun.  

The way the terror no fly list is now is ripe for abuse (Bush and Valarie Plame) - make it legal and legit and that should be the beginning negotiation point for gun control.  

We already have gun control in this country.  Every state has their own laws and they're confusing as hell.  I'm an avid hunter and my wife an I own several firearms and we both know everything about using them safely.  We should nationalize the laws while we're at it too.  Concealed carry should be standard in every state and national background checks should be online as well.

I live in Orlando and the way the laws are now I can sell you a gun with no questions asked and it would be completely legal.  Guns are responsible for this massacre the same way planes were responsible for 9/11.  We regulate the hell out of the airlines and no one bats an eye.

Take the narrative about mental illness and access to guns.  On the surface it sounds great to say that psychos shouldn't have access to guns.

But the devil is in the details.

Something like 30% of Americans have been on some sort of medication to treat mental problems.  If you add the number who have seen a shrink or engaged in some other sort of therapy, then it probably doubles at the least.

So, where do we draw the line?  It is pretty simple to find potential cases where someone is depressed or having some psychological related problems but they also require a gun for some reason.  Maybe it is simply the only thing that makes them happy as a hobby, or they hunt and provide a large portion of their families food, or they work in a job that requires them to carry for one reason or another.

So, if you pass some sort of law limiting their right to own and use a gun lawfully under some condition related to them seeking help then they have a reason not to seek help.

If the only thing keeping me sane is shooting off some rounds at the gun range each week, or if my life or the lives of my family are dependent on me having access to guns, and I am also suffering and I know that if I go get help then I lose my access to guns then it is simply better to tough it out.  It will also create a chilling effect between doctors and patients.

Also, there is the whole HIPAA laws.  Also the fact to do something like that would defacto be creating a registry database.

The same is true with pretty much all ""sensible"" gun regulation put forward by the left.

I don't even own any guns and it is obvious to me that this isn't about protecting people but instead destroying the 2nd Amendment.",The problem with so called  sensible  gun control is that it really isn t so sensible when you get into the details  Take the narrative about mental illness and access to,9.0,Mememagicianbob 9,TheproblemwithsocalledsensibleguncontrolisthatitreallyisntsosensiblewhenyougetintothedetailsTakethenarrativeaboutmentalillnessandaccessto,2074.977,2538.884

Hitler came to power in the 1940's, Stalin around the same time, and Mao in the 1960's. This is very recent history.

Our homicide rate decreased 10.5% more than Australia's did, after Australia banned all guns and we continued to 'Merica it up.

Valid point, thank you. 

[Australian homicide rates per 100K](http://www.aic.gov.au/dataTools/facts/vicViolentRate.html)

Meanwhile, the [homicide rate in the US](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0873729.html) has dropped from 7.4:100K to 4.5:100K


You're definitely right to point that out though. Switched to the other source because the original chart has male and female rate separated in the US, which doesn't make any sense to do.


Regardless, the point stands. Australia has had less of a decrease in its homicide rate than the US has had over the last 20 years. The question remains - if one country has a full-on ban on guns and it experiences the exact same homicide rate decrease as a country which allows guns for all of its citizens, how can anyone argue for banning guns to decrease the homicide rate? All it does is reduce the **gun crime** rate, but if someone is set on killing you, they're going to find a way.",Edit  a few hours later  I realized I used figures from two different calculations  Just means the numbers are now in favor of more guns  instead of neutral  Aus homicide,13.0,SO_MUCH_ENERGY 13,EditafewhourslaterIrealizedIusedfiguresfromtwodifferentcalculationsJustmeansthenumbersarenowinfavorofmoregunsinsteadofneutralAushomicide,3653.627,3922.46

As he describes his path to extremism, you can see a lot of parallels to how internalized homophobia works in Christian society. Any gay man who has spent time in the closet bullying other gay kids should be able to relate. The solution to homosexuality is to become more religious, more extreme. The primary difference is that the Muslim world is far more conservative, violent Islamist ideology is mainstream and readily accessible 'solution' for tortured queers, and governments dont necessarily have the protective effect of secularism.

This has been the best Ive seen on MSM so far about internalized homophobia And how mainstream homophobic religious ideology causes direct substantial harm to queer kids. Queers in the Muslim world deal with brutality and levels of conflict we can hardly imagine. 

I do think it is important to keep in mind that, while Muslim society is a far more brutal place to be queer, most Christian denominations and churches still hold on to and teach homophobic ideology. The Catholic church is nearly the size of the Muslim world, and its official position is that homosexuality = ""grave depravity"" and ""contrary to natural law."" There is [no such thing](http://www.npr.org/2013/05/20/184829036/bans-of-same-sex-marriage-can-take-a-psychological-toll) as nonviolent, passive, or loving homophobia. 

I think it is important to recognize the distinctions between Christian homophobic ideology, and Muslim homophobic ideology, and what importing mainstream Muslim ideology means for the West. However, all of the times Ive had the shit kicked out of me, hid in the closet and bullied other queers, attempted suicide as a teen, been tortured, when I was abused in ex-gay therapy, when I was kicked out of the house at 15, can be traced to Christian ideology. Christianity still remains the greatest threat to queers in America, and too many people are silent about it.

&gt;But there are reports from survivors!

Not a single one of the accounts of multiple shooters holds much ground, IMO.

""I saw a guy standing next to him, you know what I mean? I don't know.. I don't know"" - Yeah, you don't know, we can tell.

""His face didn't look scared, so *definitely* more than one shooter"" - Come on.. Not scared so he's *definitely* a mass murderer? 

""Holding the door from the outside"" - Well, we have video of a guy admitting to doing this, and he certainly didn't seem like an accomplice, just misjudged how to help correctly.

""Yelling 'allah-ca-bak' (Allah-akbar, presumably), er I don't know how to say it."" - Can't even correctly remember a very often-said phrase, yet we're relying on her testimony of multiple shooters?

Humans are very, very good at lying to themselves and filling in the blanks, and eyewitness testimony is notoriously inaccurate, and when half of her quotes are followed with ""I don't know.."" it just doesn't hold a lot of merit to me. 

The account of him on the phone holds the most water, but didn't they say he was on the phone *with the police* during that time? Maybe she just misheard things? Maybe ""there are snipers outside"" is referring to the police, not that the shooter had a team of snipers literally waiting outside (Seriously, this seems pretty unreasonable that there was a whole ""team,"" yet there's no other accounts of this team from other sources).

The other reasonings I've heard had to do with ""The gun was shooting way too fast, there had to be at least two people,"" which I don't feel is a very safe assumption unless the person who said that is fairly well trained with firearms. There was an account of an 'accomplice' but it turned out to be people he interacted with before the shooting, and were halfway across the state at the time of the shooting.

Honestly the closest thing to an accomplice I see was his sister (?) who he sold the house to for 10$ or whatever it was. 

I'm on board with the general feeling of ""Something isn't right, here"" but I don't think the multiple shooters/~~accomplices~~ thing holds much merit. (E: Won't rule out an accomplice *somewhere*, be it in the country or a guy just telling him what to do from across the world, but I don't think he had anyone assisting him AT the club, let's put it that way).

The original argument that personality disorders are mental illness however is also still true according to NIH.

https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/personalitydisorders.html

&gt;Personality disorders are a group of mental illnesses. They involve long-term patterns of thoughts and behaviors that are unhealthy and inflexible. The behaviors cause serious problems with relationships and work. People with personality disorders have trouble dealing with everyday stresses and problems. They often have stormy relationships with other people.

In 2002 there was a [paper published](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/180/2/110) with this conclusion: 

&gt;The historical reasons for regarding personality disorders as fundamentally different from mental illnesses are being undermined by both clinical and genetic evidence. Effective treatments for personality disorders would probably have a decisive influence on psychiatrists' attitudes.

That same paper goes on to say [..people with schizotypal personalities are at increased risk of schizophrenia] which is why the distinction between the two is often conflated (which was my mistake).

Currently the NIH and DSM reflect that personality disorders are a type of mental illness. In either case it is an issue of semantics.

If you want to argue semantics you can do that, persons not specifically in the fields of psychology could care less about distinctions between them. For the purposes and context of my original statement the usage is correct in the sense that it was a simile comparison as religious belief is not considered by any scientific community to be a mental illness or disorder (yet).

The transfer of fully automatic weapons between US civilians has been tightly regulated since 1934, under the National Firearms Act (NFA).  Since then, transfer of such weapons has required registration with the ATF, payment for a special stamp for each transfer, and (more recently) background checks on the individual receiving the transfer.  The process can take 6 to 9 months to complete.

Since 1986, the domestic manufacture or importation of new fully automatic weapons in or into the US for sale to the civilian market has been prohibited.  Only police and armed forces uses of such new manufactured fully automatic weapons has been legal since that date.  However, all registered fully automatic weapons already in existence and complying
with the terms of the 1934 act have remained in circulation and transferable, under the existing terms of that 1934 act.  These guns are ""grandfathered"" legal, effectively, since the 1986 act only related to new manufacture or import.  As a result of this restriction, the price of fully transferable fully automatic firearms increased significantly on the restricted supply, and these days runs ~$10,000 to $50,000 per weapon, or 20-50 times the
price of similar items that are only semi-automatic.

It is technically possible to convert semi automatic weapons to fully automatic and the process it not very difficult.  It is illegal and has been illegal since 1934, but it is an evadable law.  It involves some ""gunsmithing"" and some replacement of parts, but it is within the capabilities of a small machine shop and requires no special tools or expert knowledge.  Some models of weapons are easier to convert than others (e.g. simple blow
back submachineguns are easier to convert to full auto than e.g. an AR-15).  The price gap between new manufacture semi automatic weapons and legally transferable fully automatic weapons provides some incentive for criminal gunsmiths to convert weapons for profit, but they risk their livelihoods doing so, and the resulting fully automatic weapons cannot legally be transferred, restricting their market to criminal buyers.

Criminal groups have ready access to fully automatic weapons both from foreign manufacture and from illegal conversions undertaken by their own operatives or in small shops abroad. Latin American drug gangs have many fully automatic weapons.  Fully automatic AKs are widely available in much of the world for prices as low as $400 to 500, and in some places for half that (e.g. Pakistan tribal areas).  The same networks that can smuggle drugs and engage in human trafficking can readily smuggle fully automatic weapons past first world controls.  But these are all criminal activities that require organization to carry out.

The single most likely route for a lone gunman shooter to acquire fully automatic firearms would be converion of legally obtained semi automatic weapons by the shooter themselves. This would require some detailed technical knowledge, gunsmithing skills, and a modest shop. But anyone intent on multiple homicide would not be stopped by the act itself being illegal. Criminally obtained fully automatic weapons transferred from criminal organizations like drug cartels, presumably just for money, would be the second most likely route, and would only require criminal contacts and money, without any technical knowledge.

You only have a few options to solve this.

1. Stricter gun laws, background Checks, etc

2. Greater funds for public education in handling of firearms and programs to solve mental health issues

3. Greater education and social programs to lessen poverty and lower crime rates.

I often hear Republicans suggest that we should better arm the police and citizenry to solve the issue, but then that seems to undercut the historical basis for the second anendment in the 1st place, namely, allowing us to keep and bear arms to defend us from tyranical government.

I got tinder app and began swiping girls. Got this young looking chick and started chatting. She was very forward to say the least - even by the British standards. She told me that she's 16 ( I actually asked if she's already 16 or turning this year, it was the former). 16 is a legal age in UK btw.

Anyway, she wanted to meet and bang. She wanted me to tell her what I'll do to her once I get her in bed. I felt something was off and she was quite rude, which I don't really like. She also looked kinda young and it would feel really awkward (I was 24 at the time).

Fast forward few weeks she starts sending nudes on whatsapp, saying she's drunk and wants to bang. I was interested initially but then she started making demands (buy booze, come in 1h etc). 

So I bailed.. Anyway after about 2 years I read this recent article in a newspaper that a ""15 year old was missing for 2 days but has been found safe"".

Oh yeah that was her. So I'd be fucking a 13 year old at the time. Lol.

She could report me afterwards, or blackmail me or whatever. To this day I'm thankful that I missed a flipping KT-event sized bullet.

Bump firing isn't a complex mod. It's a method of shooting where you pull the firearm forward, instead of pulling the trigger back, to ""bump"" the trigger against your finger. The result is a recoil assisted reset and pull of the trigger, which gives an oscillating rate of fire. It can be achieved without any modification. It's inaccurate and a great way to burn through ammo. It is mostly done for show, fun, and to get an idea of what an automatic firearm is like to shoot. 

Although it can be achieved without a mod, there are some mods out there, that people use. Rubber bands, a simple dowel, even a belt loop are some of the more common methods used. 

Most people with firearm knowledge know this, and that's why they oppose a ban. They believe banning bump stocks would do absolutely nothing to prevent another crazed maniac from bump firing into a crowd.  A ban would just be another reason for gun-control advocates to pat themselves on the back. 

It would be like banning oak wood, because an arsonist used oak to set a house on fire, all the while, he could've used pine, maple, spruce or any other wood. 

Maybe we should look into getting treatment for the arsonist before he does something evil, and not into banning the fuel he used. 

Just my .02.  

Also the NRA hasn't officially stated their stance on the idea of banning bump stocks. They simply called for the ATF to review them, since bump stocks are relatively new, and the ATF has no policy for them.

1122,6892,do74lw4,thehousebehind,Conservative,Las Vegas shooting,1507684641,"Hello. Centrist lurker here. I've found myself in this conversation few times, on here, and facebook this last week, so I thought maybe I would rattle off points that I feel are lacking in the gun control debate from the pro-rights advocates. I would love to hear some honest responses to these issues that I have come across.  

Frequently I've seen pro-rights folks compartmentalize firearm violence into categories, and use the small numbers of each category as evidence there isn't a problem. If you look at it purely by the numbers it's suicide, gang violence, and then person to person violence. 

Breaking it down... 

Suicide by firearm is the most common form of successful suicide primarily because it's effective, and because there is a preponderance of firearms in America, which provides access. 300 million or so privately owned firearms, give or take. This is approximately one third of all the privately owned firearms in the world.  Suicide frequently is an act performed impulsively for a variety of reasons, and pro-rights people typically take the position that a determined suicidal person will find a way no matter what. This line of argumentation is flawed because it lacks any insight into the causes of suicide, or the intervention options that are available. Suicidal people are desperate for relief, not death. As an interesting side note, in the last few years it was reported that the second leading cause of teenage suicide is firearms related. Their deaths were directly enabled by the availability of guns that were unsecured. Guns purchased presumably for home defense, or hunting...

The second tier is gang related violence. Where do gangs get their firearms? The black market. Where do these guns come from? Legal gun owners, typically. 230,000 legally purchased firearms are stolen annually and sold on the black market. The pro-rights camp, particularly libertarian minded people, will argue that we need to end the drug war, and the problem should clear itself up, as if decades of gang activity would suddenly evaporate. To eliminate the black market for drugs we would have to decriminalize all drugs. If you can find a reason why meth, crack, cocaine, heroin, as well as all the legal controlled substances should be legalized, and why that would be a good way to reduce gun violence, more power to you. I would love to read that reasoning. The fact is that this is impractical because those libertarian minded people are small in number, and the vast majority of people in both parties think that these substances are destructive. Predictably they will all remain illegal, and the black market will remain, along with the gangs that make their money trafficking. 

The third tier is interpersonal violence committed with firearms, which is the smallest number, though still higher than every other comparable country in the western world. This is positively correlated to access to firearms that have been purchased legally. Why? Because of typical patterns in the escalation of violence. If the weapon is present, and the situation is heated enough, the threat that it will be used is dramatically increased. 

Other arguments for the need for armament: personal defense. The NRA claims 2.5 million crimes have been deterred as a result of firearms, with no known evidence, as best I can tell, though I would like to see it if it's available. 

The information I have been able to find doesn't really support the NRA. In 5 years (07-11) there was 29.6 million violent crimes, and 84.5 million property crimes. Firearms were used for defense in 235,700 and 103,000 of those instances respectively. It's also interesting to note that over half of the perpetrators of property crime have no weapons whatsoever. 

A better stat to look at might be the number of instances where justifiable homicide was committed in self defense. Annually those number about 200, depending on the year. To go with that is an annual rate of about 100 hundred burglary related homicides. 

The bottom line is that one of the main arguments for gun ownership is the fear of being the victim of a violent crime or having your property stolen. In the big picture the risk of being a victim is ridiculously small. Pro-rights people will argue that they are preparing for what-if scenarios, like what if it happened to you? Imagine your family looking down the barrel of a gun...so on and so forth. This is an Appeal to Emotion fallacy, as they are using your emotional reaction to that idea to sway you to their side as opposed to the facts. 

That isn't to say that your risk for home invasion isn't greater in certain areas, but overall it is very small. 

Finally, we get to the nut of it. The intent of the 2nd Amendment. The Supreme Court has upheld, and expanded gun rights repeatedly in accordance with our history, and legal documents.

Since I've covered self defense, I will just jump to defense of the individual from a tyrannical government. First off, who gets to decide when a government is tyrannical? Then define what is meant by tyranny. Then look at our nation, and it's  historical pattern of upholding individual rights despite those in power. Then look at our historical pattern of regularly holding elections. Then look at our military which is honor bound to defend these core principles of freedom and liberty. Does it seem likely to you that at any time in the foreseeable future there will be a moment when we stoop to what is historically been known as tyranny? Look the those historical instances of it and ask yourself if you can even conceive of it occurring here.

I won't say it's impossible, but the risk is extraordinarily low. But lets say the threat is real...

There are 55 million gun owners, owning 300 million firearms. 7 million of those gun owners possess more than 100 guns. There are a total of 1,281,900 active military, and 801,200 in reserve, with around 200 million total small arms. 

In the evident of a hostile take over of the country by a tyrannical entity, how many of them do you think would maintain allegiance to a government that represents what they have sworn to oppose? And even if they did, do you think they have the manpower needed to completely disarm the populace? 

Just some things that pop to mind. I think if you can come up with sound arguments in a fact based way to counter these points you might be onto something from a debate perspective.

Some remained outwardly Jewish. In his book To Eiminate the Opiate Rabbi Antelman states that Israel traces back almost all anti-Israel activists to Frankists.

Grabs on his nuts but just what if

His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit

You can get erased from the ""book of life"" as you put it.  Someone can be a believer and then fall away from the faith.  take Judas Iscariot for an example. Or Simon Peter.

Also you make a point about how a Christian wouldn't have ordered these terrible acts (holocaust, the associated human experiments, unprovoked war, etc). And I would say you're right.  There are things in the bible stated as being ""mortal sin"". These are sins that are the same as what youll find in the 10 commandments. They aren't new inventions.  But they're set apart from the rest because it is said that a person cannot commit these sins and have Christian faith simultaneously. By their horrific nature, at the time of commiting, the individual is faithless. And as such, if they were to die in the process of commiting it, would go to hell directly.


Edit: comparing judas Iscariot to Hitler is a good thing to do here. Not because Judas committed conspiracy to murder, but because of suicide.  It is widely accepted that suicide while in a state of despair and hopelessness will award the individual a one way ticket to hell as well.

The first time they met, Moore allegedly offered to watch Leigh while her mother went inside the courthouse for a custody hearing. Leigh's mother remembers this and says so on-the-record in the article:

&gt;“He said, ‘Oh, you don’t want her to go in there and hear all that. I’ll stay out here with her,’ ” says Corfman’s mother, Nancy Wells, 71. “I thought, how nice for him to want to take care of my little girl.”

Court documents confirmed that this custody hearing happened:

&gt;The Post confirmed that her mother attended a hearing at the courthouse in February 1979 through divorce records. Moore’s office was down the hall from the courtroom.

Leigh told two friends about the incident at the time. She also told her mother some years later:

&gt;Two of Corfman’s childhood friends say she told them at the time that she was seeing an older man, and one says Corfman identified the man as Moore. Wells says her daughter told her about the encounter more than a decade later

One of those friends, Betsy Davis, went on-the-record in the article:

&gt;Betsy Davis, who remains friendly with Corfman and now lives in Los Angeles, says she clearly remembers Corfman talking about seeing an older man named Roy Moore when they were teenagers. She says Corfman described an encounter in which the older man wore nothing but tight white underwear. She says she was firm with Corfman that seeing someone as old as Moore was out of bounds.

&gt;“I remember talking to her and telling her it’s not a good idea,” Davis says. “Because we were so young.”

The second friend also spoke to the Post (albeit off the record):

&gt;A second friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing her job, has a similar memory of a teenage Corfman telling her about seeing an older man.

In total, the article was based on interviews with 30 sources:

&gt; This account is based on interviews with more than 30 people who said they knew Moore between 1977 and 1982, when he served as an assistant district attorney for Etowah County in northern Alabama, where he grew up.


If you don't believe these details, that's your prerogative  - but you shouldn't ignore that they're in WaPo's article.

Couldn't give me a reasonable explanation, you had to give me the armchair psychologist explanation?  Especially with the "" classic "" that's classic armchair speak. 

That's not good enough of an explanation. I'm sorry. In a court of law you can't just write off something like that because you think you have the power to diagnose someone as long as it fits your narrative. 

Why isn't their an official investigation underway? Because I can honest to god believe that revealing to truth to the American public would mess with national security. I can easily believe it's safer for the country for certain information to stay secret. 

Also it was officially covered up by people of influence is another fantastic reason there isn't an ongoing investigation. If you get to make assumptions I also get to, so I assume you believe Hilary's email matters, and Benghazi have been taken care of? I mean they went through a process similar to that of the warren commission. I mean she literally needed the head of the fib and the attorney general to make the decision..

So it's either the establishment has the power to destroy investigations or it doesn't, keeping in mond the 60s ability to control, and stop information from hitting the public. ( no internet) 

&gt;taken out of context

Oh yeah that's not how a court of law works. Things can't be thrown out because you say it was taken out of context. Everything is on the table. And those jfk files are releasing a lot of info that describes the cia capabilities for subversion and violence. 

&gt;whole paragraph of armchair psychology.. No one cares armchair  psychology that shit doesn't convince anyone on this sub

&gt;every major investigation says one shooter. 

Not the house select committee on assassination. Which said there was a high probability of 2 shooters aka whole story is bullshit. 

See if you orchestrated this assassination, had immediate access to the crime scene,Patsy's , and bodies, while also having major Influence of local law inform cent and future investigations I can easily see this being a coverup. 

Also I will stop the onslaught and say the president of the United States thinks that bobombs went off at the same time the planes hit the the World Trade Center. It's on record.

What has happened in our country, especially within the last 10 years, that is causing these people to get in this mindset where they wanna kill large amounts of people?

I've been toying with a very similar variation of this question(s).

We've had guns since the birth of the nation, and public schools for  a*very* long time.

Why since 1999 (the Columbine shootings) has this been happening.

Why not during the 60's and the Civil Rights movement (for example)? Shit was pretty heated back then. 

People can blame guns and ""mental health"" all they like, but we have to ask why are people *""crazier""* now rather than then in this case.

Something is clearly going on here. Banning guns (as many on the left want) doesn't even begin to address the underlying problem. It's like treating a disease by forcing everyone to wear hazmat suits when in public.

Within hours pictures emerged from the attacker's living room showing books about Nazi Germany and membership ties to some extreme right orgs around the world etc.

But what followed immediately in the media really took me back. The news coverage of this death leading right up to the election night was 24/7. Her husband (who has now quit his charities over female harrassment) took to a stage in London live on national state TV (BBC) and urged everyone to vote to stay in Europe because 'it was what Jo would have wanted'.

After the election, there wasn't one minute of coverage about Jo, and very little about the murderer's court case which I found pretty odd. It was a bit like the Vegas coverage, one minute it was non stop, the next it had vanished like it no longer served its intended narrative.

1377,73522,dummu63,cfuse,The_Donald,Stoneman Douglas High School shooting,1519261996,"&gt; Most of what you wrote where just a lot of random attacks on women and made up facts

1. Single mothers are a disaster for everyone. The family they destroy, the children's lives they diminish, even themselves. All of this is proven by statistical data that is in dispute by **no-one**. Not even you. Ergo, the factors that *create* single mothers (primarily women's voluntary choices) are of critical import to this conversation. That this can paint women in an unflattering light is irrelevant. 

    Some men can accept that women are human and capable of making mistakes, and some men think women are perfect flawless angels. How can anyone have a conversation about agency and responsibility when they won't accept criticism of the individuals involved *solely because of their genitals*?

1. Made up facts are not a thing. The words you're looking for are either *falsehood* or *lie*. If you're going to call me ignorant or deceitful at least have the courage of your convictions.

&gt; Women do initiate more divorces then men, but it is not 80%, and the #1 reason for the higher percentage is not adultery as you imply but crime by the man- usually incarceration from drugs or dui- when the man is in jail a divorce proceeding is pretty common since wives don’t want drunks and junkies around their kids

1. What figure would you like to use? It's always above 50%, and it's always the vast majority. That precludes a random distribution and indicates a clear trend. I do not see how that can be denied.

1. I do not imply adultery, I explicitly state divorce is a product of voluntary choice. What choice is far less relevant than whether there's a choice and how easy that choice is. 

    Whilst there are certainly elements of female sexual choices that are relevant to the discussion of marriage, divorce, and single motherhood, ultimately in the Western Liberal tradition we respect individual liberty. People should be allowed to make free choices wherever possible, inclusive of choices that can be harmful to themselves. However, I am reluctant to allow individuals easy and unpunished choices where those choices have obvious and causal negative outcomes to third parties.

    Even you state that divorce is cheap and easy, yet somehow you are now going to argue that women are poor damsels that are only divorcing because ""he done her wrong""? Plain old misandry and victim blaming. It's obvious and lazy, and it's no argument.

1. The beauty of criminology is that it produces extremely detailed statistics. We also have good enough divorce statistics. Your maths doesn't square. If you're going to make an assertion about an incidence then at least make sure the figure is correct.

&gt; Also, men don’t WANT custody of their kids- they are trying to completely abandon them during divorce in 85% of cases- that’s why we have mandatory child Support laws, if it was up to the vast majority of men the would literally stop being fathers the second the chose to and would contribute nothing to their children ever

1. Okay, let assume that your assertion is true. So what? I'm not making an argument for letting everyone run around like adult children doing whatever the fuck they like no matter the consequences, I'm making an argument for the opposite. I don't care if you have a penis - you made choices and you are now stuck with the consequences of that. If you're unhappy that's your problem to address. Child welfare is of primacy to me, and I DGAF how many adults of either gender get forced to foot their rightful costs in improving it.

1. As it stands, a man pays for the woman (by way of 'child' support) and that system encourages single motherhood. If men are forced to take responsibility for their own children nothing precludes that man giving the child to the woman and having the same financial arrangement voluntarily that is currently forced by the state. The issue here is that we all know that a man will keep and raise his own children in preference to paying his ex-wife a dime. He'll be paying to support *them* and not *her*. You don't like the idea of *real* child support much, do you? 

1. Regardless of all other factors, in the instance of a dissolution of marriage with a dependent minor there must be custody/financial arrangements made for that minor. We know for a fact that where primary custody is held by the woman the outcomes are worse than where the primary custody is held by a man. This is independent of whether there is financial support from the father or not. There's simply no other solution than to alter the default custody arrangement if we expect to improve outcomes for children. What other options do we have here? I'm open to suggestions other than 'keep everything the way it is and let lawyers like myself fill up our bank accounts as society burns to the ground'.

&gt; You actually are advocating for financial abortion at the same time as saying men should have universal sole custody of children in all circumstances- hat doesn’t make any fucking sense

1. Tying custody and financial responsibility together makes perfect sense. The entire problem of single motherhood has its genesis in decoupling costs from choices. Women get to make children they don't have to pay for, and just like in any situation where people (regardless of their gender) are allowed to exploit a resource at little cost to themselves the majority will do so regardless of the costs to others.

1. Not universal, default custody. Like any matter before a court if one can show cause then I'm not opposed to exceptions being made. However, ""because she shat it out"" isn't a sufficient reason to give a woman custody. If she comes along and can *prove* (not with pure hearsay as currently is the case) things like abuse or neglect then I'm all for considering her for custody. There's also nothing stopping her getting off her lazy ass and getting a better job than him and arguing she's a better provider. 

&gt; Also, no just fucks a woman one time who they are MARRIED to and has a child- these are there wives and children- I understand you have no value for women and children and literal used the term blood money to describe the value of an aborted child but I think that’s a tad horrible

1. The minimum requirement to create a child in the standard fashion is a single act of intercourse. Whether or not other acts occur is irrelevant to whether there's a basis to legal claim or not. You have a kid that's biologically related (even that's not a requirement in some jurisdictions, only that a parental relationship exists) and you have a financial claim on the father. You know this better than anyone - you're a lawyer and  you'd never take a support case to court where it could be proven that the people in question never had sex and the man had no parental relationship with the child.

1. As it stands a foetus is worth nothing at all. A woman can have an abortion without having to inform the father, and without having to respect his wishes in the matter. She can also bring the child to term in with the same conditions. She has all the choices, and virtually none of the costs. 

    I'm sorry if the phrase blood money bothers you, but I am of the opinion that when someone has a choice to kill another's child, and then takes that choice, that there should be a reckoning for that. Ideally that women would be prevented from committing murder at all, but as the child is effectively part of her body until it is viable she has the right to excise and kill it. That is a right our society gives, and that's a right I support (regardless of my own opinion on the exercising of that right). What I do not accept is that right to be free of consequences - if you wilfully end a life for your own convenience and we don't have the option for a custodial sentence then you must pay in some other way. Money is the least imposition on a woman under those circumstances, but I would be willing to consider imprisonment or indentured servitude as alternative choices to be available to women who kill men's children.

    The easiest method to discourage a behaviour is to increase its cost to those exercising it. I'm not against abortion, I'm against unilateral decisions with externalised costs. If a man wants that child and the woman wants to kill it then I'm not stopping her from either course of action, I'm just asserting that all parties involved in that situation pay costs associated with their choices. As the choices and consequences aren't inherently linked the function of the law in that situation must be to correct for that. Rights must never exist without their cocomittent responsibilities.

1. I think killing children because they're an inconvenience or bringing them to term because they'll be an income are equally disgusting. Congrats, we all have deeply held opinions. Hooray for us.

&gt; Honestly,I am not going to talk to you anymore, you are a very upsetting person- just google how actual divorce law works

Your withdrawal is accepted. Honestly I thought you'd have more to say, but apparently you're not much chop when it comes to debate.

These are probably the same people that say the statement ""shall not be infringed"" doesn't actually mean ""shall not be infringed."" We do know that the founding fathers we're okay with private citizens owning and using **cannons** as self defense, and they were also big fans of the Puckle gun, which is the first machine gun made in 1718 as well as the Giramdoni Air Rifle in 1779 which had a 30 round capacity.

Do you realize how silly that sounds that we need a amendment saying that our military can use guns against enemies? Of course the military will use guns, or whatever tools they can to defeat an enemy, they don't need a amendment telling them they can.

Second point from this, the Bill of Rights isn't about what people can or can't do, it's about what the **government** can't do. The **government** can't squash your free speech, the **government** can't force you into a religion, and the **government** can't tell you that you aren't allowed to defend yourself against people trying to harm you.

As a Canadian IPSC/3 Gun shooter who owns an AR, I know they aren’t any more dangerous than a mini14 (or a CZ858 for that matter) but the data brought up in this article is, I think, consistent with the argument that more regulations also lead to attacks with less dangerous weapons. 

There’s lots of good arguments against more gun control in the US, but I don’t think pointing at Canada is a good one.

Yes, he really is, and it's not unreasonable.  Even if you look at murders per capita New Hampshire is doing a lot better than London.  And I think we all need to ask ourselves why we expect an urban environment to be more crime-ridden (per capita) than a non-urban one.  It's not the presence of guns or loose gun laws.  As the commenter points out above you, New Hampshire's laws are very relaxed, and I haven't checked this but I expect they have a higher rate of gun ownership as well.  So *guns* and *gun laws* are not the deciding difference between St. Louis and New Hampshire.

Imagine how many unreported cases occurr where the threat of gun protection prevented crime? This makes gun ownership especially important when you consider this. Yet we rarely hear this argument.

Children used to bring their guns to schools and put them in their lockers during hunting season, shotguns and rifles. Schools used to have competitive shooting as a sport. And in all of this, there never really was an issue like mass shootings, and if it did happen it was so sparingly. But we have a culture that's raising people to not respect life, people with less parental discipline and care than ever before, people being told they're mere animals and life has no meaning, people with no understanding nor belief of cosmic accountability. They desire fame, they desire a hedonistic lifestyle, all the while having a nihilistic worldview in the process, that nothing really matters in the end. I was one of these people as a teenager, and I could have easily gone down this path in certain situations...

There is a strong, and I mean very strong, correlation between prison inmates and single-parent (mostly mothers) household. The family Court and Welfare system doesn't help that at all, especially with no-fault divorces. Kids are being taught more than ever that truth is subjective and that there is no absolute moral principle to adhere to. All the while being pumped up full of drugs that, frankly, are more harmful than helpful. TV doesn't help, movies doesn't help, modern music doesn't help.

All of this combined create a culture that had a tendency to cultivate monsters, monsters like the guy who shot up Las Vegas, the Church in Texas, Parkland, etc. We're looking for bandaids without addressing the real root of the sickness.

You want this stuff stopped? You want violent crimes to go down? It'll help to allow firearms more accessible to Law-abiding citizens, but it'd require a radical cultural shift, we're talking from the Libertines to Victorian England, to deal with it.

Ughh, (begin rant): We shouldn't even compare it to the Tommy gun even, these are self-loading rifles, we've had them since a decade before WWI. Most of these people are angry or whatever because they don't know shit about guns. Find me one person who was raised around guns say this is a gun control issue. You can't because we already have some tight gun control. 

The term '*semiautomatic*' annoys me, I still think it was made to scare people in the media. Anyway, people can see an M1 Garand or a SVT40 and say '*that's reasonable to own*' but show them an AR15 and all of a sudden '*HURR DURR ASSAULT RIFLE, BAN IT!*' despite the fact both guns operate the same and are self-loading. When a person hears semiautomatic it kinda implies it can be made fully auto, it's a term to scare people. 

I've seen several people rant about how it's crazy you can own a full-auto rifle *(You can't, unless you're a gun dealer.)* and how these '*assault rifles*' are unnecessary. Well again, unless you're a level 3 gun dealer you can't own an assault rifle, which is a full-auto rifle used by the military. Nearly **EVERY** point these people make is based out of ignorance. Before I talk to anyone about gun control if they don't know what the NFA is, or what an assault rifle is we can't go further because you lack knowledge to even debate the matter. 

Let's disregard the fact full-auto rifles cant legally be obtained and are just as dangerous and effective as self-loading rifles. If people were familiar with current gun regulations they would see how crazy these antigun people and their arguments are. Are they familiar with the NFA? You can't get more control than that really and even the NFA overreaches in places. 

One of the things I try explaining to people is the reason we can trace guns and what not is because the majority of gun owners are responsible owners who go through the right channels. 

You eliminate the right to own a gun legally, you end the ability to trace guns in order to solve homicides and other crimes, because guess what? Criminals tend to not follow rules. When a shooting does occur 99% of the time it can be linked to someone, find out if it was reported stolen, etc. Because at some point that gun was likely purchased legally. 

**BUTTT** let's not question the fact a small amount of these people *(shooters)* believe it's okay to go kill a bunch of innocent people. Or the fact almost every mass shooter was on psychiatric medication for some long period of time. After the Boston Bombers our immediate response wasn't to regulate pressure cookers, no different.

My father has been an avid hunter and I've had access to weapons as early as age 5, dislocated my shoulder at age 6 when trying out one of the shotguns we had.
Punishment at home had usually been in the form of getting a mild beating, have I been pissed off about that ? Of course. Did I think about harming either of my parents ? Yes I did, I guess you call that intrusive thoughts. Did I go grab any of the 12 guns and rifles we had to make good on that thought? Of course not as I was not mentally unstable.
A ban on weapons is not going to solve the problem, solving mental health issues will.

I've been thinking and chatting with people from all over, and before antifa now became a terrorist organization (think of the time right before they took off), what we are seeing is simply the effects of war. Not a civil war. But a war, because if you remember, we are still fighting in Afghanistan (the longest war in record US history), and the 4th being Iraq, 2 very long wars we've all seen in record breaking numbers. Just to put into perspective, Moro Rebellian is 2nd (1899-1913) and 3rd is Northwest Indian War (1785-1795). See those years? These 4 wars are longer than the war for Independence, 2 of which WE ARE LIVING (LIVED) THROUGH. Trust me, if we were in some sort of 2nd civil war, there'd be no doubting whatsoever, there'd be no ""um, maybe?"" You aren't in a civil war. 

This all because we are at war, and trust me, losing is not good for us either (look at Germany during WW1 and WW2 loses). 

What we are dealing with is just a modern warfare insurgent. ""Agitators"". It's how it always worked; they can recruit just about anyone and they have proof. Single mother of 5 children? Sorry you must get mocked relentlessly all the time, men must call you horrible names, tell you things like ""What a whore. I'd never raise your children."" etc, etc. Addicted to pain killers? Wow, someone did that to you? Here, let me help with this bandaid. 

I only know this because I studied antifa heavily for 3 years; just online garb, nothing in person. 

But labelling Antifa as a hate group is deadly. I mean, a terrorist organization. Most of them are just online-doers who are literally ""just having fun"", it takes the serious dangerous ones to meet up in person. Mostly, they are just annoying; but to say I haven't learned 1 thing from the antifa when I was undercover is lying. The fact that I even learned one positive thing out of that organization is to say *something*. 

For example, I do understand why they promote things like ""anti-fat hate"", because interestingly; every country that has people who complain about being too chubby, or taunt fat people, are easily taken over by communists or Islam.

Being obsessed with atheism and anti-religious dogma is a problem. If you actively despite religious people, you're a piece of shit, IMO. I think this guy was a far lefty radicalized into thinking religious conservatives were literally nazis and trying to destroy everything he held important. I mean if you listen to CNN religiously (the irony is fantastic, I know), that's exactly what you'll think. It reminds me a lot of ISIS propaganda. Seriously, read that shit sometime just so you know why this is happening. Sargon recently read a passage out of one of their magazines that described why they hate the west, and it reminded me so much of how CNN treats conservatives, libertarians, and even classical liberals (actual liberals).

I think the fastest way to disavow yourself of this stupid radical notion in most cases is to just actually go talk with people. If this guy left his gun in his car, went in, and spent 30 minutes in service with these people and realized they'd accept him, talk with him, and legitimately have interest in him even though he's a total stranger, and even if he disagrees with their religion, maybe he'd have realized he had been lied to by the media.

Generally they argue against what they imagined God to be as a child.

Their image or understanding stops at the point of a loss of faith. Then continue to find reasons to argue against their childhood thinking.

The break is self defined.

""Well I thought God made sure everyone had cake on their birthday. Know what I didn't get cake. There is no God.""

But they retain morality, generally. This is built-in. I believe religion is a codification of that reality.

Pain and suffering that attends evil is real too. Another branch of ""Atheism"". They start out believing, then after some things,.some this and that, the hurting starts.

Instead of looking at that, blaming the behavior they blame the ""learned"" .bits. This is primarily their own culture and learning

I am convinced a very large number of the SJW angry gals suffer from the emotional abortion hangover, for example. It is forbidden to talk about this, of course. It is also supposed to be nothing, just a clump of cells.

So they are isolated, angry, and do not know how to solve it, how to stop the pain. 

Again, instead of looking at the root behavior that caused the conflict and sadness, they blame the culture, what they Learned. 

This comes off of the ""Blank slate"" idea. That ethics, religion etc are a social construct, an  external thing,.
I believe this is a profound error. Religion is a codification of a functioning human's inner workings. A way of explaining the reality. This crosses time, language and culture, without exception. They get it wrong too, of course, But the central role is invariable, it is always there.

I do not spend a lot of time attempting to explain why, etc, or on details of religions beyond generally agreed Good vs Evil, which is incredibly constant 
through history and culture.

Biggest bits to a happy self for me have been: Forgiveness,and two elements of faith: there is a point to all of this, there is relief from suffering.

1937,2884,cxv4s9y,War-Damn-America,Conservative,San Bernardino attack,1449819668,"Ok I will try and answer this. So first off your making a big assumption that the US military would be involved with disarming the population. People in the military tend to lean right politically and even the ones that don't still respect the Constitution which means they would not be too happy about taking away everyone's firearms.


But let's say hypothetically the military is on board. So first off it's hard to nail down a number of gun owners in this country because many states don't keep tabs/lists. Plus many people me included are not fully willing to talk to random surveyors about our lives, especially guns. So a pinpoint number on gun owners is difficult, but from quickly googling a few news articles put it at about a third of all Americans own guns which mean there are around 100,000,000 gun owners in America give or take. Which is a lot of people with firearms. And the idea is many of these 100 million people will stand up and protect their right to bear arms.


Now it would be unreasonable to expect every individual to stand up and fight the government, but say even just 10 percent of these hundred million people is still 10 million people. That would be a lot of people fighting what boils down to a guerrilla war on their home turf. Now even spread over the whole country it would be hard for any kind of military force to deal with that. I mean in Afghanistan western anyalists believe that the Taliban has around 35,000 people as a whole and not all of them are fighting at any given time. Even with 35,000 people which pales in comparison to 10 million it can be hard to deal with and some people, especially here on Reddit say it's unwinable, but somehow if this were to transpire in the US it would be a cake walk for the government. Which honestly doesn't make much sense if you ask me.


So essentially through the use of local militias and guerrilla tactics the US populous defend themselves from a tyrannical government. It doesn't matter if you have predator drones, JDAMS, tanks, and other modern weapons because at the end of the day the Government just wouldn't be able to kill 10,000,000 people who are waging a guerrilla war they would be overwhelmed. And that's estimating that only 1 in three Americans own firearms and then out of that only one in ten would be willing to defend that right with force.

Here are my sources I used. I know there not the greatest but just simple googling Hahah.

A process in which we change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that despite the abundance of information no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in interest of defending themselves their families and their communities and their country.  

Four Steps:

1) Demoralization - 15 to 20 years.  Minimum number of years to educate 1 generation of students of the country of your enemy to be exposed to the ideologies of their enemy. 

A person who is demoralized is unable to assess true information.  The facts tell nothing to him.  Even if I shower him with information and authentic proof, documents, pictures...he will refuse to believe it until he is going to receive a kick in his fat bottom when a military boot crashes him.  

2) Destabilization - This time the subverter doesn't care about your ideas or what you do.  Economy, foreign relations and defense systems.  Marxist/Leninist ideas are astounding in the USA.  

3) Crisis - May only take up to 6 weeks to bring a country to crisis.  

4) Normalization - A cynical expression which may last indefinitely.  If you allow the country to come to crisis by promising all kinds of goodies and the paradise of earth to everyone to eliminate the principal of free market capitalization, destabilize the economy and impose big brother government in DC.  

""Your leftists all this professors all this beautiful civil rights defenders...they are instrumental in the process of subversion.  Only to destabilize a nation.

2036,20131,d4i2xpp,Psyoniix,The_Donald,Orlando nightclub shooting,1466523511,"Dude, ""the Levant"" doesn't refer to Turkey, or Egypt, or Arabia, or Iran either.  The Levant and al-Sham are synonyms.  As I've said, the term ""levant"" is one of the many terms western languages have used to describe the area over the years.  ""Al-Sham"" is just the Arabic word for the same area.  Yes, in Arabic it may also have certain symbolic meaning, but it's also that language's way of expressing the same concept as ""the Levant"".  They are the same geographic region, regardless of any symbolism an ideology applies to one or the other depending on the language.

The acronym ISIS stand for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, not Islamic State in al-Sham.  ISIL stands for Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.  So using ISIL as the name for the group would imply it's desiring more territory than if you use ISIS as the name.  English speakers don't use al-Sham to describe the region.  ISIL is the name that most closely describes their old name, which in Arabic was الدولة الإسلامية في العراق والشام

That transliterates to ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah fī 'l-ʿIrāq wa-sh-Shām, which translates to Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham, which, as we just went over, means the Levant.  If you were to translate ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah fī 'l-ʿIrāq wa-sh-Shām literally, al-Sham would be translated as Syria, which, as I said in my earlier post, would invoke the idea of the modern country Syria, and not the historic region, which referred to the entire coast, like the Levant does.  Because this would be confusing in English and some other western languages, the ISIL term was invented instead.  ISIS was still used by most, however, because it is the most literal translation despite its imprecision, and because it describes the actual location of the group's territory more accurately than ISIL does.

As far as the age of the terms go, it's irrelevant to argue that due to the fact that, as I said in my earlier post, the west has used many terms to describe the same area.  The written Arabic language does not precede the oldest of these terms, so regardless of how Muslims want to invoke the symbolism of a 4000 year old person, the term itself is not nearly that old, so it's really them who are projecting onto us.  Islam has only been around for less than 1400 years, and the Arabic script for about 1600 years at the most, so if that analysis is correct, it just goes to show how much Muslims like to make up history.  Robert Spencer is a good resource to examine Islamic history in that regard.

The long and short of it is that the Levant and al-Sham refer to the same region.  I've studied Islam for many years, so I know the symbolism of using al-Sham.  It's similar to how they use Iraq to refer to the region of Mesopotamia (and not just the modern day country of Iraq).  They use these terms regardless of the language being spoken not because they refer to different regions, but because they invoke symbolism.  Luckily, I'm not a goat fucker, so I'll use the words we have in English when I speak English, and the words they have in Arabic if I speak Arabic.

What you get, a very basic AR-15 with a very basic adjustable stock and grip.  A standard S&amp;W factory trigger feel, good clean break but definitely gritty (not much polishing done on the metal, had to clean up my M&amp;P Shield 9mm trigger too).  Tons of features most AR-15 owners want gone too, dust shield and forward assist (not necessary but add to the cool factor), no rail on the forward grip for accessories.


They're basically a normal S&amp;W offering (besides wheel guns, S&amp;W does something special to wheel guns).  A very reliable, very basic, mid range gun at a steal of a price.  It's a starter gun for someone without a lot of money but was willing to do their research, more seasoned gun owners would either just buy a stripped lower and build, or pay a little more to get something more desirable.  I wouldn't buy one and customize it because then you're just paying the cost for a better gun, or just go all-in to get the upper and trigger group you want.

2127,593,d4n6ips,agrayk47,Republican,Orlando nightclub shooting,1466828303,"I don't think Cooper was doing that. He was simply stating the hypocrisy of the Florida government who feigned their support (the Florida AG put a rainbow symbol on their website!) When historically and reliably, people like Scott have been staunch opponents of the LGBT community with their legislation. Cooper was demonstrating how in reality, conservatives like Scott don't give a crap about their gay constituents. 

&gt;But you think people should get guns.  This shooting happened because a man had a gun.  He got it legally.  How can you deal with having all this blood on your hands from all of these shootings that have happened that would not have been prevented even if we had more background checks and longer waiting periods?  This could be your fault.  Maybe this is your fault.  Maybe Newtown was your fault, too.

I think people should be allowed to own guns. I also think that they should be made to go through rigorous checks. This is a case Florida has pretty lax gun laws that allowed an unstable piece of garbage to shoot and kill 49 people. 

And when getting into the nuance of certain matters you're always going to seemingly contradict yourself at times when you're a moderate on certain issues. I strongly support a person ability to buy a gun, but there has to be limitations. Just as Scalia stated in opinion of DC v Heller.

But having strict gun laws may not solve every problem. Look at Chicago. To decrease violence you have to go at the root of the problem. Poverty and the people's desire to commit violent crime. If I were a person who didn't support the right to own a gun. Strict gun laws is not the solution. Prohibition doesn't work. You can't get rid of guns by law. The only way you unarmed a population is to create an environment where people do not feel the need to own weapons. 

&gt;And don't bother expressing condolences or pretending you feel bad about these things.  Because you support the Second Amendment.  So your feeling are not at all genuine and no one believes that you grieve.

That makes no sense whatsoever. 

Cooper was simply stating to the conservatives who came out of the woodworks who historically fought against equal rights for all, ""we don't want your feigned condolences because it is clear that you haven't given a shit about the LGBT community in the past.""

This post clearly isn't looking at the deeper factors behind political leanings and gun violence. It's saying ""The Democrats are the violent ones, so what right do they have to talk about gun control?"" It falsely implies that Democrats are fundamentally violent, as opposed to poorer, more disenfranchised, more urban, etc. It's needless us vs. them logic, and trying to treat Democrats as a monolith in order to demonize them.

Might as well say 90% (or whatever) of gun violence is committed by people who take public transit. Even if it's true, how someone gets around is irrelevant to the gun control debate, and it falsely implies that those who take public transit are inherently more violent than those who don't.

&gt;For you to blame/mention 'racial tension' regarding gun violence, you reveal what's likely a politically correct agenda. The most viciously and consistently violent places on earth are black and there's no 'racial tension' in those areas because they are all black.

Wow... Interesting, I guess Africa was just always that fucked up. It must not have been because Europe pillaged it for resources, land, and slaves, redrew land boundaries without regard for tribal and cultural groups, and enslaved its people or made them into second-class citizens. Nope, that'd be too politically correct; there has to be a bad guy! Must be that blacks have turned to gun violence because of their skin color. Makes sense. Everyone knows blacks are just savage by nature... /s

Want to know why so many poor, urban areas in America are filled with mostly minority groups? Racial tension. Here are some reasons why people join gangs (which is where a lot of the gun violence you're mentioning comes from): protection (which sounds very attractive when the alternative is turning to a racist police force), being a minority, (they're socially marginalized, so they have less respect for social institutions, want to be more respected, etc.), poverty (which has persisted from the segregation days), etc. IQ is somewhat relevant, but the lack of quality in urban public schools / lack of money to explore private options is far more important. This isn't being politically correct. It's the truth. Blacks and other minorities aren't inherently more likely to be violent criminals than whites. Claiming the opposite isn't ""calling it how it is"". It's bigotry.", gt The intent of the post is not trying to convey that being a Democrat is what makes you a violent criminal  It s that the same variable s that makes a person,27.0,porniton 27,gtTheintentofthepostisnottryingtoconveythatbeingaDemocratiswhatmakesyouaviolentcriminalItsthatthesamevariablesthatmakesaperson,1204.746,1643.896

Go see your recruiter. They'll make you take a test called the ASVAB which will determine your actual intelligence as apposed to the ACT or SAT which test retained knowledge. Based on your score they'll recommend a job field then schedule you for a date to go to MEPS (Military Entrance Processing Station). After an assload of paperwork they'll send you down there. If you've done drugs that's fine. If you've done a lot of drugs they'll just tell you to lie about it and say you've only experimented. At MEPS you'll go through a series of medical tests to determine eligibility. Assuming you make it through those, you'll sign a preliminary contract stating your intent to join the active duty Marine Force and you'll get a ship-date: the day you go to boot. Until that day you'll do physical training at least once a week with your RS - recruiting station - until you go. When you do go, you'll go through an official swearing in, where you swear your allegiance to both the United States and all those appointed over you. From this point, you'll either go to Parris Island or San Diego (the 2 recruit depots) where your life will be living hell for 13 weeks.

Let's be real about this. They won't come right out and use the term ""confiscation"" because the American people wouldn't have it. Instead, they'll do what authority figures have always done and baby-step towards it. It's the ""frog in a boiling pot of water"" method. Should the government move to straight out confiscate all firearms right now, *man* people would fight against them using the firearms they currently own. However, if they baby-step away all the firearms capable of fighting such a force (isn't is strange how they always attack the AR15 even though a minuscule amount of homicides are committed with them?), confiscating a bunch of handguns and shotguns would be relatively easy. 

No offense, but if you think the leftist elite wouldn't confiscate all firearms if they had to power to do so, you should stop being so naive. That's not an insult, but it *is* the truth.

*Honestly, the resolution is too poor to do much of any comparison. What little I can make out, the chin appears to be completely different - the pink wearing individual has a much shorter jaw line. The vile murderer's jaw line is far more blocky and longer - notice the difference in distance between the bottom lip and what is most likely the end of the chin based upon what can be viewed of the goatee on the highly pixelated anti-Trumper and the murderer. There is a noticeable different between the two. (:43 in the video in the previous post)*

12ga shotgun is very versatile. You can hunt migratory and waterfowl and small and big game. You can change choke, use different kinds of shells and hunt a variety of animals. Or, if you’re not into hunting, you can shoot skeet/trap.  It’s a fun sport. Also, you can defend your home with it. Buy a box of 3 1/4 buckshot and keep it loaded. If someone breaks in or you find someone on your land. Alls you gotta do is point the barrel towards em and fire. No precision necessary. That mother fucker would probably end up dying with 3 1/2 buck depending on the distance. 

If you wanna defend yourself in public, any sub-compact is fine. 9mm’s and .380’s shoot just fine. Glock, ruger, S&amp;W, Berreta, Springfield are all great brands and there’s probably more that I’m missing. People talk shit about the hi-point. They have a good reason since it’s ugly af and isn’t exactly a great gun. But do some research on it. It’s pretty accurate for the price. It’s a great gun to leave under the seat in your truck. If it gets stolen, or dropped, or somehow beat up, then oh well it’s just a hi-point. 

There’s plenty of other guns out there such as AR’s and deer rifles.  It all depends on what you want to do. Like buying a car, if you live (and never really leave)  in the middle of a big city , you aren’t going to buy a ram 2500 6.7 I6 that’s crew cab, long bed, and 4wd.

Too much info, and getting rid of that book is always the first step to dumbing down a population in preparation for tyranny.


It also makes sense to me that everywhere it went on the planet, it left a trail of free nations behind it.


Yeah.


Just what the globalists need right now. A history book with the principals of freedom written all over in it with historical examples.

Let me tell you what I believe.  I think he WAS antifa.  I think he was a deranged person who hated Donald Trump.  I believe that he was radicalized by Islam perhaps and tried to kill as many people as possible.  I do believe the mainstream media is being quiet about all this now because THEY have been spreading the narrative of being violent towards Trump and his supporters.  THEY are kind of guilty for this happening because of their hateful messages, propaganda and tools used to make us look like evil people when we really are not.

I think this man was a deranged leftist.  He wanted to kill as many Trump supporters as possible and he thought ""hey country show! I'm gonna go there and do that one, seems like most people liking country would like Trump"".  Therefore the media cannot comment or even go more into this story because of the nature of what was in that man's room, what he had, who he was OF and if they reported on the truth that he WAS of antifa, after all these years of PROTECTING antifa that the media and left have done, it would be THE final nail in the coffin for them and their narrative completely and wholeheartedly.

But they’re not out killing innocent random people, at least not often. Most the people are being murdered for their own bad decision, not that I’m justifying what they’re doing. It’s just gang violence is going to occur, and that’s way more of a government allowing them to easily profit off of illegal drug sales, just like al Capone made profits off of alcohol sales. By making something fully illegal, you create a trade for it. So like drugs guns shouldn’t be fully illegal for it, but the penalty for automatic weapons, or modified weapons should be extremely heavy, taking decade(s) of imprisonment. Drug laws aren’t strict enough to scare thes people and strict enough to give them something to make big profits from. and they know no one in their right mind is going to snitch on them from the neighborhood because they’ll be left dead as well.

- We are being told the shooter had between [16-23 firearms](http://nypost.com/2017/10/03/the-tricked-out-guns-las-vegas-shooter-used-in-massacre/) (I found different numbers on almost every site I visited)

- 1x [AR-15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FnhUYifgs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=44s), 
1x [.308 AR-10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6REoRsEZGkU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=16s), 
1x ""AK-47 type rifle"", 
4x [Daniel Defense DDM4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfbxyiiIs28&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=17s), 
3x [FN-15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkBq7KXPbgM) (The links are videos of the guns shooting bump fire)

- The shooter had 2 bump stocks. One was attached to an AR-15, but I couldn't find what gun the other was attached to

- In the [picture of Stephen Paddock's room](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/inside-hotel-room-vegas-killer-gun.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=326), you can see an AR on the floor with a bump stock, vertical grip, 50-75 round magazine, and what looks like a holographic sight

- A [holographic sight](http://www.eotechinc.com/hws-service-and-support/faq#92) is accurate up to 300 meters

- Paddock was a little over 350 meters away from the concert (**a**^2 +**b**^2 =**c**^2 where **a** is the [distance from the NW corner of the Mandalay Bay](https://imgur.com/a/EcDi4), **b** is an estimation of 320 ft since the hotel is [480 ft tall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Las_Vegas) and the 32nd floor is about 2/3 up, **c** ends up ~1155 ft or ~352 m)

-  [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ9Y1V-ltUw) of a dude shooting semi auto at 300 yard with a holographic sight. 350 meters is about 384 yards so Paddock was shooting full auto, 384 yards, and at night.

- [A photo of the view](https://i.imgur.com/wnEYhiW.jpg) from the shooter's window

- [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSizVpfqFtw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m11s) of what happens when you shoot an AR-15 full auto continuously. It lasts for 830 rounds of ammunition before it failed completely. It took 6 minutes from the 1st shot to the gas tube melting. Keep in mind that the gun would have become significantly less accurate as the barrel heated and began to warp, even less accurate from 384 yards.

- We know that the entire shooting only lasted [about 10 minutes](http://www.businessinsider.com/timeline-shows-exactly-how-the-las-vegas-massacre-unfolded-2017-10/#1013-pm-police-outside-realise-where-the-shots-are-coming-from-6). Nonstop full auto from a bump stock AR-15 would be around [400-600 rounds per minute](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bump-fire-stock-ar-15-stephen-paddock-guns-deadlier/) which gives us 4000-6000 possible bullets. Now factor in 75 rounds magazines, taking the time to swap out magazines, and switching between only 2 full auto rifles (only 2 bump stocks) and that number goes down by a lot. Paddock also moved across his room at least once since we know 2 windows were blown out. My guess for a ""best"" case scenario? I think an experienced gunman could get off 2000 rounds if he was going as fast as possible and wasn't aiming.

- Here is a really critical piece of evidence. Some guy put together a [synchronized video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2uEKUc0_Vc) of all the shooting videos that got posted online. Obviously I didn't count all the shots and in some places the sound is pretty funky anyway. But if I had to give an estimate, I don't think that more than 1000 rounds were fired. Obviously 1000 rounds is still a lot, but is it enough to get 59 kills and hundreds of injuries?

- Let's be generous and say 80% of the injuries were actually caused by people getting trampled as they tried to escape. That means that 159 people were wounded or killed from a gunshot wound. That means that Paddock had an accuracy of 15.9% or 1 hit for every 6 bullets (if the 1000 round estimate is correct). The crowd was around 22k people so he certainly had a large target.

- The main point disagreement here is whether or not you believe a supposedly untrained 64 year old was able to hit over 150 targets. From nearly 4 football fields away. At night. Using firearms that weren't made to shoot full auto. Hands shaking from adrenaline. All within 10 minutes.

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this. I understand if you still don't agree. Honestly, I do see how it would be possible. I just think it's extremely unlikely.

- I forgot one thing! I went through the trouble of finding videos of all those different rifles being fired with bump stocks because of something really strange I noticed while putting together all this information. *None* of those bump stock videos sound like the gunfire heard in the videos of the shooting. They are all very rapid and uneven whereas the gun Paddock was using sounds much slower and consistent. This isn't conclusive since we still don't know exactly which weapons, ammunition, and attachments he was using.

The company making this unique lithium battery, this report details, is Ultralife Corporation, based in Newark, New York, that specializes in military communications systems for the Pentagon—and whose lead engineer for this particular communication systems development was John Beilman.

Listing himself as a “product design and manufacturing professional”, this report continues, John Beilman was employed by Ultralife Corporation between 2007-2012 where he worked on various top secret communications systems for the US military—thereafter his leaving to become a top engineer at the General Motors research facility located in Rochester New York.

Fearing that Ultralife Corporation had been secretly funneling their US military communications systems to the CIA, this report notes, this past Tuesday (3 October), the FBI raided the home of John Beilman under a secret US Federal Court warrant—and that caused Beilman, less than 12 hours later, during the early morning hours of Wednesday (4 October), to wheel out his severely disabled daughter Nicole into his homes backyard where she was executed, with Beilman then killing himself too—and that was followed 48 hours later (6 October) by the Pentagon awarding Ultralife Corporation new contracts valued at over $49 million."":", According to this report  upon the FBI searching the Mandalay Bay Hotel room used by CIA gun runner Stephen Paddock  a cell phone charger was discovered that had no accompanying,16.0,radioheadtree 16,AccordingtothisreportupontheFBIsearchingtheMandalayBayHotelroomusedbyCIAgunrunnerStephenPaddockacellphonechargerwasdiscoveredthathadnoaccompanying,3055.674,3574.693

sgtrok13 says:

This is what a retired Police 🚨 Officer I know wrote tonight.

So tonight we here that the FBI lied about the timeline in Vegas. No shock here on my part.

This is where I am now with the rapidly collapsing Vegas story and all the seemingly unrelated items from this week.

I believe in my gut what I think is going on is accurate.
1. The Vegas official story (lie) is collapsing.
2. Trumps off handed “Quiet before the storm” comment
3. The leak of Gen. Mattis reminder to the Armed Forces of their sworn duties.
4. VP Pence walking out on the NFL
5. Trump really attacking Corker and Corker letting slip that the establishment is actively trying to stop Trump.
6. The never covered Awan scandel

Vegas was supposed to be another 911 on steroids. The purpose was to derail the Trump Presidency. To consume what is left of his time with the why/how/who assign blame to him for letting it happen and have him quit or impeach him for dereliction of duties or some other crime.

Think about it. Nothing they have tried has put a dent in him. Have you ever seen such a coordinated non stop attack of a President. Have you ever seen a political party so blatantly ,against the voters wishes, fight its own electorate. If the election was held today he would win bigger than before because everybody gets it now.

He has started the decoupling of the wall street economy and actively promotes home grown manufacturing. He did this by leaving the Paris accord, throwing out TPP and is this close to scrapping nafta. The CoC for the first time ever just openly came out against Trump renegotiating Nafta the American Job killer.

The economy has grown faster in his first two quarters than at any time in all of Obamas presidency over 3.2% in the last quarter. This was accomplished with almost no effort in direct contrast to what we have been told for thirty years about globalization.

The global warming gangsters have been thrown out on their ass. All TPP and Paris are about is the government sanctioned stealing our money. Nothing else! Nafta is used to undercut our manufacturing by letting china and anyone else ship their government subsidized crap to Mexico or Canada and transported to us and sold under priced so our American products and companies go out of business. Sorry that’s all it does folks.

Now this is serious stuff people. I believe Trump knows what is going on in government. He knows about the traitors in government. Gen Mattis knows who the traitors in the military complex are. Trump wants to let the cat out of the bag in a very public and very clear way so even the most uninformed can see what has really been going on for the last 40 years. How you have been sold out. You ever wonder how after 911 we have more muslim brother hood people in our government than ever. Research the U.S. v Holy land Foundation if you don’t believe me. Educate yourself.

I know most people don’t want to believe the government is that corrupt that compromised but it is folks. I believe when the truth comes out the nation will be stunned. People ,big people, will go to jail or mysteriously drop dead.

You know in your gut none of the Vegas story line makes sense for one guy. Now that we know the Mandalay Bay security guard was shot 10 mins before the massacre started there is a crack in the damn. This guy, Paddock, is part of a team that was supposed take part in the turkey shoot. The plan was to kill thousands. That’s why he had 23 guns in the room, several shooting platforms multiple thousands of rounds of ammo. That’s why the door to the room was not locked, he was expecting his team not the security guard. He panicked and started shooting early before the triangulation team was in place. That’s why every time his brother does an interview you know he is lying through his teeth.

You know why you hear about people who were shot behind the stage running away from the hotel because they where hit by the shooters in the towers behind the stage and across the street. you know why you here people calling 911 about shooters at other casinos because that’s how you delay the police response. Overwhelm them with locations. You know why the LVMPD looks pissed off in tonight’s press conference because they know they are being used and lied to by the FBI. Did you also know that FBI office in Vegas is not in charge of the investigation but the DC branch is.

Now this may upset some of you but use your brain. Think!

Framing is also going to be your best defense against this.

you never know how people will respond to this sort of thing until they're put to the test. the mandalay bay resort likely didn't have staff who'd prepared for this contingency, and so this doesn't really surprise me. even if the police had done drills/prepared for an attack of this nature, i sincerely doubt that they'd prepared for an attack on *this* scale

i really dislike this headline, because it seems to presuppose that the LVMPD had a delayed/inadequate response- when, although it's pretty clear that paddock intended to do a significant amount more damage and even possibly escape his room after carrying out this particular attack, the guard and the police at the *very least* convinced him that he was cornered and that suicide was the only way out within about 10 minutes

at this point, you're basically saying ""they could have been faster-"" when the time between his first shot and when he shot himself in the mouth was ~10 minutes later. *come on*

they're police and hotel staff- not superman

&gt;*Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Monday that gunman Stephen Paddock shot and wounded a Mandalay Bay hotel security guard outside his hotel room door and sprayed 200 bullets down the hall six minutes before he opened fire Oct. 1 from his high-rise suite on a crowd at a country music festival below*, i would say that

it's likely that the security guard thought it important to continue to engage the shooter rather than get to a safe place and potentially further endanger the rest of the 32^nd floor by requesting support and backup from local police. *even if* this is 100% correct (what they've put in this tiny article), all it really changes is the total time between *when he was ready to carry out the attack* and *when he shot himself in the mouth* to 16 minutes instead of 10

Strong argument.

&gt;We know the risks. 

Who is ""we"". Ever hear of 'When Genius Failed'? If anything else it's a great moral lesson. But that could never happen again because we know the risks... right?

&gt;""Catastrophic loss"" requires a Great Depression like-event.

Perhaps you and the JPM quant have different opinions on what constitutes a catastrophic loss. You seem to be implying that anything short of a 1929 style crash would not bring about catastrophic losses. I would highly disagree with that notion.

&gt;Do I need to spell that out? Fine you're skeptical but channel that and do your DD. Being skeptical for years means you're very wrong.

People who lack skepticism rarely survive markets in the long run. I don't know of any traders that haven't been skeptical in recent years. But there's a reason that I said committing to a full blown short strategy is probably a good way to lose your shirt. Being skeptical is one thing and is necessary imo. Thinking that you know more than the market however, and going all out short/long, at all-time highs is dangerous.

This market is irrational and could remain so for many years to come. That possibly though will not dissuade me from my skepticism if all remains the same.

Has there actually been a change in the rules that has enabled this?  I admit, I do not know terribly much about shorting and hedge funds, but isn't it a potentially disastrous, destabilizing the market - 

Yes, it is wonderful to figure out a formula for ""predicting"" a scenario where you can make money - but isn't OUR system supposed to not reward criminal behavior - if you engineer riots, anarchy, chaos in order to destabilize an entity, a neighborhood, a nation so that you can reap the benefits, that is not kosher.

Wouldn't it be like destroying a beautiful little neighborhood at least enough to bring down the prices so that you can come in and scoop up all the ""deals"" and THEN bring up the property again but making it inaccessible to the people that once lived there?  If you manage to vandalize the neighborhood so that you can make a bunch of money by ultimately controlling that piece of real estate, that seems wrong to me - maybe he thinks Americans are a bunch of rubes, ripe for the picking because we aren't even protecting ourselves against that kind of thinking.

Soros reminds me of that character, Potter, in ""It's A Wonderful Life"" - Jimmy Stewart's character, George Bailey, did battle with him and during the early days of the Depression when a bank run seemed to be forming on ""the good old savings and loan"" - George managed to convince his depositors to stick with him, not to go over to Potter's bank - ""folks . . . Potter's not SELLING, he's BUYING. ""

Soros may sell at various points along the way as his ""formula for success"" dictates, but it is with the ultimate goal of being able to buy - and control whatever it is that he has set his sights on.

D.A.K. refers to an apocalyptic prophecy spread on 4chan that something catastrophic and possibly Nazi-related would happen on October 16th, 2016.
Origin

The origin of the D.A.K. 16-10-16 prophecy are unknown, as early threads referencing it have been deleted. Also, the meaning is a point of debate among 4chan users.[1] D.A.K. is understood to be a German acronym, but it is unclear what the letters stand for. The most popular theories of what it could stand for are “Das Armageddon Kommt” (The Armageddon Comes), or Deutsch Afrikakorps, referring to the German expeditionary force sent to Africa at the start of World War II.[2]

As for the date, 4chan users have theorized that 16-10-16 refers to an apocalyptic section of the Bible from the Book of Revelations that reads:",http   knowyourmeme com memes d a k D A K  refers to an apocalyptic prophecy spread on 4chan that something catastrophic and possibly Nazi related would happen on October 16th  2016  Origin The origin of the D A K  16 10 16 prophecy,,Keetex NA,httpknowyourmemecommemesdakDAKreferstoanapocalypticprophecyspreadon4chanthatsomethingcatastrophicandpossiblyNazirelatedwouldhappenonOctober16th2016OriginTheoriginoftheDAK161016prophecy,3298.815,4937.403

Not to mention the fact that the military and even police need a well equipped a d compliant civilian support group to function for more than a month or so.

You think truck drivers, factory workers, utility workers, medical and fire personnel, sewage, and all sorts of factory workers are going to show up and deliv everything from gas to food to medicine to bullets when their family members are getting drone in a Walmart parking lot or shepherded into a stadium as a pow?

One or more group of kids getting droned or exploded by artillery during football practice is in small town America is all it would take for whatever militia movement to go from being seen as a group of loonies to a full blown insurrection.

For any soldiers out there who might think about joining with gun grabbers, just remember that gibes aren't the only thing that kills.  The food delivered weekly to army bases would quickly be a dangerous gamble, so would the water and meds.  So would that tracker trailer delivering fuel for your drones and aircraft, especially if you just killed the drivers family.  Fertilizer is cheap and plentiful at co-ops and very small town has one.  Hell, plenty of miners and others know about and have access to explosives.

So like all religious people, you're pulling 'facts' out of thin air ""its not up to you to determine..."". You can't just make shit up in the middle of the argument.
For arguments sake I'm gonna go with what you said.


What you are saying is that God simply doesn't think its time to come and help the world, even though this is pretty much a perfect time given that people are blowing up in the streets, slaughtering civlians and like you said children are being bombed in syria.

As for your point about what makes this 5 year old different than any other in Syria, that isn't really a point against me is it? What your saying is that God doesn't care for pretty much any humans, he's perfectly happy to see them get blown up when they aren't even old enough to be indoctrinated with the religious bullshit yet.


You seem to have a pretty self damaging view of God, quite sad really. Being an atheist is much easier not being scared of the 'eternal flames' of hell or 'judgement day' where Jesus will somehow manage to fly down with some weird ass powers and judge us all.



Also i'm not close minded, I simply use logic and my brain to determine that religion is clearly all bullshit. Christianity doesn't really help itself given that the Bible is full of contradictions which baits itself out as one of the shittiest books in existence.

The City of Dallas, Texas, passed an ordinance stating that
if a driver is pulled over by law enforcement and is not able to provide
proof of insurance , the car is towed .
 
To retrieve the car after being impounded,
they must show proof of insurance to have the car released.
This has made it easy for the City of Dallas to remove uninsured cars.
 
 
Shortly after the ""No Insurance"" ordinance was passed,
the Dallas impound lots began to fill up and were full after only nine days.
 
Over 80% of the impounded cars were driven by illegals .
 
Now, not only must they provide proof of insurance to have their car released,
they have to pay for the cost of the tow , 
a $350 fine ,
and $20 for every day their car is kept in the lot.
 
Guess what?
 
Accident rates have gone down47%
and Dallas' solution gets uninsured drivers off the road WITHOUT
making them show proof of nationality.
 
I wonder how the
Democrats will get around this one .

2577,54027,dphnhqy,RikyStew,The_Donald,Sutherland Springs church shooting,1510086141,"I just posted a wall of text in a YT comment on this very question. I am gonna copy and paste.
     
You ask how we amend societal views. My first reaction to such a question is to dis-allow all non-theists from public office; full well knowing there are atheists, agnostics and others who have been, are and will be more moral than I have been. However, even within ""pious"" peoples there exists fractures and discontent for brothers and sisters. I can see how my knee-jerk reaction would not be so different from today or from Europe 200 years ago which prompted the famous ""separation of church and state"" statement. So, my studied opinion would be to discontinue all forms of government subsidy. This includes of schools, businesses, farms, victims of natural tragedy, and all forms of tax breaks for selected individuals and groups. For further reading on this I suggest reading a short story called ""Not Yours to Give"". It is about Representative Davy Crockett voting to give money to a widow of serviceman: fee.org/resources/not-your-to-give-2/. Step 2 would be to abandon the Federal Reserve and return to sound money and a gold standard. This stops the easy money policies that are the payout method for so much greed as can be generated and lowers the power of the ""power brokers"" in the banking industry. (BTW, the Federal Reserve is a private bank that does not release it's list of shareholders. It is as Federal as Federal Express) Step 3 would be to have differing levels of citizenship. Only ""Full Citizens"" (or some other classification) can vote in Federal elections. States can make their own rules. To be allowed to become a full citizen you must offer your life as a service to the freedoms we all hold dear. Many countries around the world require 18-24 months of conscription by all citizens who are capable. This fulfills our need for a ""regulated"" militia (able-bodied citizens from 15-45) with the proper training and skills to come to the needs of our nation. You will need to serve a minimum of 18 months with a commendation of quality service at the commencement of 18 months to be granted full citizenship. Obviously not everyone needs to be front-line combat soldiers. Doctors, analysts and staff personnel of multiple levels and abilities are invaluable in any military. For those unable or unwilling to serve, other levels of legal residence and citizenship should follow, but only those with Full Citizenship should vote. This will invariable leave some people out. Conscientious objectors will be free to pursue other levels of citizenship and have all the rights of a free individual except voting Federally. If you choose to live under the blanket of our protection, do not believe you have a say in how that blanket is made unless you helped make it. People may gather around a poker table and watch the game, but they have no say in the dealing of cards without FIRST putting up an ante. The skeleton above requires a HUGE (YUGE?) amount of flesh, but it is where I would start if I were magically ""in-charge"".

Sorry for the wall of text, but this is a subject I have given considerable study and time to and have ages more of info (opinion) to give. I will end my soap box by spreading one more message. Read everything you can by Frederic Bastiat. I suggest ""The Law"" (bastiat.org/en/the_law.html), ""That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen"" (bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html) and ""Petition of Candlestickmakers"" (bastiat.org/en/petition.html).

Doesn't seem plausible to me that an organized crime syndicate would recruit the neighbor of a politician and have the neighbor attack him in broad daylight.  If you were conspiring to assault a person while he mowed his lawn, wouldn't you get somebody less identifiable to do the deed?

Her information has SOME value, though-- you've just got to carefully corroborate all of it with other sources and other things we know to be true. 

I read everything that the opposition writes to learn everything I can about them, so I'm reading her book now. She gives very specific examples of Clinton/DNC fuckups in her book. Many of these things can be verified. For example, we first learned about the DNC/Clinton financing structure from her book-- she specifically writes about the contract between the Clinton campaign and the DNC, the Clinton's use of the Victory fund before the general election, etc. Wikileaks has already published the contract which validated everything she said on this. 

There are many other things in the book which would be difficult / impossible to verify, and are obviously self-serving-- particularly how she paints herself as not wanting the interim chair role. She is exhaustive on this point and really overdoes it. I don't believe her. 

I do believe her on the point of Obama and DWS causing financial problems at the DNC-- Obama by ignoring it, and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz by having monthly expenditures at about 2X where they should have been. We already know that Obama thought the DNC was a bunch of incompetent idiots, so he pushed them to the side and ran everything through the white house and PACs.

 I'd say also that this is one of the problems with being a feminist. If you view yourself as an honorary man, you're always going to push yourself to behave the way YOU THINK a man would.

I've seen this in a lot of feminist women. They want to 'kick ass' and be 'tough' and be 'strong'. Of course, they hate chivalry and any little niceties men might do for women.

Which basically translates to them needlessly enduring pain and suffering because they think that's what strong women do. 

They think being 'tough' means just sitting there and taking whatever crap someone dishes out to them without ever just saying no and walking away.

This lady probably wanted to be tough and a badass and maybe 'face her fears' and what not. But in the process, she did what most feminists end up doing: just take endless amounts of crap from some asshole than she otherwise needed to.

She probably thinks getting up and walking away would be weak because she thinks a man would not get up and walk away. He'd just sit there and 'face his fears'. She has no concept of her own vulnerability or her own strength. If Putin did not have his dog out but instead opened doors for her, she would likely hate him even more. 

This is what happens when globalists dictate the terms for how 'strong, independent women' should behave: the women end up being tools with no sense of their own perceptions and try to clone what THEY THINK male behavior WOULD be, to their own massive detriment.",Exactly  You nailed it  I d say also that this is one of the problems with being a feminist  If you view yourself as an honorary man  you re always going to,14.0,DrMBison 14,ExactlyYounaileditIdsayalsothatthisisoneoftheproblemswithbeingafeministIfyouviewyourselfasanhonorarymanyourealwaysgoingto,1596.287,2037.609

This women has made a career of being a professional SJW and inventing terms about the limitless opportunities for white able bodied men.

She then goes to deny answering a question about a topic that contradicts her position and calls a request to play devils advocate a ""power move"". 

So what we have is someone who claims to be an academic, spreading falsehoods and misinformation on topics that shouldn't even be on any university campus, who would be unwilling to even debate her topics. So she isn't even interested in actual discussion with students, just wants to preach to a bunch of young minds who won't challenge her position.

&gt;89. The President and Ms. Lewinsky had ten sexual encounters that included direct contact with the genitalia of at least one party, and two other encounters that included kissing. On nine of the ten occasions, Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex on the President. On nine occasions, the President touched and kissed Ms. Lewinsky’s bare breasts. On four occasions, the President also touched her genitalia. On one occasion, the President inserted a cigar into her vagina to stimulate her. The President and Ms. Lewinsky also had phone sex on at least fifteen occasions. 

Footnote 97, Nine orgasms for Bill, Three for Monica. Worse than the “pay gap”!

&gt;97. She testified that she had orgasms on three of the four occasions. We note that fact because (i) the definition referred to direct contact with the genitalia with the “intent to arouse or gratify” and (ii) the President has denied such contact. Ms. Lewinsky also testified that on one occasion, the President put his hand over her mouth during a sexual encounter to keep her quiet. Lewinsky 7/31/98 Int. at 3.

I’ve precepted in a nursing home as part of my nursing program curriculum and the patient load is absolutely nuts (25-30 patients per LPN)  but to walk into a patient’s room and laugh as he gasps for air? Then watch as the man dies?!?! Unbelievable. It’s unfortunate that the shortage of nurses and the patient load is what likely kept good nurses away from this place and allowed these two piles of shit to thrive just because they took the job. The patient load alone can allow things to slip through the cracks though, not that I’m defending these two, but during my preceptorship I literally passed out meds from 7 am til 5 pm. There was no time to stop between except for a 30 minute lunch and when you’re constantly handing out meds and checking that they’re the right ones for each patient you literally don’t have time to check for skin breakdown or secondary issues. Of course not being able to breathe is a different story and should illicit an immediate response, but things as simple as a fall can cause morbidity in the elderly within a few days. I just can’t fathom watching as someone dies without doing any intervention at all and even laughing at it. Maybe they’re burnt out but that doesn’t absolve them from what I would say is criminal negligence. They should be stripped of their licenses and jailed at the very least. 


This may be a little anecdotal, but thankfully in my experience these two nurses are exceptions rather than the rule. The facility I precepted at had a patient pass away and the staff that cared for them were visibly distraught. They prayed together and a few cried.

However, the Old Testament Law, which most people would call barbaric or savage, was completed in full when Christ came, died on the cross, and rose again.

God created the Law not to be fulfilled by man, but to illustrate to man how futile it was to attempt perfection and holiness. Our sin had permanently separated us from Him, and nothing we could do could fix that. That is why Christ's sacrifice is so important to Christians.

So Christians are no longer bound by the laws set forth in the Old Testament, but by the new covenant created between mankind and God by His Son Jesus.

All of that to say we believe our bible is the literal word of God, but our Bible doesn't say to kill infidels or that it's okay to marry children or rape women as punishment for having been raped.

Just curious; why do you say ""us"" if you literally  hardly ever post here at T_D (about 3 times in about 2 yrs) but, when you did post, it was always to point out something negative being just discrete enough not to be obviously anti-Trump or anti whatever point is being made?

Now, for example, you posted to point out that whites do commit most mass murders. In March 2016 to point out (as if asking) that ""Trump Steaks"" went ""out of business after a last ditch effort on QVC"". Also in 2016, when Trump was angry that people in CO didn't get to vote in the primaries, you posted to point out that it was a Republican decision - which is true - but I think you were more interested in pointing out that Trump had no right to complain of a Republican decision and that his own party did all they could to stop him, than to show any outrage at such Republican decision.

At least with this acct, it doesn't seem as if you post in anti-Trump subs, but your post history definitely doesn't show you to be a Trump supporter or one of ""us"".

It would be nice if you had in fact become a Trump supporter, but I just don't see any evidence of that in this post here and the other two comments you posted here in the last couple of years.

Are you a conservative or even right leaning at all?

Are you a Trump supporter? 

If you're not a Trump supporter and want to post here being respectful, that can be fine.

I grew up in a ""diverse"" neighborhood during the 90's in a certain liberal state. Blacks and Browns were damn near at war with each other.

- Overpowering a teacher isn't something likely to happen quickly and silently. It adds one more risky step for any potential shooter, and there's a pretty big opportunity for other students to intervene during that time.
- Assuming a potential shooter does manage to overpower a teacher without being noticed/subdued, now they've got maybe 20 rounds and a compact handgun.

All attacks have an asymmetric effect in that people not directly associated with the attack change behaviour based on it. A terrorist attack can affect a city in another part of the country. A mass shooting also does this but to a lesser degree. A dog attack really only effects the immediate community.

So of course you deal with terrorist attacks and networks because the efficacy of an attack on the populace is high even though you have a low chance of being killed in the attack. You don't need a lot of attacks to have a large reaction. It's a natural protection mechanism. Terrorism is a threat to the stability of the whole society and it breaks down the bonds and hardens the reaction between people in that society. You also don't need a lot of terrorists. 

The liberal argument is that we need to do something about mass shootings, which I agree with. But they propose that we should ban the means of allowing a mass shooter to shoot and that that will somehow stop them killing. In theory yes it will have an impact on the method but not the motivation. 9/11 shows what happens when men are motivated but need to find means. They do not propose going after the motivation or the causes of the ideation of that motivation. Because to do so would cast a dark shadow on their ideals about how society functions.

Banning guns will also have unintended and bad consequences as was so well captured in the 2nd Amendment. The cost of overreaction is much dearer than the cost of dealing with the grief at a shooting incident. 

So to say that since the chance to get killed in a mass shooting is the same as the chance of being killed in a dog attack, and why aren't we banning dogs, is to miss the point about impact. It's too simple an argument.",The real meat of the argument is impact  Nicholas Nassem Taleb talks about this in Antifragile and it is a very good way of stating it  All attacks have an,21.0,EdmondDaunts 21,TherealmeatoftheargumentisimpactNicholasNassemTalebtalksaboutthisinAntifragileanditisaverygoodwayofstatingitAllattackshavean,1224.027,1250.484

Liberalism **is** a mental illness. .. watching the cnn town hall was the best thing I’ve done this year since it reminded me of the religious fervor they work their base into and mindlessly attach a preconceived notion or outcome in their heads as the only possible solution. 

The killer was let go by the FBI, the Fucking Broward county sheriffs dept, the school counselor, multiple failures. . . But hey “Marco Rubio, will you state here tonight that you will not accept money from the NRA?” Are you kidding me?

I wonder why the Las Vegas shooting or the shooting involving the republican senators at the baseball field didn’t come up at the town hall . . Oh right, because both of those appear to have also been due to fantastically corrupt democratic practices.

3019,925,7zwh75,BrutalTruth101,The_Donald,Stoneman Douglas High School shooting,1519477676,"While Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold casually murdered classmates in the Columbine High library, at least six Jefferson County sheriff's deputies waited outside the school for help.

Two of those deputies already had traded gunfire with the killers in the opening moments of the attack. But by the time the first SWAT team trailed Harris and Klebold inside Columbine, the worst school shooting in U.S. history already was over.

According to a vast crime report released Monday by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, a disturbingly swift and vicious crime was followed by a methodical police response.

Harris and Klebold took only 16 minutes to kill 13 people and wound 21 others. Police took three hours and 14 minutes to find them.

The report says deputies did the best they could on April 20, 1999, under extremely difficult circumstances.

""Upon receiving a briefing about the law enforcement response to this horrible crime, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno commented that these professionals had ""shown the nation and the world America's finest in crisis,'- "" said the report signed by Sheriff John Stone and Undersheriff John Dunaway. ""We agree, and wish to express our deep appreciation for their assistance."" In the chaos of the crime scene, sheriff's deputies heard dozens of conflicting reports about the killers' identities and locations. While bombs detonated, alarms blared and hundreds of students ran for their lives, police struggled to coordinate a rescue.

A supposed sniper on the school roof turned out to be a air-duct repairman. There also were false reports of 17 hostages in an auditorium, six to eight heavily armed gunmen in body armor and shooters in a science room.

The report said such conflicting information hurt the department's ability to quickly rescue students.

Among the report's findings:

- Sheriff's 911 dispatchers heard teacher Patti Nielson plead for help in the school library from 11:29 to 11:36 a.m., but no police rescuers arrived until 3:22 p.m. That means that the li brary, where 10 students were murdered and 12 wounded in those 7 1/2 minutes, was ""the last area to be checked"" by SWAT rescuers.

- After dispatchers heard for hours how teacher Dave Sanders was severely wounded and being treated by two Eagle Scouts in a science room, a SWAT team finally reached him at 2:40 p.m. While Sanders continued to bleed, two SWAT officers waited ""20 to 30 minutes"" for paramedics to arrive. By then, he was dead.

- The first SWAT team commander on the scene did not know that a major school renovation had moved the library and cafeteria, sites of the most mayhem, to a new location on the opposite end of the building. As a result, the first SWAT team entered Columbine from the far side of the school and never encountered Harris or Klebold.

More than a year after the crime, a judge ordered Jefferson County to release the crime report Monday. Contained on a single CD-ROM disc with dozens of hyperlinks, the report would have spanned 700 pages if it were a paper document.

Sheriff's officials declined to comment on the report because the case is the subject of so much litigation. Fifteen families of Columbine victims and survivors have sued the county over its response.

""There aren't a lot of high expectations on this report,"" said Sam Riddle, spokesman for the family of slain student Isaiah Shoels. ""The Shoels family feels strongly that there needs to be an unbiased investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, not by someone with a vested interest in protecting his political green stamps."" According to the sheriff's report, Harris and Klebold fired their first shots outside Columbine at 11:19 a.m. and killed their last victim inside the library at 11:35 a.m.

Harris killed Kelly Fleming, Steve Curnow, Cassie Bernall, Isaiah Shoels and Daniel Mauser, the report said, while Klebold killed Daniel Rohrbough, Kyle Velasquez, Matt Kechter and John Tomlin.


A spray of bullets and shotgun pellets from both Harris and Klebold was reported to have killed Corey DePooter, Rachel Scott, Lauren Townsend and teacher Dave Sanders.
The sheriff's report concluded that Harris and Klebold had not planned to shoot classmates studying in the school library. They expected to shoot fleeing students after a devastating pair of homemade propane bombs blew up the school cafeteria.
But their bombs, placed in the cafeteria just before lunchtime, failed to explode. Harris and Klebold sat in the parking lot, waiting. At 11:19 a.m. they stopped waiting.

""Go, go,"" the killers shouted outside the school as they opened fire on classmates outside the cafeteria during a lunch hour.

Within seven minutes of the first shots, two deputies had traded gunfire with Harris. The first was Neil Gardner, the school resource officer. Responding to a ""female down"" call, he spotted Harris at the school doors. At 11:24 a.m., Harris emptied his 10-round rifle at the deputy, striking two nearby police cars. Gardner returned four shots before Harris disappeared into the school.

Two minutes later a second deputy was locked in a gunfight with Harris. Paul Smoker, who had been writing a speeding ticket nearby when the 911 call came, found Harris shooting at him from a broken window in a set of double doors to the school. Smoker fired three rounds before Harris disappeared again.

By 11:30 a.m., there were four other deputies at the school. Scott Taborsky had arrived to help Smoker tend to wounded students. Paul Magor had set up a roadblock to the school. Rick Searle had joined the rescue effort, tending to students behind the cover of Taborsky's patrol car. Kevin Walker was stationed outside the cafeteria, ready to rescue or cover for escaping students.

Steve Davis, a spokesman for the sheriff's department, declined to say why none of those officers entered the high school, calling that issue beyond the scope of the report.

At 11:29 a.m., the gunmen walked into the library, where 56 people had taken refuge. In the next 7 1/2 minutes, they killed 10 people and wounded 12 others.

Their last victim was shot one minute before the first SWAT team leader, Lt. Terry Manwaring, arrived and set up a command post.

Manwaring led the SWAT response into what seemed a war zone with a rough sketch of the school interior. He mistakenly believed the cafeteria was on the east side of the school. It along with the library had been relocated four years earlier to the west side.

At 12:06 p.m., the first SWAT team entered the east side of Columbine.

Harris and Klebold had spent the previous half-hour wandering from the library to the cafeteria below, where they repeatedly tried to set off the giant propane bomb that failed earlier. At 12:05 p.m., they exchanged gunfire one last time through the library windows with police outside. Then they lit a Molotov cocktail, put guns to their heads and, by 12:08 p.m., killed themselves.

Police didn't know the killers had committed suicide, in part because a 911 dispatcher had disconnected a live phone line inside the library.

While panicking students fled the school, SWAT teams methodically searched classrooms. At 2:40 p.m, more than three hours after teacher Dave Sanders was shot while evacuating students, a SWAT team found two Eagle Scouts, Aaron Hancy and Kevin Starkey, trying to save the teacher's life with first aid.

Earlier, another teacher had held up a sign in the classroom window: ""1 bleeding to death."" Though the two Scouts were ""reluctant to leave the teacher behind,"" a SWAT officer took the teens from the school, the report says. Sanders died while two other SWAT officers waited for a paramedic.

A lawyer for Sanders' daughter Angela said he was dismayed by the police response to the dying teacher.

""What is so disturbing is that they consciously decided to leave Dave Sanders there, bleeding to death, notwithstanding a myriad, a multiple different ways to rescue him, including SWAT teams going in through any of one of the 25 exterior entrances or including going through the glass through the window,"" said lawyer Peter Grenier.

The overall attack left the Columbine building and grounds riddled with spent bullets and shotgun shells. Harris fired 121 rounds, 96 from his short-barreled rifle, 25 with a sawed-off shotgun. Klebold fired 67 times, 55 with a TEC-DC9 assault pistol, 12 with another sawed-off shotgun.
Twelve law enforcement officers from Jefferson County, Denver and Lakewood fired a total of 141 rounds. All but 20 were fired by Denver police.

According to the report, nobody was killed or wounded by police fire. That finding contradicts a claim by Daniel Rohrbough's family, who filed a lawsuit against Jefferson County claiming that law enforcement agents killed their son.

The official report confirmed previous accounts that Klebold and Harris seemed to enjoy themselves.

As the killing began, witnesses heard one of the gunmen shout, ""This is what we always wanted to do. This is awesome!"" Other witnesses reported hearing them laugh as they fired.

""While this report establishes a record of the events of April 20, it cannot answer the most fundamental question - WHY?"" the sheriff's report states. ""That is, why would two young men, in the spring of their lives, choose to murder faculty members and classmates? The evidence provides no definitive explanation, and the question continues to haunt us all.""",While Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold casually murdered classmates in the Columbine High library  at least six Jefferson County sheriff s deputies waited outside the school for help  Two of those,21.0,BrutalTruth101 21,WhileEricHarrisandDylanKleboldcasuallymurderedclassmatesintheColumbineHighlibraryatleastsixJeffersonCountysheriffsdeputieswaitedoutsidetheschoolforhelpTwoofthose,4085.339,8019.962

It appears the project was focused on the potential competition in the space industry. Remember this is immediately after our own space programs (NASA) were cut heavily. Then this research project cites increased competition in space as a threat to national security?

It appears this was a way to obtain fisa warrants for ANY developed nation with some type of space program, including Halper’s assignment of the “Russian-China” relationship. Great Britain is also a focus of the project, which would explain the recurring importance of Britain in the Russian investigation.

When reached for comment, a Senior Editor at the *Times* played up the newspaper's penchant for delivering hard-hitting 'journalism' that helps shape American policy - not just in the US, but across the globe: 

""What a day! In the past, *The New York Times* - in coordination with communist subversives in the US State Department - helped the Chinese communist party kill the Chinese nationalist party during and after the events of World War II. We are distinctly proud that this led to the rise of Mao and the slaughter and starvation of countless millions in China. As history is clear, communism is clearly the answer for utopia. 

Well today, we're pleased that America is finally turning a corner on it's troubled, divisive, unequal past. Seeing a former Secretary of State openly calling for America's Death is the type of societal discourse we strive to provide here at the *Times*. We readily support - and will do so with leading editorials and misleading headlines while burying the lede - former Sec State Kerry's stunning vision of America's future - Death - along with our close allies in the DPRK and Iran.""

there is a reason that they want Universal background checks ... it is something they need in place in order to when they have full control to pass a gun confiscation...

Extended background checks don't do anything to curtail violence due to mental illness, nor do they find anything when dealing with religious extremism. For example, look at how Tashfeen Malik slipped through ALL of her background checks for entry into the country, **which is under higher scrutiny than a firearms background check**. Add to that, any kind of purchase delay just means law abiding citizens have to wait even more to get their purchase. If someone wants to commit crimes with firearms, and they cannot get them legally, they WILL get them illegally. So nothing, legislative wise, will keep guns out of the hands of those that 100% disregard the rule of law. THEY DON'T CARE! And new legislation will not stop them.

I'm not ok with adding more laws that will make it further restrictive to law abiding citizens, when the checkpoints we already have in place are not being enforced. (Repetitive, yes. Required, I think so...)

That's like saying we need new immigration laws with harsher penalties for illegal immigration, when we don't even enforce the punishments that are already established. (Looking at the asinine ""Sanctuary Cities"" debacle.)

There are more deaths per year due to knives, due to baseball bats, due to simple melee implemented weapons than there are due to firearms, and mass shootings. Should we make new legislation requiring further obstruction to the purchase of those items?

Laws are a deterrent, not a prevention. And if the deterrent is not heeded, making more deterrents will accomplish nothing.

Let's talk prevention. Let's remove the stigma from mental health. Let's remove the stigma from discussing Religious Radicalism. Let's get these things out in the open, and visible before hand. Maybe that would help stop this kind of crap.

Let's remove ""Gun Free Zones"". All that does is DETER law abiding citizens. It does not PREVENT law breaking murderers. Let's embrace, and educate our country's self defensive history. Let's make it common education for everyone on how to wield, and properly maintain firearms. Let's remove the fear of guns, period. (Looking at Switzerland for example.)

3369,1,3vmq4u,Tropic33,Conservative,San Bernardino attack,1449380569,"&gt; True. But here's the thing (BTW, I'm from Europe and used to be very much anti-gun until I moved to rural America): I often hear the U.S. gun problem compared to that of other countries, as if it were realistic to implement for instance Australia's or the U.K.'s gun control or ban approaches.
The island thing isn't even the reason why it worked there - although it does help. France's gun control laws used to work until the Soviet Bloc fell. Then Schengen's agreement was implemented and extended to Eastern European countries. Nowadays you can find AKs for 300 euros on the black market in Western Europe.
But to get back to the U.S.: low estimates place the number of firearms at 300 million. In reality, it's probably well over a a billion. Just let that sink in for a minute. And every time a major call is made by some politicians or pundits for stricter gun control, gun and ammo sales shoot up - because gun owners want to acquire those now, before it's too late (they've been had before in some states for some restrictions). There's a joke that Obama has been America's best gun salesman for 7 years in a row. That's because the NRA has been trumpeting before he even got elected that he would push for strict gun control (he really hasn't done anything in that field, but many Congress Democrats - and many state representatives and senators) have been doing just that. So forget about a ban or a buy back. The U.S. couldn't fund it even if it were otherwise possible.
It's absolutely unrealistic to demand a ban or disarmament like Australia's or the U.K.'s in the U.S. It will never happen. Ever.
First of all, there is the interpretation of the Second Amendment every SCOTUS majority has subscribed to. And the Heller and MacDonald decisions have hammered it in. It's unlikely even an anti-gun majority in SCOTUS will challenge the stare decisis.
It's also political. And every stupid gun control measure ever passed has confirmed for gun owners and gun rights activitists that they must fight every attempt at gun control. Why? Because 99% of all gun control laws are completely inefficient at curbing crime. All they do is burden law-abiding citizens who never shoot at anything else but paper with bullshit paperwork, stupid restrictions and inane situations. Measures that have zero impact on criminal elements as demonstrated with the San Bernardino terrorists. They violated countless California and federal gun laws. So gun owners feel the same way about those gun control laws like the ones Newsom is pushing in California like Porsche drivers would feel if tomorrow the government told them they have to turn in their cars because speed kills, or install equipment to prevent them to drive over 80 mph, and present ID everytime they buy gas. Because none of them has killed anyone, nor intend to kill anyone.
You know how you feel about those insane TSA restrictions at the airport? The no-liquid-above-3-ounces rule, the removing the shoe part, the chronic incompetence demonstrated by many of those employees who look like they ended up there because they failed the DMV personnel exam? That's how many gun owners feel about the government trying to restrict gun ownership. It's all a big show that does nothing really to prevent terrorism or criminals to commit crimes. It just burdens citizens with bullshit, encumbering their privacy and right to travel. It's all theater.
Finally, it's cultural. Where I live, when my ex a few years ago called the cops, they took 45 minutes to show up - it's very rural, and especially at night, there's only so much real estate each cop can cover. Do I really want laws that restrict the number of rounds my guns can hold, or prevent me from buying a pump action shotgun? Hell no. Where I live, it's the Wild West.
Don't be an elitist asshole who tells me to move. Not everyone can afford living in a nice little neighborhood. I like the country, and I'm willing to take my chances with metheads, as long as I can keep a gun nearby.
One more thing - and that one is essential to understand the reluctance of many gun owners to see additional gun control measures implemented: they simply do not trust the government to maintain reliable databases. And to their credit, many agencies - including that of state governments - are terrible at it. Remember how in 2000 Florida suppressed the votes of thousands of individuals simply because they had the same names as convicted felons? They don't trust the government to do this kind of thing, rightfully or not. They also don't like the government to keep tabs on what kind of guns they have, or how many they own. The NSA grab on citizens' privacy and communications has done a lot of harm, and many of those gun owners do not trust the government for all those reasons.

I personally think the bill would be beneficial, and would take Trump's side on this one (and this is not because I am already a Trump supporter, as I disagree with Trump on other things). While it's certainly possible that some innocent man may end up on the watchlist, you have to consider the fact that they had to have done *something* shady, correct? I feel like this could be manipulated though. Racial profiling, misunderstandings, and people googling ""how to get into ISIS"" or things along that vein, may all lead someone to be blacklisted. But we also have to consider the fact that many terror attacks may be stopped with this. So I think both sides have their points, but when it comes to practicality, and the fact that most innocent people like us *won't* lose a basic right (unlike some other proposals), and that I won't have to sacrifice some of my freedom, it feels like a good choice.

3430,90603,dzfn9th,Good_Behavior_Day,The_Donald,Santa Fe High School shooting,1527064988,"100 years ago you could buy guns through the Sears catalog.  Local militias were common, so every male property owner was expected to own a gun.   On the frontier, wild animals were enough of a problem that firearms were considered a necessity.  Now there's a five day waiting period and criminal background check for any gun.   The ""more guns than people"" argument is flawed; no one knows exactly how many guns are in the US, estimates range between 250 to 350 million.  Also, the guns aren't evenly distributed; a lot are in the hands of collectors who will never fire those guns.  You're not going to find 2 to 3 guns in every household, it's closer to half of all households have at least one gun.  The left went with the high estimate, and then framed the argument to create the impression that every random person has a gun laying around.     
         
With school shootings (or any shootings really), there's two types.  First is two people get into an argument, one of them goes and finds a gun, shoots the fellow who pissed him off, and then it's done.  This type is pretty common and has been going on since before the country was founded.   The second type is where someone decides they're pissed at everyone, arms themselves to the teeth, and then shoots as many as possible before being captured or committing suicide.  This type is rarer and Columbine is the first example of this happening.  At the time, people blamed video games and rock music.  Now it seems like we want to blame antidepressants.       
      
Fun fact, the top five school massacres in terms of fatalities occurred outside the US.  The top one for the US used dynamite to kill his victims.   
     
A while ago I made this [chart](https://i.imgur.com/QICGUO4.jpg).

Because that's their choice because they choose to be bad at managing money. 

&gt; 1/7 citizens rely on food banks

Because that's their choice not to get good experience to get a good job or a good degree worth something. 

I know what it's like to be poor, I grew up in poverty, was on welfare. And I chose to make better choices to have a more stable life. If one doesn't make better choices, life will eat you up and spit you right out. 

Almost all of the poor people I know that are still poor have one thing in common: They consistently make bad choices to stay poor. You don't choose to be born into poverty but you do choose to stay in it. 
And that's the dirty little insider secret of the poor. 

I'm not saying life is easy, it isn't. And it has gotten progressively worse over the past 40 years. 

1. As the minimum wage went up, jobs disappeared. I watched fast food crews shrink to 50% of what they were in 1986 to now. 
2. Salaries have been stagnant since about 2000 as cost of living and out of pocket expenses have gone up, up, up. 
3. Unions have demanded higher wages and so their jobs move overseas. But this is especially true for the UAW and AFL-CIO (see Delphi Automotive). Other unions have been more flexible so their workers manage to keep their jobs (like my uncle). 

People who are feeble-minded to begin with will never be able to deal with these changes, so the poor get poorer, and yes the rich get richer, one reason because they are flexible and can make difficult choices. But I'm not blaming rich people for my own choices, I make my own life.

If you want good advice, I'll help anyone who asks for free. But people can't realistically expect to be successful if they are too lazy to educate themselves or too selfish to make sacrifices.

I'm sure I'll get a lot of downvotes and hate from snowflakes, but votes are not the point. The point is I want to encourage people to take all that energy from whining, and use it to get things done and move in a positive direction.

The reason these people were successful at stopping these shooters was because they were mentally/morally fit to own a gun and also clearly knew how to handle one properly. People who want stricter regulations are only looking to make sure more of those people are getting guns and less people like James Holmes, and the two men mentioned in this thread are.

Most of the tech for ""assault weapons"" has been around for 100ish years. A typical assault weapons ban consists of a list, and if your firearm meets 2 or 3 of the things on the list, it becomes an assault weapon. But here's the thing, high capacity magazines are really old, dating back to sometime in the late 1800's. Another common restriction is having a barrel shroud, which is just a piece of material that protects your hand from a hot barrel.

&gt;But neither of those require weapons that fire 600 rounds per minute (unless you're a REALLY poor shot!)

No one with any political weight is fighting for fully automatic weapons right now. Fully automatic weapons were essentially outlawed in 1986, no new legislation is going to make them any harder to get.

&gt;I agree with you on RKBA not being just for self defense because there is, of course, hunting and recreation

Actually it wasn't until the 20th century that hunting and recreation entered into the 2A discussion. For a long time there was a legal requirement that for a gun to have 2A protection it needed to be a ""militia weapon"". This came to head in a case about a guy with a sawed off shotgun, the prosecution's argument was that it wouldn't be useful as a militia weapon, and thus wasn't protected.

Personally this the view of the 2A that I hold. I would trade ever right to hunt and every competitive shooting argument if it meant that weapons that had real militia value would have protected status.",First off  this poster  http   www reddit com r Republican comments x8xwj gun carrying man ends stabbing spree at salt lake c5kh05h  has it right  Most of the tech for  assault weapons  has been around for 100ish years  A typical assault weapons ban consists of a list  and,17.0,AtheistConservative 17,FirstoffthisposterhttpwwwredditcomrRepublicancommentsx8xwjguncarryingmanendsstabbingspreeatsaltlakec5kh05hhasitrightMostofthetechforassaultweaponshasbeenaroundfor100ishyearsAtypicalassaultweaponsbanconsistsofalistand,2080.455,3665.259

If you had the employees pay for their birth control out of pocket, aren't they still paying for it with the salary they earned through the company's revenue?  It seems like, in order to really be consistent with this idea, that paying for birth control is somehow against their religious beliefs, shouldn't they be having every employee sign a pledge saying they won't use birth control period?  And would you _really_ be as okay with that? Does that really feel like conserving freedom?

Moreover, we don't let Jehovah's Witnesses pay less income taxes, proportionate to defense spending. We don't let Hindus pay less taxes so they aren't paying for beef in school lunches.  We make people pay for things that go against their personal beliefs all the time. Which I think is huge in this debate.

Speaking of JWs, if a business was run by a Jehovah's Witness, would you be okay with them refusing to do any health insurance that allows blood transfusions?

I guess.. My larger point is, there are times in society where you just have to pay for things you aren't 100% okay with, and it isn't _really_ acting contrary to their religious beliefs, and it's the price you pay for getting access to all of the benefits that being part of society gets you.  

And I feel like incorporating your business into a separate, legal entity with protections granted by all taxpayers is more likely to be one of those times, since it means you have obligations to keep your religious beliefs cordoned off for that, since your personal life is no longer the company's life.  If you get all of the benefits of separating your corporate life from your personal life, why should you still get to push your personal, religious life onto more of your employees' lives.  Yes, there's no law that says your employees have to work for you, but there's also no law you have to incorporate your business either. 

And the $9 month thing clearly isn't really about 'not being able to afford it', and that's sort of a cruel argument.  The AMA says that birth control is important for a woman's health.  Also, what would the dollar amount be for things that are worth caring about? These are why I brought up the hypothetical thought-experiment religion about prilosec and lipitor, because, honestly, I don't think you'd be using the same argument if it was a prescription drug that was more likely to affect you.

Also, not being able to afford kids, I think, is a pretty valid reason to want to use birth control, not a reason it should be denied to you.

Maybe some liberals think that, sure. 

Many others think that the war on drugs should be shitcanned because it will remove the main source of funding from terrorists and organised crime, it will remove the incentive for the more ridiculous actions of the police (no-knock raids which result in deaths either of civilians or police, for instance), it will create a massive new revenue stream that will allow taxes on everything else to be lowered which will likely have a huge impact on the national debt, it will remove a massive amount of population pressure on prisons (instantly, were we to release every non-violent offender, or over time if we just stop jailing them).

Hell, it'll lower illegal immigration to the USA from Mexico (because the cartel violence is largely caused by the drug war). Everything that dropping the war on drugs would directly cause will have knock-on effects which are largely positive.

Sure, it being legal will mean that I won't have to buy from hippies who lace my shit with horse vomit, but isn't that a positive?

Roberts called it a tax, under the assumption that everyone would automatically be against it. At least a handful of conservatives were with him in that logic.

Hrm.  If he was calling it a tax so that everyone would be against it.. Why not just strike the law down?  I'm not sure I follow your thought here, and, certainly unfairly, I'm instinctively finding it a bit tin-foil-hattish. 

Here's what I was referring to, in terms of Roberts using the tax argument to uphold the ACA but limit precedent, relevant passage on page 2:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/randy-barnett-we-lost-on-health-care-but-the-constitution-won/2012/06/29/gJQAzJuJCW_story.html

&gt; With that said, ACA was passed as a tax, that mainly affects the middle class who doesn't have health insurance. It's a nice greater good project and a lot people won't be affected by it, as far as the tax is concerned, because they either have insurance already or they are poor enough to qualify for Medicare. It isn't unreasonable at all for some other utopian politician to propose a federal law that forces employers to subsidize education, food, housing, or any other 'need' or else face a tax. Something like that wouldn't be hard to pass, especially now that such a method of taxing is considered constitutional.

This I follow a lot better, and I'm swayed by it. I suppose the thinking is, those sorts of taxes are open to voter displeasure, and you could simply run out of office any utopian politician who did so.  

&gt;What it comes down to is either we want a quality healthcare system that can likely benefit most people, since hospitals/doctors should be competing with their prices. Or we want a mediocre or less healthcare system that is able to cover everyone, citizen or not, while maintain our running complaint of our bad healthcare system.

How would you reconcile that with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_systems#International_comparisons ?

&gt;I don't think poor people would just start dying, because there are charities, or hospital itself can decide to be charitable to lower incomes, especially for the majority of the ER visits.

Roberts called it a tax, under the assumption that everyone would automatically be against it. At least a handful of conservatives were with him in that logic. The problem with that assumption is their view of everyone is actually just most conservatives, and most conservatives were already against it to begin with. Most people don't see taxes the same way conservatives do, something that is a necessary evil that should be as low as possible to pay for basic services. It seems these people are either indifferent to or pro-tax hike because they either don't have to pay them (the bulk to the tax the rich crowd), it doesn't affect them (people like Buffett), or they like 'for the greater good' type' projects (pro-big government types).

I am a firm believer that anything the government creates false demand for, or is involved in, either gets locked down in bureaucracy or greatly loses quality. Hospitals have been bogged down in this system of perpetual welfare since that decision. The healthcare system in general has been inflated with false demand and the competitive playing field being leveled. The entitled ER visits are grossly abused by patients, who go there with no emergency, and by the hospitals themselves, who take advantage of the taxpayer by charging more/running unnecessary tests or procedures to fluff the cost. With the poorest citizens being subsidized by everyone else, there is no reason for the healthcare industry to practice competitive pricing, or competitive quality to get those individuals and others into the hospitals. So what we have is a healthcare system where the quality is diminishing, yet is still getting more expensive. The popular idea is to get the government even more involved, as if they didn't cause the mess in the first place. You could see a similar effect happening in higher education with the cost rapidly increasing, thanks to many of the students getting educated through some type of entitlement.

What it comes down to is either we want a quality healthcare system that can likely benefit most people, since hospitals/doctors should be competing with their prices. Or we want a mediocre or less healthcare system that is able to cover everyone, citizen or not, while maintain our running complaint of our bad healthcare system. 

I don't think poor people would just start dying, because there are charities, or hospital itself can decide to be charitable to lower incomes, especially for the majority of the ER visits. With competition brought back, just like pretty much every other product and service in the market, the costs will go down and the quality will increase. 

The difference between conservatism in general and liberalism in general, is that conservatives don't believe in some kind utopia where everyone wins, everyone has the same outcome, and everyone is together on everything. It's a whole lot of personal responsibility, learning from mistakes, recognizing an opportunity and seizing it., knowing that there are others going for the same objective and not everyone will make it. The emphasis on fairness over opportunity, as the country has been doing in a progressing fashion since FDR, is bearing its fruit now. Almost everyone is losing, nice and fair like, thanks to spending so heavily on the safety nets along with other public institutions, and most of the regulations on the market aren't helping the situation either.",Based on that decision  I don t see how a precedent wasn t set that made legislation somewhat similar easier to pass  Roberts called it a tax  under the assumption that everyone,25.0,TK-85 25,BasedonthatdecisionIdontseehowaprecedentwasntsetthatmadelegislationsomewhatsimilareasiertopassRobertscalleditataxundertheassumptionthateveryone,3825.891,4687.073

However, as it is implied in the last sentence, there is a wrongheaded assumption that people are just automatically going to be against tax increases so it won't happen again or often. Obama is currently campaigning on raising taxes, and he isn't falling flat on his face for doing so.

True, but there are also plenty of times where candidates run, and win, on not raising taxes.  To suggest that that people aren't going to automatically be against tax raises is a bad thing is where you start to lose me. (Which is a shame, because you have otherwise been doing me a pretty valuable service, like pointing out the stat about responsiveness. )

What I mean is, if it's never acceptable to ever raise taxes, only lower them, why not drown it in a bathtub now and cut everything to 0%?  

&gt;It is also worth noting that WHO is an agency within the UN which is likely to be biased towards big government type solutions, since that is in essence what the UN is, a huge government.

Okay, but, they also were pretty good on getting rid of smallpox.  So big government solutions can get something done, right?

&gt; Charity doesn't harm competition, if anything it can give a company a more positive image. There are at least a few big businesses that are charitable and very competitive, like McDonald's for example. To be competitive in business is to have a better product for a cheaper price, which in turn produces a profit, basically. The profit can then be used for several things, charity among them.

I wasn't suggesting it _harms_ competition, only that it isn't really incentivized.  It's money taken away from profits.  If a company can get more 'public image' through sheer advertising, than through charity, then that's how the calculus will play out.  There are at least a few big businesses who donate to charity and then spend more money on the PR campaign to talk about the donation.  It's a source of advertising, sure, but I don't think it's really one we can expect to play a large part, and shouldn't really be weighed in a national policy equation.  Expecting hospitals to pick up the slack through charity strikes me as a mistake, was my point.  After all, it isn't like Ronald McDonalds Houses _actually_ get most of their money from McDonalds.

Still, the responsiveness stat was big for me.  I guess I'm more swayed by numbers than things that strike my liberal brain as ideology.

&gt; True, Congress can now essentially tax people for not buying broccoli. But this power is not nearly as dangerous as the commerce power that was rejected. Congress can punish violations of its commerce power regulations with imprisonment. But under the tax power, the worst that can happen is a fine.

The US, according to WHO is ranked 37 last I checked, yet it is ranked 1 in the responsiveness to the needs and choices of the individual patient, which seems like one of if not the most relevant aspects of healthcare. The US has has some of the highest breast, colon and prostate cancer survival rates in the world. the US is also near the top in the world for kidney transplants, liver transplants, heart transplants, total knee replacements, coronary artery bypass, and percutaneous coronary interventions. The differences in the numbers according to WHO are minuscule ones, like give or take 2 years on average lifespan, or one or two more physicians. It seems most of the weight in that process is whether or not a country is using universal healthcare.

In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915-1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, the mentally ill, and others, who were unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million ""educated"" people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

That places total victims who lost their lives because of gun control at approximately 56 million in the last century. Since we should learn from the mistakes of history, the next time someone talks in favor of gun control, find out which group of citizens they wish to have exterminated.

Very interesting quote equating the lack of a school teaching only about a specific religion to stopping parents from raising their children how they see fit.

Religion still has a place in the home and, of course, church. This is where my religious upbringing came from, and had absolutely no involvement from the school. Looking back, I would've loved to have learned about other religions through a course like this so I wouldn't have to teach myself about it through the interwebs.

It isn't a wake-up call at all. It's already happened, the supreme court ruled it wasn't a violation of the charter of rights and freedoms, most everyone seems pretty okay with it. If the worst thing is that parents or churches have to spend more time teaching people about their religion, then good, involvement from the parents in a child's upbringing and education is waning and churches should be more responsible for the message and values that are being set in their own community.

To call this totalitarian, though, is ridiculous. It has been born by elected officials, went through the court system, tested by law, and still stands. Calling it totalitarian just because you don't like it is silly.

It will also allow the police to concentrate on real crime which should make us all feel safer. Marijuana is the place to start. Legalizing it, and in turn hemp itself, will create many avenues for business. How many times does it have to be shown that hemp has hundreds of uses. Just doing that will create business, jobs and revenue, not counting the recreational use of marijuana which should be taxed and regulated like alcohol.

Once that's done you move on to harder drugs. If alcoholism is recognized as a disease why not other addictions. Make getting help not such a stigma and allow for rehab. Just look to Portugal as a model for what can happen when you recognize addiction for what it is.

Quotes from the two links below. 

""The number of deaths by firearms in the United States was 32,000 last year. Around 11,000 were gun homicides.To understand how staggeringly high this number is, compare it to the rate in other rich countries. England and Wales have about 50 gun homicides a year — 3 percent of our rate per 100,000 people.""


""For most crimes — theft, burglary, robbery, assault — the United States is within the range of other advanced countries. The category in which the U.S. rate is magnitudes higher is gun homicides.""

""The U.S. gun homicide rate is 30 times that of France or Australia, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, and 12 times higher than the average for other developed countries.""

""They strongly suggest that we have so much more gun violence than other countries because we have far more permissive laws than others regarding the sale and possession of guns. With 5 percent of the world’s population, the United States has 50 percent of the guns""


""There is clear evidence that tightening laws — even in highly individualistic countries with long traditions of gun ownership — can reduce gun violence. In Australia, after a 1996 ban on all automatic and semiautomatic weapons — a real ban, not like the one we enacted in 1994 with 600-plus exceptions — gun-related homicides dropped 59 percent over the next decade. The rate of suicide by firearm plummeted 65 percent. (Almost 20,000 Americans die each year using guns to commit suicide — a method that is much more successful than other forms of suicide.)""


""A few hours before the Newtown murders last week, a man entered a school in China’s Henan province. Obviously mentally disturbed, he tried to kill children. But the only weapon he was able to get was a knife. Although 23 children were injured, not one child died.""

That is true.  Empirical data shows that when you ban guns on a national level, gun violence drops a significant amount.  Banning guns in a city, or in a state is obviously going to have little to no effect because of how easy it remains to get a gun with a mere two hour drive to a neighboring state or county.

Showing that Chicago or D.C. has a high rate of gun violence despite a ban is disingenuous.  Their bans are inherently ineffective due to the freedom to travel to places without bans, and the fact that having places without bans increases the amount of guns in the society.  In countries with strict gun control there are lower gun deaths because everyone's access to weapons is so much lower.  In cities, it makes next to no difference at all.

All of that doesn't matter though.  We cannot ban guns on the national level.  That's not a relevant conversation. What is relevant is ""why are people using these tools to kill each other?""  That is the problem that we need to tackle, not ""how can we reduce gun ownership?""

That's a pretty big ""if,"" and extremely unlikely, as close to impossible as one can get, that any students would wrest a firearm away from a teacher to go on a killing spree.  No one's talking about arming every teacher, but allowing for CCW holders to voluntarily carry a firearm on campus to eliminate the notion of ~~fish in a barrel~~ Gun Free Zones.

CCW holders are quite safe - as safe as the millions of police officers who carry firearms everywhere they go.  However, unlike police officers, armed teachers would already be on site should a mass murderer attack their school.  

As for your questions, to the best of my knowledge there is not currently any federal limit on a magazine's capacity.  Some states do limit them (such as California or D.C.)  With regard to types of arms we can legally own, I believe the current rules in place are fine, save for the stipulation that fully automatic firearms are illegal to purchase if they were made after 1986.  I believe the other requirements for class 3 weapons are more than adequate to ensure lawful ownership.

I fault the logic of gun control advocates on two counts:

1. We have absolutely nothing to fear from law-abiding citizens owning any type of firearm (or pretty much anything save for weapons that work on NBC scales.)  Occasions where a deranged person commits an unlawful act with a firearm are a legitimate concern.  
Any dangers posed by the proliferation of law-abiding gun ownership are more than offset by the additional protection it also affords.  There are many statistics to support this (such as the effect of the Kennesaw, Ga firearms ownership ordnance on crime statistics in that area, in particular on murder/manslaughter.)

2. Laws are *never* preventative, only *punitive*.  No matter how many laws we pass, we'll never prevent bad people from doing bad things.  The most we can hope to do is interrupt their commissions of crimes or to punish them after it.

Bearing points 1 and 2 in mind, it's very difficult for anyone to make a rational case for restricting the rights secured by the 2nd Amendment.  I've yet to hear a case that wasn't built on strawman arguments (e.g. ""You don't need an 'assault weapon' for hunting"") or emotional appeals.

You bring up a good point about not needing to match an attacker weapon-for-weapon, which is one of the reasons why I believe CCW teachers, properly trained, could be an effective form of defense against events like Columbine or Sandy Hook.", gt  I d worry that if students knew that teachers   or which teachers   had guns That s a pretty big  if   and extremely unlikely  as close to impossible as one,28.0,robotoverlordz 28,gtIdworrythatifstudentsknewthatteachersorwhichteachershadgunsThatsaprettybigifandextremelyunlikelyasclosetoimpossibleasone,2467.122,2991.427

Yes.  For two reasons:

1. These teachers would be carrying *concealed* weapons.  No one will ever see them unless they're to be used to save lives.  Furthermore, such a program should be set up so that only an administrator of the CCW Teachers Program and the CCW teacher himself (or herself) know that the teacher carries on campus.  So at most, students would know they attend an armed campus, but would have no idea which teachers were armed.
Even if, during a kid's short tenure through a particular school, some of them were to somehow find out that a particular teacher carried on campus, the odds of one of them actually trying to take the firearm away would be almost nil.  About the same chance as the sun not coming up tomorrow. There are cops on campuses that *openly* carry their weapons - when's the last time you heard about one of them having it taken and used in a shooting?  I'm going to have go with never.  

2. Even in the worst case scenario, where a kid finds out a teacher is armed, if that kid were going to attempt to shoot up the school, wrestling the firearm from the teacher would be about the least effective means of acquiring a firearm.  I mean, think about it, unless you're suicidal, are you really going to wrestle with someone you know to be armed?  How often do you think that would end up in a gun being taken from a teacher?

**The bottom line is that a CCW teacher program introduces no significant increase in risk to the students and provides a great deal of protection.**

&gt; And I realize that law-abiding citizens aren't dangerous with these guns. However, I see no RATIONAL argument in saying 'I NEED more than 10 rounds per magazine'.

You just made the argument yourself, ""And I realize that law-abiding citizens aren't dangerous with these guns.""  If law-abiding citizens aren't a danger, we can't rationally restrict their access.  

As far as drugs are concerned, that's irrelevant to the conversation.  There is no Constitutional amendment securing the right to keep and bear drugs.  To help you understand my full meaning here, this is how gun control advocates sound to my ears: 

""Terrorism is a problem that plagues our society, and the largest acts of terror, lately, have been committed by Muslims.  Therefore, in order to make our society safer, we need to restrict the number of mosques in a community, as well as limit their capacity so that it's harder for 19 Muslims to crash planes into our buildings.  This will make us safer.""

Sounds pretty ridiculous, doesn't it?  No one would ever think of restricting 1st amendment rights this way; yet, this is the same type of argument that is being used to restrict 2nd amendment rights.", gt  You REALLY think that arming teachers ISN T going to EVENTUALLY result in some student s  wrestling the gun away from a teacher and using it  Yes  For two reasons  1 ,,robotoverlordz NA,gtYouREALLYthinkthatarmingteachersISNTgoingtoEVENTUALLYresultinsomestudentswrestlingthegunawayfromateacherandusingitYesFortworeasons1,1962.387,2969.74

&gt; **Gun restriction laws applied only to handguns, not to long guns or ammunition**.

&gt; **The groups of people who were exempt from the acquisition permit requirement expanded.** 

&gt; **The age at which persons could own guns was lowered from 20 to 18.**

&gt; **The firearms carry permit was valid for three years instead of one year.**

&gt; **Jews were forbidden from the manufacturing or ownership of firearms and ammunition.**


It seems that gun rights were expanded for everyone but the Jewish people. This of course, raises the question, who is pushing gun control on our population today? You should not be surprised.

This certainly isn't the case for all liberals of good will. But for many of the younger crowd, owning a gun is simply icky and something that only those disgusting, toothless, ignorant red-staters do.

Granted, this is all anecdotal and my experience with college-aged liberals has been mostly limited to a light-blue bastion of progressive thought in an otherwise deeply red state.  But the disdain they had for us was palpable.  

And, in typical young liberal fashion, they honestly believed that we would definitely be on their side if we weren't too stupid or too willfully ignorant to accept their arguments as fact.

There are two things that really grind my gears about the gun debate.  First, that there's a debate at all.  Second, that people honestly believe that my rights are up for a vote and that I'd agree with them if I weren't too stupid to understand their position.  

As a center-right libertarian, I, to a fault, approach every argument I'm presented with rationally.

I find this to disingenuous.  Of course the US and Australia have other factors that contribute and not just firearm availability.  Also, of course the firearm related deaths will decrease.  It's not the method of death that is the problem... it's the deaths.  So, a far better comparison is to compare Australian homicide rates before and after the gun laws.

[Australian Institute of Criminology-Homicide victims from 1993 to 2007 (number per year)](http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.html) shows a slight dip in the number of homicides 7 years after 1996 gun control legislation was passed.  The ""Homicides involving firearms as a percentage of total homicides, 1915-2003"" graph sighting firearm violence rate shows a decrease prior to the 1996 laws and continuing after.  So, no obvious correlation there either.  What we can determine is the number of firearm related deaths went down while the number of homicides was relatively stable.  So more homicides must have been committed in other ways.

So, back to the point.  It's reducing the deaths that is the goal, not changing the method.  Guns are just an easy target (no pun intended).", gt the US has 9 7 times the number of firearm related deaths per capita than Australia  I find this to disingenuous  Of course the US and Australia have other factors that contribute,,FallingUp123 NA,gttheUShas97timesthenumberoffirearmrelateddeathspercapitathanAustraliaIfindthistodisingenuousOfcoursetheUSandAustraliahaveotherfactorsthatcontribute,3970.14,2401.827

I agree that improving mental health services will help prevent/stop the mass shootings.

I think there are some things we can do to make guns harder to get into the hands of criminals:

* Require background checks for private sales (i.e. close the ""gun show"" loop hole).
* Change the law that requires NICS destroy background search records in 24-48 hours, allowing a database to be built that can help identify ""cut outs"" that buy guns legally and sell on the black market.

The last one will be difficult for some to accept, as it is basically building a list of who owns what guns, which some will fear is a list that would be used to disarm civilians.  I don't really know how to counter that fear, but I do know that it is impossible for law enforcement agencies to find out who is buying guns and selling them on the street without such a database.

What won't help anything at all:

Absolutely not true.

Bush's term, and the regulation was implemented in March 1993.

If you ever used it, you'd be crucified by the state.


&gt;What's even sadder is that we live in a society where people taking guns to an office party or meeting seems needed.

You won't find any historical or factual references to this because nobody kept track of something they never asked about or polled, but carrying firearms was very common in the past, as recent as the 1900's, every man that had sense about him, even women, carried firearms for personal protection because it was common sense that you'd have something on your person to protect yourself.

There also wasn't any notion that you needed to ask the government for permission to carry, since it was thought of as a no-brainer that your God given right to bear arms shall not be infringed under any circumstances. 

The only references you can check are historical weapons museums and historians records, and see just how many small, personal protection oriented firearms were created over the past 100-150 years. 

There was clearly a market for it, firearms companies don't churn out firearms for an intended purpose if there is nobody to buy them. 

Also this notion of people feeling it necessary to carry firearms is a backhanded accusation of paranoia, and fear.

Does your house have a fire extinguisher? Are you paranoid or fearful of fire breaking out at any possible second? 

Or is it maybe a ""just in case"" type of concern?

How come though that in this attack, now that it's clear that the attacker was a Muslim, there are automatically assumptions of terrorism? Isn't there a double standard in waiting for the motive in one case and not in the other?

And obviously, liberals are guilty of the exact same thing- I'm not denying that. But one way or the other, shouldn't we wait for all the information to come in and wait to learn the motive before making an assumption of terrorism?

And on a separate, but still serious note, if you compare the aftermath of the Paris attacks, it could be said that Republican politicians were calling for the end to all Syrian refugees in the US, while the Democrats were urging to wait and help the victims and their families.

Now obviously, there are Republicans who were urging to wait and help, and Democrats who went on an anti-something (probably anti-gun to be fair) crusade in the aftermath of that attack, but predominantly (from what I saw and read in the news, including right-leaning news sources like the WSJ), the Republican politicians were the ones calling for political action.

Instead it's a matter of working to prevent these mass shootings from happening in the first place. Part of this is from defusing tensions over conflicts so that people don't feel like this is an acceptable or necessary action. Another part is a serious commitment to mental health so that people can actually get treatment instead of being left alone to get worse. And as much as I understand the importance of the second amendment, a big part of it is limiting and reducing access to firearms that aren't for hunting or personal/home defense. Pure and simple, this kind of mass shooting can't happen if you successfully restrict access to guns. It also would remove the primary defense the police have for their push towards militarization by removing the constant risk that any suspect could be armed and shoot them, making it much easier for the populace to pressure them to change course.

3858,2615,cxo6pcd,Thebxrabbit,Conservative,San Bernardino attack,1449336728,"Gonna try and respond to your points as succinctly as possible. First my suggestions weren't specific to stopping just this shooting, but to stop as many shootings as possible. So as a response to your first point I'll just mention that at the shooting at Clackamas community college in Oregon there were armed students on campus, in the veterans resource center who were barred from leaving to help by the faculty (rightfully so) because the cops wouldn't have known who was who and they'd just have made the situation more chaotic. So having more shooters involved is not a viable solution for a lot of active shooter scenarios. 

Second, you're absolutely correct that terrorists don't want to defuse this situation. Yhey want a fight, but they lack the resources to wage true war. So they're trying to provoke us into getting involved militarily and spending our resources in a fight that cannot be won while their ranks swell from all the people who grow up pissed off about Americans occupying their country and bombing it. If I had a simple plan to defuse this tension that I knew would work I wouldn't be scrolling through Reddit i'd be running for office. But I legitimately believe that the more we treat this like some kind of fight between us and them the harder it becomes to actually create peace.

Third, again not all of what I suggested is pertinent to this shooting, but would help with the massive amount of other shootings we have across the country. On the rest of your point I do agree. 

Fourth, the easiest differentiation that comes to mind is that I am fairly certain anything capable of firing full-auto or based off a military-issue weapon is not meant for hunting or home defense, so restricting access to those would help. And I understand that in this specific shooting the guns were illegal and it happened anyways. But I'm not just talking about this shooting, and the more difficult it is to access these types of weapons, the better it is because it makes it that much harder for people to commit these crimes and makes it more likely they'll be found out before the shooting starts. 

Finally, I can't speak too much towards France because I'm not as familiar with their laws and police situation. I brought up militarization because it's a cause of other problems within this country that are not directly related to mass shootings. I completely agree that it is better to have the police possessing body armor and high powered rifles for when these rare situations arise. I'd just rather they not be using it for routine non-violent warrant searches or against civil protestors.

The whole shooting in California could have been ended by the time the police arrived on scene even though they extraordinarily fast because they were running a training exercise nearby. I'm not positive but I believe that the laws for CHL require that once the threat has ended they clear their weapons and alert the police to the weapon while keeping their hands visible or on their head so the police can differentiate between active shooters and lawful defenders. More shooters won't stop every shooting but they can prevent more casualties and make bad guys think more about their decisions. One of the top posts on /r/conservative in the last couple of days has been an article that shooting across the nation are down but they are up in ""gun-free zones"". Criminals know law-abiding citizens don't break the law and that makes ""gun-free zones"" an easy soft target with at least a 10 minute rampage before police arrive on scene.

They don't care how nice we are. France did not participate in the Iraq War because they didn't want to intervene in the Middle East's politics. France has taken in thousands of refugees from the Middle East, literally saving the lives of thousands of Muslims. Yet the Islamic State repays them with blood and death. Non-intervention is not the answer because they already have their propaganda and recruitment, we must get the Middle Eastern governments and Muslims on our side and actively root out the extremists from their ranks. 

The ATF has to approve and license you to buy a full-auto weapon legally. Being based off of a military weapon has nothing to do with the power or killing ability of a weapon. My father owns an AR-15, virtually all that are owned by citizens are semi-automatic, and he cannot use it for deer hunting in our state because it is simply not powerful enough to consistently kill a deer in one shot. I own a 30.06 deer rifle that is legal to hunt the largest game in North America with and it semi-automatic. The look of the gun or size of the magazine doesn't affect the power. 

It can be a problem in some situations, most small towns don't need armored personnel carriers, but these situations show the need for police to be able to respond to the force that our enemies are willing to bring to bear without having to use the military to settle violent situations within our borders because that is a slippery slope. Look at the 2008 Mumbai shootings, India has a stringent process for purchasing even ammunition but the attackers brought in AKs and killed hundreds of people. Police in large cities need to be able to respond to threats like this, especially if citizens are not allowed to be armed to defend themselves.

Fair enough, and I admit a misunderstanding of the stat before I quoted it. Still stands that more people were killed by knives, than by long guns/rifles/assault weapons, which seem to be the war cry of the current gun control message. Same does go for blunt weapons vs that class of weapon. If you go digest the current gun control argument, it is to make RIFLES harder to come by. They never want to touch handguns. Unless you have a Concealed Carry, most states have a 3 day waiting period on handgun purchases. It is REALLY hard to get a handgun. I know, I've gone through it.

&gt; You give one example of a guy getting by background checks and screening and use that as one reason why new legislation won't work. How many people have been stopped by the background checks and screenings?

That example was of one of the San Bernandino shooters getting past a higher scrutinized background check, just to enter the country. So why would anyone think extended background checks for firearms would do anything more on gun control? That is one of many examples, just the most poignant in the discussion. We already have great background checks that catch &gt; 90% of what they are supposed to. Why fix what isn't broken?

&gt; No one is arguing that new laws and regulations will prevent all shootings and mass shootings. No one reasonably thinks that is the case. 

I'm sorry, but that **is** exactly what people think is the case. Your selective wording of *all* is a misnomer. The discussion is leading people to believe that if we can pass this ""magical"" legislation, that gives the government that much more power and control over something, we will stop these shootings. Listen to their wording, it isn't reduce, it isn't lower, it is **stop**... Altogether. That is what the POTUS believes, that is what legislators in favor of gun control are spouting, and that is what the uninformed public 100% think will happen if we enact ""better gun control"" laws.

&gt; What a lot of people do think is that with better regulation, laws, and enforcement we can reduce the number of deaths from guns.

[Reduce what? 8000 firearm deaths? 248 rifle deaths?](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2010-2014.xls) There are more deaths from car accidents and drunk driving... Either of those is a very small portion of the population that is affected... The 8000 people is 0.000025% of the population... The Rifles are 0.0000008%. I am not trying to be hard hearted, and detract from those families pain. But making stricter laws on something that is such a small percentage of the population. That speaks louder to wanting control than it is about curtailing the violence...

&gt; I trust myself with a gun and you seem like a reasonable person so I would probably trust you with a gun. I don't trust most other people with guns, the idea of getting rid of gun free zones is something I can't agree with.

This we will have to agree to disagree on. Your issue of trust is moot. Your lack of trust does not entitle anyone else the capability to remove self defensive measures from your fellow citizenry. Our legislators and businesses have done it anyway.

Secondly, I take issue with your claim that ""white christian males"" are more dangerous.

I'm gonna be fair and ignore 9/11, because that would heavily skew the numbers because a little under 3000 people died, due to islamic extremism.

The Boston Marathon bombing killed 6 people, not to mention the hundreds of people injured.

The Fort hood shooting killed 13 people.

San Bernardino shooting kills 16.

In comparison, the recent planned parenthood shooter killed 4 people, and before that george tiller died.

I don't know about you, but just in terms of ""people killed"", fanatical muslims have probably killed more then fanatical christians, and they're far more organized.

There are probably way more cases of arson and vandalism when it comes to anti abortion attacks, but islamic terrorists are more deadly, just looking at recent cases.

Also attacks on abortion clinics are really ineffective because it just gives democrats something to talk about for the next few months and delegitimize people with prolife views. Killing and vandalism doesn't fix abortion being legal.

&gt;They were two hate-filled, bigoted municipal employees interacting in one department. Now 13 innocent people are dead in unspeakable carnage.

&gt;One man spent his free time writing frightening, NRA-loving, hate-filled screeds on Facebook about the other’s religion.

&gt;The other man quietly stewed and brewed his bigotry, collecting the kind of arsenal that the Facebook poster would have envied.

&gt;What they didn’t realize is that except for their different religions they were in many ways similar men who even had the same job.

&gt;One man, the Muslim, was a loser who had to travel all the way to Pakistan to get himself an email bride. (I refuse to add to their fame by using the killer and his murderous wife’s names.)

&gt;That wife radicalized him and fueled his hatred. The FBI is investigating her ties to Al Qaeda and ISIS. Go to the Middle East, meet your new wife, meet some terror leaders, begin your wedded bliss back in the USA.

&gt;The other man, the victim, Nicholas Thalasinos, was a radical Born Again Christian/Messianic Jew, who also connected with his future wife online and had traveled across the country to meet her.

&gt;The killer, however, became half of an Islamic Bonnie &amp; Clyde, while the other died as the male equivalent of Pamela Geller.

&gt;The killers deserve every disgusting adjective thrown at them. And more.

&gt;But the victim is also inaccurately being eulogized as a kind and loving religious man.

&gt;Make no mistake, as disgusting and deservedly dead as the hate-filled fanatical Muslim killers were, Thalasinos was also a hate-filled bigot. Death can’t change that. But in the U.S., we don’t die for speaking our minds. Or we’re not supposed to anyway.

&gt;Thalasinos was an anti-government, anti-Islam, pro-NRA, rabidly anti-Planned Parenthood kinda guy, who posted that it would be “Freaking Awesome” if hateful Ann Coulter was named head of Homeland Security. He asked, “IS 1. EVERY POLITICIAN IS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR? 2. EVERY POLITICIAN IS A MORON? 3. EVERY POLITICIAN IS RACIST AGAINST JEWS?” He also posted screeds like, “You can stick your Muslim Million Man march up your asses,” and how “Hashem” should blow up Iran.

&gt;His Facebook page warns that “Without HEALTHY PREGNANT WOMAN (Democrats) would have NO SOURCE of BABIES to SACRIFICE and SELL!”

&gt;We have freedom of speech but even so, a city worker should refrain from such public bigotry. Municipal workers have been fired for spewing and posting racial and sexual slurs.

&gt;On the other side, the killer and his Jihad-loving Pakistani wife were keeping their hatred quiet, while legally assembling an arsenal of assault weapons, 7,000 rounds of ammo, and illegally making 15 pipe bombs under their neighbors’ noses.

&gt;Whatever spurred the carnage, the end result was the murder and maiming of innocent people enjoying a holiday party.

&gt;Keeping an arsenal is a protected right, but using the term, “Christmas” party?

You cannot honestly have a decent grasp of the history of Christianity and still believe this. 

&gt; I dont think their is any geo-politcal situation that you could throw these radicals into that would change what they believe.

What they believe and what they do with those beliefs is separate. Or do you think that people on the far right end of the Christian spectrum such as the WBC and their ilk, numerous abortion clinic bombers, neo Nazis, etc etc have beliefs less violent and less ass-backwards as ISIS? 

&gt; Sure, the Bible has some horrible violence in the old testament, but these old laws were for the Jews and have no authority over the Christians of the new testament.

And yet the Bible contains both. You can't pick and choose which aspects of your religion are 'true' just because the brutal parts make you uncomfortable. 

And I don't hear people bitching about Judaism's 'endemic predisposition to violence.'

You don't have a literalist interpretation of the Bible, you're not 100% to the book Christian, and you should be proud. 

There are literally millions of Muslims with the same view of the shitty parts of their book as you have of the shitty parts in yours. They take the good parts of their book and follow them, realizing that not all of it is relevant today because times change. 

Sure, Islam was literally spread by the sword. But you must understand that in those times, religion was often a unifying factor for a tribe or tribes and if the religion was not strict and explicit about how to behave and how to self-perpetuate, the tribe could be wiped out. 

TL; DR: all religions, especially Abrahamic ones, are big stinky pieces of shit, and you mustn't let current historical circumstance  lull you into the belief that one of them is extra smelly. It's not. They all suck.

Check out the wikipedia articles for [The Bible and violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_violence) and [The Quran and violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran_and_violence).

I don't think a marginal difference in violence is a fair description.

Jesus' stance on violence couldn't be more clear in the Bible

&gt; Ephesians 4:32 – ""Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you"".

&gt;Luke 6:27 – “But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you"".

&gt;Matthew 5:43-48 – “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?"".

&gt;Matthew 26:52 ""But Jesus said to him, “Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword"". (Jesus said this after Peter had struck one of the soldiers who were attempting to arrest Jesus. Jesus subsequently healed the soldier's wound).

&gt;Romans 12:17-21 ""Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone"".

&gt;1 Peter 3:9 ""Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing"".

&gt;1 John 2:9-10 ""Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble"".

In contrast, the Quran is just a user guide for war.

I also don't think it is fair to say the actions of the Catholic church a thousand years ago have anything to do with the Bible. Back then, people did not have access to the scriptures of the Bible themselves (before printing press), They relied on the priests to read and interpret these things. The Catholic Church abused this power and misrepresented the scriptures with impunity.

Although I have different views to you, I respect that you've at least thought through your beliefs and recognise the cesspit that is the default subs. 

I'm also a college student, however I didn't go to college straight out of high school. I learned a trade and worked with unions, all that jazz. I didn't like anything the unions stood for (in my country). 

My beliefs are economic right wing and social centre. I think a strong government could be beneficial regarding the economic side, however I think it's unattainable because I don't believe most politicians are capable of being effective managers. I believe this, because their jobs rely on being liked by the population, so they're less likely to make hard but essential decisions.

Voting as someone else is illegal and is very difficult to enforce. That doesn't make it a bad law. There aren't good mechanisms to enforce it because, in many places, we don't require people to prove their identity when they vote.

Then there's the lack of motivation to enforce laws. There are many instances where the person filling out the ATF 4473 form check the box for ""No"" on the question of whether they are purchasing the weapon for themselves. That is an automatic rejection. Then they will try again the next day and mark ""Yes"" for that question. That alone raises probable cause to investigate the purchaser to determine if he attempted to buy the gun for a prohibited person. Just lying on the form is a felony and can land you in jail for up to 10 years.

Further, a licensed firearm dealer is prohibited by law from selling a firearm to a straw purchaser. So in cases where there is an apparent straw purchaser (i.e. they state that they are buying the gun for another person), the dealer is supposed to refuse the sale.

The DOJ chooses not to prosecute these crimes. Even when there is evidence of lying on the form or that a straw purchase was made, the DOJ just doesn't have any motivation to investigate it.

Therein lies the truth. The push for more gun control is only to move the needle more toward prohibition.

The officer continues: ""He asked me to admit that she was 'hot.' He asked me, 'You want the truth?' When I told him I did he said, 'I was gonna drive around the corner and get a blow job.

You forget that this mass murder occurred in California, who has the strictest gun laws in the country. The guns used were banned, and SO WERE THE PIPEBOMBS. Yet they still managed to make and use them.

You forget that this happened in a GUN-FREE ZONE. Guns were banned from the premises. Who stopped them from bringing them there? Only unarmed sheep.

You refuse to understand that there is no such thing as 'assault rifles.'. The 'AR' in AR-15 means ""ArmaLite Rifle"" who is the original inventor of the gun style. This was not a machine gun.

You refuse to blame the murderer and rather blame the tools. It's easier to take away rights of law-abiding citizens rather than ADMIT people did not do their fucking job to STOP the murder in the first place, and those people need to be punished.

Those three months of waiting only applies to law-abiding citizens. This guy got the gun from his neighbor illegally. Did he wait 3 months? CRIMINALS DO NOT BUY GUNS LEGALLY thus circumventing your proposed hypothesis.

Now here is the TL:DR version: Violent Crimes are highest in ALL Democrat-controlled cities and states. They all implement strict anti-2nd Amendment laws and yet it makes matters worse in every scenario. The only solution *is* to stop this bullshit of deterring law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves because *the police take 10 minutes to get there while it takes seconds for the victim to kill the intruder.*

Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries, improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live.

A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement, the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.

Individual Muslims may show splendid qualities, but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world.

I shouldn't be expected to have to change my culture just to make others feel comfortable though, so long as I am not physically harming them. Also, fear and panic should never be a reason to take away rights, and given the sheer low percentage of criminals who are arrested through simply being spotted on the street, I don't see that as a valid excuse. 

The burqa is not a religious garment, but a cultural one. Nevertheless, it is all the same to me. I am very uncomfortable with the idea of a government dictating what its citizens can or cannot wear as if we're middle school students who don't know what is best for us. That is a huge overstep in the government's function. Why don't they just tell us what to eat and when to go to bed? (they already do, to an extent) Should I not be able to wear saggy pants because a gun can be concealed more easily under them? Should I not be allowed to wear a hat just in case I might be smuggling drugs over my head? This type of logic does not hold up, and to me this policy seems to be born exclusively out of xenophobia rather than ""safety."" It is just like how France banned ""all religious items"" in public school when more students were wearing the hijaab. Do you honestly think they passed that law thinking about students wearing a cross around their neck? 

Mind you, either way, whether it's for defense or xenophobia, I am against this law for the reasons described above. And as for the few cases, none of which I can think of which occurred in Europe or the USA, concerning terrorists harboring weapons under a burqa, that logic can be applied to any article of clothing as I was saying earlier.", gt  People need to identify each other just to function in a society I shouldn t be expected to have to change my culture just to make others feel comfortable though ,28.0,LookingToLoseItAll 28,gtPeopleneedtoidentifyeachotherjusttofunctioninasocietyIshouldntbeexpectedtohavetochangemyculturejusttomakeothersfeelcomfortablethough,1406.398,2342.276

Sure you do. It's called society. If your ""culture"" says you should run around naked punching women in the face, then I'm sorry disappoint you, but you're going to get pushback.

Gun Free Zones. The idea that these kill zones make us safer is absurd. In the vast majority of states you need to pass a thorough FBI background check to obtain your concealed carry permit. The no guns allowed sign keeps out those law abiding civilians and allow psychopaths to kill at will. These nut jobs do not let a sticker on a door prevent them from carrying out their sick, evil plans. Every school should have 5-10 faculty members trained and armed with a concealed firearm. These brave teachers will have to go through extra training in order to qualify. I would say a 30 hour training course, monthly visits to the gun range and the most extensive background check/psych exam available every 6 months. Only the superintendent and the principal will know who is armed. No, a little Ruger LC9 will not fall onto the floor and accidentally shoot itself. The students will never know the teacher is armed. Yeah having guns to defend students won't prevent every shooting or every death during a shooting, but the killer may only shoot 5 people instead of 30 because they will be met with a good guy with a gun. Many of ""gun nuts"" are rational and do not have sex with our Colts and Glocks. We are willing to hear ideas on how to decrease the roughly 8500 firearm murders per year, but all of what is proposed will do nothing to combat gun violence. All it will do is infringe on the rights of law abiding citizens. Accidents with firearms are a problem. Most gun owners are in favor of holding parents accountable if a child gets a hold of a loaded gun and uses it on themselves or another person. There is no reason for an unsecured pistol to be within reach of a toddler. The penalty should be a minimum of 5 years if a death results and a lesser sentence if an injury occurs. Obama's idea to ban people on the terror watch list from owning guns is a direct violation of our constitutional right to due process. Here is an article from the left wing daily beast that argues against banning people from the terror watch list from owning firearms. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/07/my-fellow-liberals-don-t-support-obama-s-terror-watch-list-gun-ban.html

4129,438,cy1bd0n,garmonboziamilkshake,Republican,San Bernardino attack,1450293334,"&gt; Why do you think someone else should pay for the medical care of a stranger?

Why are you presupposing my views? Did my question rattle you that much?

Sorry about your brother, but I don't recall suggesting he should get free healthcare, much less any health insurance approach.

The only other question implied by my rather straightforward one might be:

*Is there a way to ensure that people with ongoing medical conditions can afford to treat it?* I asked if your market-based approach would provide that.

I agree there's a problem with how health insurance works - it would probably work better akin to home insurance - catastrophic policy, and then something like a home warrantee to deal with smaller issues, maintenance, ongoing costs - more akin to your 'community doctor' idea (though that wouldn't address the many specialties necessary in medicine today).

In most other insurance regimes, there's a sense that the insured is somewhat responsible for their predicament in taking risk - you're a shitty driver? You get high premiums. You want to live in a Malibu house on stilts in earthquake/fire/mudslide country? You're gonna pay a lot for a policy.

That's true to some extent with health - no one forces people to eat like shit, or smoke, etc.

But, e.g., when your kid is born with a congenital defect that will require a lot of ongoing tests, medication and surgeries to survive, unless you happen to be extremely wealthy, you're going to need a plan to afford that treatment, or the kid will die.  

All I was asking is if you thought your idea would provide people in that predicament with a plan to pay for it. (A market-based approach would undoubtedly reduce some medical costs, but the idea that ongoing testing, surgery and rare medications will ever be easily affordable is a fantasy.)

I'm not saying society *has to* come up with a plan - it can decide that life is rough, and some people just get a bad hand. I was asking if you had a plan, or if you think one is unnecessary. I think I have my answer.", gt  Why do you think someone else should pay for the medical care of a stranger  Why are you presupposing my views  Did my question rattle you that much  Sorry,,garmonboziamilkshake NA,gtWhydoyouthinksomeoneelseshouldpayforthemedicalcareofastrangerWhyareyoupresupposingmyviewsDidmyquestionrattleyouthatmuchSorry,2992.461,2045.596

All they were waiting on, remember, was a good enough excuse. 90% of the congress is SWAMP and **WOULD** impeach given a good enough cover narrative.

4341,13048,dzk3xfv,PerceivedShift,Conservative,Santa Fe High School shooting,1527256838,"I did some more research recently regarding possible correlation between gun homicides and gun laws.  I didn't read biased articles or any of that non\-sense, I looked at raw data, again.  The correlation between *gun* homicides and gun laws is extremely weak.  Not only across the states, but also at the international level.  There are many outliers on both sides of the argument making it very easy to pick and choose such examples to support each sides argument. However the fact is strict gun laws =/= lower or increased homicide rates.  In some cases where there are strict gun control laws, I found* gun homicid*e rates to be lowe*r*, however* overall homicid*e rates were at or higher than a country's expected value based on something I found which lead me to reply to you.

You are very close with your statement that it boils down to culture.  I wouldn't say the US has ""way, way, way"" more ""gun violence"" than other countries.  Our gun homicides rates are still at the low end from an international level.  You are on the right track however putting the focus on culture.  The US is much more culturally diverse than just about ANY other country in the developed world which liberals love to compare the US against.  With this fact in hand I dug to find a strong correlation, I found one, and it made me realize why the real solution to gun homicide or homicides rates as a whole, nobody dares to touch.  The real correlation is between *homicide rates and ethnic groups* and the culture these groups bring with them.  See why politicians will not touch it?  Even I run the risk of being called racist for simply pointing out facts.  The fact is each ethnic group brings with it an average homicide rate, some bring high rates, while others bring low rates.  You can't make a direct comparison to the US as a whole because much of Europe is very homogeneous, better comparisons can be made at a state level.  Take Vermont for example, the least homogeneous state in the US and ethnically comparable to the UK.  Vermont, amazingly has some of the least strict gun laws in the country with 70&amp;#37;\+ of households owning guns.  This gun ownership rate is still exceeds all other countries in the world.  Vermont also happens to have homicide rates comparable to the UK.  This is only one example of many, I may write an article on this one day, but compiling and visualizing the data will take some time.

So the answer to bring homicide rates down is to address *why* some ethnic groups bring higher crime rates.  However its not all doom and gloom, as overall crime rates have been on a steady decline worldwide for decades, so we are in fact doing something right.  But throwing around more gun laws isn't the answer as the data doesn't support it.

If you look back two generations or earlier, children competed aggressively in sports or other activities, both organized and on their own.  Winners were celebrated, and losers had to either get better, or find something else they were good at. Sports, chess, debate, whatever.

Today, especially in elementary school age groups, children are frequently not allowed to lose.  Sports are played and scores are not kept.  There are no special rewards for winners, simply participation trophies.

Once kids make it to high school age, they start to experience real competition for the first time.  Some of them are exposed to the new 'trauma' of losing for the first time.

Some of these students who have spent their early lives with no experience losing at anything simply cannot learn to deal with losing because they were taught so thoroughly that everyone is a winner, and simply trying your best was good enough to be rewarded.

So, these broken children advance through high school experiencing the harshness of the real world for the first time, and eventually, they snap and lash out violently.  Sometimes they finish high school and make it out to the real world, which is even less forgiving, before they snap.

Want to deal with islamic extremism and rape culture? You can't, not until the extreme left are removed from their positions of power. 

Same goes for media corruption and the 'soft coup' currently happening in the USA. They cheated as much as they dared in the last US election and there was no come back, zero consequences. What do you think will happen next time, or when Trump is gone? They have seen that many will support their illegal activities, and think the end justifies the means. They will be much more blatantly corrupt. And anyone who tries to take them to task will be smeared and dismissed as 'far right' with the full support of the media.

What would you do in that situation? Also the gunpowder and shot angle showed it was close range and suggested Martin’s clothes were hanging over Zimmerman. (Indicating Martin was on top when shot.)

I think it’s clear that deadly force was justified, what the question is for me is who provoked the fight. While I definitely think Zimmerman is allowed to ask a hooded figure at night why they’re walking through people’s yards, I’m curious as to whether Martin was cooperative or defensive. 

And that’s where all the debate goes. Personally when I was analyzing it I noticed things about Martin’s background. His autopsies showed he had damaged liver and brain from heavy drug abuse (at 18), and his social media showed he had transitioned into a tough guy thug wannabe. He just seems to have been potentially aggressive towards someone who didn’t appear armed. 

This whole case had nothing to do with race btw, media fabricated that whole angle. They even edited the 911 call to make it appear Zimmerman was racist.  And I really doubt a Hispanic guy living in a multiracial neighborhood is running amateur Klan hour.

The student is a senior from Santa Fe High School named Nicole Janice. Her classmates weren't snubbing her because of her race, explained the girl's mother, but didn't hold her hand because Nicole would get too emotional before belting out the national anthem.

""The 'black girl' is my daughter. It's people like you that keep the race crap stirred up,"" wrote the girl's mother, Lynda. ""You just look for ways to make things about race. These girls are her friends. You have no idea what you are talking about so you just need to shut up.""

Yes unless been shown to be dangerous (which a mere diagnoses does not show), and fortunately the ATF will not prevent you from owning guns just because you have schizophrenia.  Despite what you hear on the news Schizophrenia is not a dangerous mental illness, schizophrenics are far more likely to victims of crime then they are to commit crime.

&gt;Some personality disorders are very dangerous.

This is where I disagree with you completely, some people are dangerous, there is no mental illness that makes people automatically dangerous.

&gt;I think you are laboring under the idea that I believe all mental illnesses are dangerous, which I have never said, nor do I believe.

No but you do seem to believe that some diagnoses do make people dangerous.  And that is just not true.  Some schizophrenics can be dangerous, but sweeping all schizophrenics under the same rug just shows a lack of education about the illness.

&gt;And, there are cases where these people are permitted to check themselves out, without notifying any family, or any caretakers. 

The ATF has very specific guidelines on what disqualifies you from owning a gun.  http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf

4500,21802,dnr6hhb,LikeAWombatScorned,The_Donald,Las Vegas shooting,1506864687,"&gt; That, for instance, is what the
Myanmar government did following the Nargis cyclone in 2008. They insisted on having United Nations aid delivered to the government or barred from the
country. Why? Because, as we noted earlier, the military dictatorship wanted to use the aid to enrich itself by selling food on the black market rather than
distributing it to those most in need. You might think this was the odd behavior of a horrible regime, atypical of the response of government leaders
following natural disasters. Not so! Consider the case of Oxfam relief for Sri Lanka in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.
&gt;
&gt; Following  a  massive  earthquake  on  December  26,  2004,  a  tsunami  sent  huge  waves  of  water  rushing  inland,  killing  over  230,000  people  across
fourteen nations. Subsequent assistance totaled over $14 billion. Yet even while the goal of aid agencies might have been to relieve suffering, many
recipient governments took it as an opportunity to enrich themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; To distribute aid, Oxfam shipped twenty-five four-wheel-drive trucks to the region. The Sri Lankan government impounded the trucks and insisted that
Oxfam pay a 300 percent import duty. For over a month (the first critical month after the tsunami) the trucks sat idle and people went without food and
shelter. Eventually Oxfam paid over $1 million to have its trucks released.
&gt; 
&gt; Before giving to a charity many people like to assess how much of their donation goes to help people versus how much is spent on overhead. Oxfam
America, for instance, gets three out of four stars from Charity Navigator, an organization that rates charities. Oxfam spends 6 percent of its revenue on
administrative expenses and 14 percent on fundraising. The remaining 80 percent is spent on programs, that is, helping people. Unfortunately, 80 cents
on the dollar is not the effective amount of help provided. Remember those trucks and the 300 percent import duty—if such cases are the norm (and they
usually are) the actual aid benefit may only equate to 20 cents on the dollar. If even as careful a charity as Oxfam is being shaken down, then it makes us
wonder what is happening to the rest.
&gt; 
&gt; It is virtually impossible to quantify how much aid gets diverted towards the recipient government’s objectives rather than the donor’s intended goals.
However,  we  suspect  this  figure  is  huge.  The  fundamental  problem  is  that  recipient  governments  are  not  appropriately  incentivized  to  fix  problems.
Consider the recent case of flooding in Pakistan in 2010. No one can blame the government for the rains, but they are very much accountable for the
subsequent devastation. Over 20 million people were affected, 4 million made homeless, and nearly 2,000 died.
&gt; 
&gt; Following severe floods in the 1970s, Pakistan set up a Federal Flood Commission. On paper this agency has completed about $900 million worth of
dike construction. Of course the reality is very different. Irrigation and flood control are a source of graft, not public policy. And when the dikes are built,
they serve the interests of the wealthy; that is, coalition members, not the people. As the floods swept downstream and threatened huge segments of the
population, President Zardari, who is nicknamed “Mister 10 percent” for his alleged penchant to take that portion as his cut, acted as a good autocrat
should. He ignored the problem, headed off to Europe for a highprofile tour and left his government to sacrifice the many to save the few. The government
reinforced  dikes  to  protect  essential  supporters  while  allowing  flooding  to  continue  in  poor  areas. Areas  with  ethnic  minorities  and  large  numbers  of
opposition supporters were particularly likely to flood.
