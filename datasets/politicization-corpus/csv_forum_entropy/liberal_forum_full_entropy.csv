10,133,c7h4ueh,[deleted],Liberal,Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting,1355607510,"It's a twofold problem.

1. Yes, it's very easy to obtain guns in the US, legally or illegally. People who want guns can and will get them somehow. Yes, we should and do have regulations in place, but the problem with illegally obtained weapons overrides this pretty quickly. The reddit hivemind should already understand why regulation is better than prohibition in this sense, but with gun control it's a whole different monster.

2. It's also very difficult in the US healthcare system to get effective mental health treatment (having two family members whose issues were ignored throughout their public school experience despite it being obvious, and only were addressed later because, lucky for us, we can afford it).

So, you have people who are hopelessly lost because they can't access proper mental healthcare, but they can get a gun pretty damn easily for reasons wholly independent of US government regulations on gun ownership.

I see a good solution to one of those problems, and only complicated, ineffective solutions to the other.

We need better methods of detecting and treating mental illness, starting with teachers and counselors in our elementary schools to identify potential cases of mental illness and take them seriously, continuing through high school, with college/job placement assistance, life-skills classes, easy access to specialized therapists, and medication if it is deemed necessary. The parents, school staff, therapists, teachers, and peers all need to be aware and involved in these issues. Mentally ill people should not be ostracized for being open about their problems and going to treatment (and kids are total dicks, which is why you need therapy and education programs in place to give these people an outlet).

And honestly I think the government should be paying for it all, because I'm not about to pretend that mentally ill people or their parents are able to provide money for that treatment without creating a worse situation for themselves which won't help the problem at all.

And I would happily pay higher taxes if the government could do that.

The pessimistic part of me feels like it will become a bloated ineffective piece of shit that makes sure a lot of people make money and not as many people get proper treatment.

So yeah, gun control has proven ineffective, and I don't trust in the government to handle the other solution without fucking it up...

liar, no such thing happened. 

&gt;Even you were finally forced to admit you couldn't find that image on davidduke.com, although you desperately searched and searched and searched andsearched andsearched.... LOL

Again, you're a liar. The image is still sitting where you linked to it: http://www.davidduke.com/images/Drama_Queen.jpg What no one was able to find was your claim of it being a part of Google's image search index. 

&gt;The image was of that crying ""leave brittney alone"" kid and I pulled it straight from google images. You know all of this is true but you continue to lie because lies, comic books and pervy tattoos are all you have, being none too bright.

Yup, that's the image but you're lying again because Google Images does not have that file in it's index for davidduke.com because of the robots.txt file that prevents Google's index system from searching the directory. The image is not in Googles search index which means you had to know exactly where the file was located (ya know... on david.com) or copy and paste the link from a place where the URL is commonly used. The only place I've found it being used it by you and on Stormfront.org 

You keep making up this ridiculous story that simply is untrue. If it were true you'd be able to provide a link to the Google Image search page where it appears. Go ahead Bigot, post the link. 

&gt;And, as you also know perfectly well, the so-called Stormfront story was a story about Israel's brutal treatment of Africans, which I posted from the very mainstream site http://thenational.ae/ - which you claim I got from Stormfront although you had no real evidence. BTW I imagine Stormfront reprints a lot of mainstream stories but I'm not sure, since I've never been to Stormfront.

Again, caught in a lie. You copied and pasted the story directly from Stormfront's forum and were in such a hurry to do so you grabbed the post text with it. My only regret is that I called you out on it and you edited the post before I could grab a screen shot.

The ban had been in place for 12 years by that point.  Which shouldn't be a problem considering the data in the study you cited stops in 2010.

UK homicide rate, according to the study you cited:

95       96       97        98       99     00    01     02    03    04     05     06    07     08     09            
1.6	1.5	1.5	1.6	1.6	1.7	1.8	2.1	1.8	1.7	1.5	1.5	1.5	1.3	1.2


(unfortunately this doesn't format well, please see your link)

The ban showed no decrease in homicides the first year.  For the next five years *the homicide rate grew until it was 40% higher than when the ban went into affect*.   With these results, how can the UK's example be considered desirable?

Rate then returns to 97 rate for three years.  Happly, the rate drops for the last two years, 12-13 years after the ban.  How can this drop be attributed to the ban, without accounting for other powerful factors such as demographics?

Less emotional? How about I mirror you and become plain old evasive and manipulative? 

First: the link is to an article that notes that car deaths are declining and gun deaths are rising. The headline makes the point that maybe we can reverse the increase in gun deaths with some form of controls. Granted, it makes that point in a snarky way, but this is r\/democrats, not r\/tiptoearoundthebear. You don't really respond to the actual point.

Second, how did you respond? You claim that some deaths are not applicable to the discussion, then accuse the other side of cherry picking. Should we remove from the car side the deaths where no fault was assigned or single-car accidents? In actuality, which cause kills more people is irrelevant. If gun deaths were a tiny fraction of car deaths, you might have a case that gun deaths aren't significant and the entire issue should be handled another way. But gun deaths are already in the ballpark of car deaths, so we might just be justified in looking at how we can lower those, even if car deaths as a whole never drop below the number of gun deaths.

If you really wanted to address the point and be observant, you could have noted that we've had civil liability, restraints, crush zones, air bags, etc., since the 90s and earlier, but the real plunge in car deaths has happened since 2008. Miles driven and the size (ultimate lethality) of cars, it seems, might be the big difference. Maybe there's something to be learned there. Could the solution be, not more guns, but fewer gun, and less lethal guns? Uh oh.

Before that happens, the industry should at least be subject to the kind of safety regulations and civil liability that would test out the alternative to simply reducing the numbers.

Prison reform is fine, but I'd add that for profit prisons should be illegal. 

Drug decriminalization I'm cool with as well. Put all the money we currently spend on the War on Drugs into treatment funding. 

I'm probably good with ending some subsidies for businesses but not others. Subsidies can be a good way to incentivize companies or consumers to adopt to behavior that benefits society. Such as adopting renewable energies, etc. 

The tax idea would probably depend on how it shakes down. We could probably find things we agree on there and things we don't. 

I'm completely against adding guns into the school curriculum. There are actual skills we need to be teaching so that we stop falling behind other countries, adding an additional burden for teachers to waste time on just sets us back more. Most schools do have some kind of sex ed but it can certainly be improved which is what I imagine you mean. Comprehensive and fact based sex ed that's sex positive (or at least not puritanical) would be great. 

Finance I think is a tough one because it'd be impossible to get people to agree on a curriculum. There's lots of shitty financial advice that people follow and give and that could certainly be abused by policy makers to push their own agenda. Civics is definitely something worthwhile that I think can be accomplished in a non-partisan way. Teaching how to register to vote, where to find a polling location, how to find out what's on your ballot. How to read ballot measures so you actually know what they do, and relevant local and state laws and ordinances. 

Your idea to scrap SS sort of misses the point of that program. It's not supposed to be your retirement, it's a safety net so that the elderly aren't destitute like they used to be. 

Time to reduce benefits for medicare and the elderly? No, that's not a moral policy. Instead of that confusing patchwork system we should have a universal system.

After the port arthur massacre in Australia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur_massacre_(Australia) - at the time the largest by a single gunman - the Australian government under Howard (funnily enough, a conservative) instituted reforms that has seen a dramatic drop in gun deaths and a decade without any mass shootings.

The simple fact is that there will always be members of the population who are beyond help. People lose it, and if they have easy access to weapons then there will continue to be mass shootings. Australia will have another one day, but were it not for the Howard reforms we would have had another already.

My problem with our knee-jerk reaction for more gun control is that millions of law-abiding citizens will be punished, and yet another constitutional right of ours will be regulated, all in the name of a false sense of peace. I realize that putting up signs that say 'Gun Free Zone' and adding another legal document to a file cabinet will help a few worried mothers sleep better at night, but all the evidence shows that will do absolutely nothing. It's the same reason the Bush administration was such a nightmare... the people give up so much to the government in the name of 'safety' and 'security', and we're left with nothing but regrets.

And WTF are you talking about? Murder-suicide? It's called vehicular manslaughter but the guy is being charged, as of now, with aggravated assault and endangerment. 

I'm simply exposing how ridiculous it is to think *taxes* are going to solve this problem. I mean come on. How would you defend your home from burglars? Paying higher property taxes?! LOL. 

Also, I'm not sure where your head is, but motor vehicle deaths/injuries almost always top the list of *causes* of injuries/deaths. [Here](http://www.justfacts.com/images/guncontrol/accidents_fatal-full.png) is a graph of fatal accidents in 2007. See where vehicles are? And see where firearms are? This is always the case. But you can't really vilify vehicles can you? 

It's all perception versus reality. It's like people who go to Red Robin, and order a double mega jumbo cheesy burger with chili cheese fries.....and a freaking *diet* coke, because they're watching their calories. I can literally take *anything* and turn it into something dangerous and bad and evil. Guns are just easy because yes, they *do* kill people. That's what they are in fact designed for. But *because* of that, *some* people like myself, see even clearer how dangerous they are and treat them as tools that have the ability to kill. That's all it is to me: a tool. A tool for self-defense. If someone, *anyone* thinks they are going to get in between myself and my family, my one and only family, they will be mistaken. *That's* why I have a gun. It's funny too, because some people hate guns, until they are raped/robbed/assaulted. Only then do they go out and get a gun. That's called reactive. I'm proactive. Is being proactive bad? 

EDIT: Oh and have you heard of cigarettes? They try to tax the living hell out of those things to deter smoking. How has that worked out? If they were planning on raising taxes on bullets, either in CT or the country, people (including myself) would simply go out and buy *a lot* of ammo and stock up. So actually you'd only really be putting *more* ammo on the streets. Just like how talking about an assault weapons ban has actually caused more assault weapons to be purchased. This is a much bigger issue, that cannot be solved by banning this, banning that, taxing that, banning this......It's about education, health (mental and physical), a good economy, and even society as a whole.

I don't have much time to type out a lengthy response but each of his points seems to be a little one sided.  For example:

1. 'Violent outliers being a normality' - I agree that this might be the case but I would argue, if that's the case why not work for reasonable gun legislation which can potentially reduce the fatalities in such incidents.  For example, in the Tuscon shooting, if the shooter had not been able to buy high capacity magazines at walmart a life or two might have been spared when he needed to reload (in fact the shooting ended when his gun jammed during reloading and was subdued).

2. 'Cultural issues' - Yes, I agree that we have a cultural problem here.  The problem is, statistics show that gun ownership and more guns in society alone is a contributing factor in gun violence.  You are far more likely to die by gun when you have a gun in your house (In MN recently a 4 year old accidentally killed his 2 year old sibling with an unsecured gun).  Additionally even the Police can inflict collateral damage, like in NY when officers wounded 9 people in a gunfight with one armed man.

3. 'Only a few murderous people' - Doesn't it also make sense to limit the availability of dangerous weapons to those murderous people that will inevitably fall through the cracks?  Why not put up reasonable barriers for people when purchasing guns that might catch a few of those people who have fallen through?  If murders are gonna happen, why make sure it's as easy as possible?

4. 'Mass shootings are in the minority of gun fatalities, most are by actual criminals' - But again, many of these crimes aren't carried out by ""criminals"", and once again, statistics show even among the law abiding, widespread gun ownership results in more gun violence.  Heck, Wayne LaPierre's own son fired a gun in anger during a road-rage incident.  Additionally there is a whole lot more suicides by guns and you are more likely to go through with a suicide if you own a gun..

Again, I'm not arguing that we should get rid of them, only that we have a conversation and try to find solutions to a very real problem.  I believe that we can enact reasonable laws that will leave guns available to those who want them and will do much to reduce the number of victims of gun violence.

I mean the fact that most of the mass shootings that we have had were carried out by people without a criminal record using legally obtained guns.  According to a Mother Jones study, in the 62 mass shootings they looked at more than 3/4 used legally obtained guns:  http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map

I don't know the statistics for gun violence at large but that's not what I was speaking about in my previous post.  Although, taking suicides into account I expect that the majority of gun deaths are via legally obtained weapons.  I could be wrong though, that's just speculation on my part.

As a related side note, Harvard has studied the link between gun ownership and homicide and has found that in general, more guns=more homicides:  http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/index.html

This is something I believe can be addressed through reasonable gun laws.

I'm not sure exactly why, maybe guns are seen as an easier method, maybe they are just more fatal so more succeed, maybe there is something in the psychology of gun owners.  Who knows, but there is a correlation in gun ownership and suicide.

I'm not a gun owner, and truth be told, I wouldn't mind if we got rid of them entirely.  I have had training with them and shot all kinds of guns (I'm actually a pretty good shot) but I honestly could take them or leave them.  That said, I recognize that there is no way to get rid of them in this country and that a lot of people are very staunch lovers of their guns.  Being a realist I instead want to support reasonable methods of control that allows those law abiding people to continue to own them while hopefully reducing the number of gun related deaths in this country.  I honestly believe we can do that.

That's not saying I only want to address our issues through gun control, it's merely one of the methods available to reduce violence.  There's a lot more that I think would help which we can leave for other conversations such as a more reasonable drug policy, easier access to mental health care and finding ways to ease the social stigma that goes along with it, figuring out ways to shift the culture away from glamorizing guns, violence and such, the list could go on and on.

(From the study)

""
Using data from 1981–2010 and the best firearm ownership proxy to date, the study found that for every 1 percent increase in gun ownership, there was a 1.1 percent increase in the firearm homicide rate and a 0.7 percent increase in the total homicide rate. This was after controlling for factors such as poverty, unemployment, income inequality, alcohol consumption, and nonhomicide violent crime. Further, the firearm ownership rate had no statistically significant impact on nonfirearm homicides, meaning there was no detectable substitution effect. That is, in the absence of guns, would-be criminals are not switching to knives or some other weapons to carry out homicide. ""

In any case that's the nail in the coffin. Do not let these guys get away with spewing talking points like  ""laws don't stop criminals from buying guns"" ""owning a gun deters criminals"" because there is tangible proof that it's bullshit. There's 0 evidence to back those claims up. Gun laws clearly work and owning a gun is more dangerous than not owning a gun it's an undeniable fact.

181,2,4o4po8,DisgruntledAmoeba,Liberal,Orlando nightclub shooting,1465951712,"I have been watching something peculiar occurring for quite some time now. It is a worrying phenomenon that I think all liberals should acknowledge. I have watched the rise of progressive politics and what effect it has been having upon the liberal constituency. I am going to show you the difference between liberalism and progressivism then suggest a theoretical idea to you that you should be worried about.

Firstly, we should acknowledge a list of contentions between progressivism and liberalism to see that these are two completely different ideologies. 

Ideologies have “socioeconomic units” which they use as the basis of their structure. For conservatives, that is the “interdependent individual.” For Italian fascists, it was the “nation.” For German fascists who imbibed racism into their ideology, it was the “Volk.” For socialists, it was the “proletariat.” So on and so forth, ideologies use different socioeconomic units. By changing the unit, you redefine the whole ideology. So let us look at what the different between progressives and liberals are in this regard.   Historically, liberals have believed in “individual” liberty. That serves as the basis of their ideological structure from which modern issues can be assessed. For the progressive, we see a far different story.

Starting with Karl Marx and his social conflict theory attempting to explain how society works, he thought that it was well explained by class warfare between the capitalists and workers. In more recent times, people like sociologists figured that this was not good enough to explain our circumstances. They expanded the category of class to include new categories such as race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, and more. In each of these categories, there are dominant groups and oppressed groups. Hence, white is the dominant race and minorities are oppressed; Christianity is the dominant religion and Islam is oppressed; heterosexuals are the dominant sexuality and transgenders are oppressed; males are the dominant gender and females are oppressed. Therefore, white heterosexual cis-gendered males are the dominant group or oppressor group. Sound familiar? The framework of thought, not free from criticism nor immune to being falsified, is the basis of modern identity politics. Later, it would lead to the popularity of interesectionality.

We have run across our first conflict. These identity groups of the progressives conflict with the socioeconomic unit of the liberals which is the 'individual' not the identity group. There are other contentions to note such as human nature. Liberals were the ones who acknowledged that human beings are economic animals and their nature is competitive. Progressives on the other hand place emphasis on other features of human beings such as their capacity to cooperate. That conception of human nature makes ideologies like communism possible. That is another conflict.

There are the economic contentions as well. Liberals have always believed in competitive markets. They have always acknowledged the reality that in an economic market, some people will do better than others. Hence, there will be gradations in society such as top 1% and bottom 1%. Progressives reject this. You see them rallying against the 1% and competitive markets in favor of redistribution of wealth and power to those “oppressed” categories. 

Look at free speech. Liberals have always been the defenders of free speech. There is now a new concept however called political correctness. That concept of political correctness is foreign to liberal doctrine. It originates in authoritarian regimes to silence political enemies. These days, progressives have revived it. A lot of liberals joke around because they think it means that you should simply be polite. On the contrary, it is political censorship. Look at Angela Merkel’s “hate speech laws” that are actually being used by the EU to censor the opinions of anti-immigration critics. Considering that the EU is in the midst of a massive migration experiment, is that not—in a free society with free speech—when we need those voices the most even if we do not agree with them? Instead, people are being shut down. The phenomenon has been occurring quite a bit on our college campuses where progressivism seems to be in abundant supply. This is not in line with liberalism. This is not in line with free speech.

Considering these contentions are at the root of these two ideologies, drawing the logical lines further on these ideologies results in philosophical conflicts across the entire board. These contentions are numerous and need not be discussed in full detail here. All that needs to be considered is that these two ideologies are completely different and conflicting every step of the way.

Now for the theoretical idea to suggest to you liberals. You are being hijacked by progressives. Your constituency is being co-opted by progressives influencing them to leave you for them. All of this is occurring in the guise of “working together” because your ideologies “appear” to share similarities such as moral values; kind of like how a virus has 'similar' receptors to attach to its host's membrane. The problem is however that these sharing of values are only a sleight of words. Take for instance, equality. Conservatives and libertarians hardly use or discuss the word equality. It is more of a liberal, progressive, or socialist word. To liberals, given their view on markets and competition, equality has always meant “equal opportunity.” To progressives however, given their emphasis on redistribution schemes and attacking the 1%, equality means “equal outcome.” That is why they put such emphasis on disparities between genders and races and see them as disparities at all rather than differences. Obviously, equal opportunity and equal outcome are opposite ideas. But, through the sleight of words and the magic of shared language, progressives can Trojan-horse the liberal constituency by suggesting that they “too” believe in equality. And so they may say, “don’t you also believe in equality?” If the word equality was suggested to a conservative or libertarian, they would suddenly be on guard because they know that the word is politically loaded with different definitions. Take for instance the word freedom, it means different things to George W. Bush and Ron Paul. Yet, the politician will stand on his podium and hammer the word “freedom” into the crowd without ever defining it. Language is just a single method of taking over ideological structures and making new converts to ideas they may have not investigated fully. People may be supporting something without realizing the full consequences.

The take-over has been very effective. A lot of Democratic party votes have shifted to Sanders who is well known to be sympathetic to progressives. He does not even define himself as a liberal. Yet the votes of ‘your’ constituency are going in his direction. A change has occurred in the liberal constituency and that change has been away from the principles of liberalism.

Then we put those metal boxes on the side of the road and leave them their for most of the day. If we had oil-burning trams everywhere, it would still be cheaper and more environmentally sound than hunks of electric-powered metal.

But anyway, just government = good, unbridled technocracy = bad.

Assault weapons are a legal category of weapons that fit a specific description, and only exist in a couple of states.

And you are right, it is ironic that the drum saved lives because that is not the intended purpose of a drum magazine.  The intended purpose is to be able to fire continously without interuption.  If it had done what it was built to do, he would have been able to kill far more people.

The reason I would expect the NRA to make some kind of a statement is because they advocate for less gun regulations.  They make that argument by saying that guns are reasonably safe and that the laws on the books are fine.  They also say that loose/no restrictions on guns don't lead to more violence.  I believe that this shooting is a prime example for why they are wrong and they have a responsibility to say why.

The NALSR's [stated goal](http://www.nalsr.com/aboutus.html?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=44) is to create more rules for an otherwise unsafe sport to promote safety and organization.

Also, he went to the only theater in the area that was openly a ""gun free zone"" in order to lessen the chance that someone would stop him.

One of the most important things when carrying a gun is knowing when NOT to use it. Even if someone draws a gun in a robbery or similar situation, this doesn't mean you should go all western shootout on the place. 

The best possible outcome would be for the criminal to take what he wants and leave peacefully. You give the police a great description of him and point out where he went. It's only when he's seriously threatening harm on the people there and you have a CLEAR LINE OF FIRE that you should think about even drawing your gun. It's way too easy to hit an innocent, even if you've had shooting practice, and even if you do hit him, there's weird things a bullet can do (hollowpoints are useful for making the bullet stop at the target).

Now, in situations where you've got a madman trying to gun down innocents, this changes a bit. You're no longer guaging the situation to see whether or not he/she has the intention to inflict harm on everyone - you know it's happening. Yes, adrenaline would be pumping and some mistakes may happen with inexperience, but I consider several citizens attempting to take down a gung-ho shooter better than him/her having free reign to mow down everyone in the room. Obviously the situation can varly wildly and it's not as simple as presented here, but I think common sense will tell you that there's not really a worse scenario than giving the shooter free reign to mow everyone down.

Is there a chance of someone retaliating and hitting an innocent bystander? Yes, of course there is. In the state I live in, Georgia, you can pretty much just carry around a handgun if you pay to get a permit (and you can do it in your property without one). They fingerprint you, make sure you're not a felon, and then mail you the permit. Now, I wouldn't think it outrageous to require some sort of test to ensure you are able to wield the gun safely without hurting yourself or other innocents. That sort of stuff can get complicated and expensive rather quickly, however, and I'm not one to propose an exact way to do that at the moment without more research.

So, how could this been prevented from happening? Sadly, that's really not known for sure to anyone. Although gun bans are a POSSIBLE deterrent to this type of behavior, I believe it's a very weak solution that has a very low chance of working with negative consequences that would likely far outweigh the benefits. Like it or not, America is saturated with guns, and that's not going away any time soon, even if owning a gun suddenly became the most illegal thing in the country. It's just so hard to know when someone will snap and it's usually up to the friends and family to help avoid something like that. If I had an idea to help those situations I'd share it for sure, but I don't. I just encourage people who see anyone in trouble to reach out and help them and don't care what others think about you for it.

Why? Well, for a myriad of reasons, least among them is that ""waging war on guns"" would be a serious breach of the Constitution.

Stricter gun laws won't mean that nobody has guns. It would just mean that now two sets of people are more likely to have guns not meant for sport: those that *really, really* want to shoot something, and criminals.

It's literally considered a privilege to own one, and even after you get through all the red tape and money you have to spend to just having one (Over $2000, not including the price of the firearm), you have to stand in front of a judge and convince him/her on the reason you need to have one (not want - just wanting one is no valid reason), and still, we had 1138 murders by firearm in 2011, and were up to over 900 this year. Criminals always find a way. My house was broken into last year by three individuals, with me and my whole family in it. They had us at gun point for 20 minutes, while they went through the rooms, taking everything they wanted. Police arrived an hour later. Could having a weapon prevented this situation? maybe, maybe not, but feeling so powerless was awful. I still feel powerless.

I really don't see a reason to have an assault weapon, aside from ""wanting one"". I was in the US ARMY, and there is no way I can think of that an M16 or an M4 can be used for home defense. 

What we need, in my humble opinion, is a stricter control on who can buy a firearm based on background checks and psychological evaluation. If I have a history of mental illness, or I don't pass a background check, I shouldn't be allowed to own a firearm, no matter the type. In the end, like what happens here in Puerto Rico, criminals get to ignore all of this. They don't care about the law, or the bans, or anything else. They'll find a way around anything we do, like they have done here in Puerto Rico.

There's way too little data in such a wide variety of situations on here to condense it down to "" law enforcement agents miss 75% of their shots fired in real situations"". The report also includes several things such as shooting at fleeing subjects and other situations that are not applicable to the mass murder situation. However, the report was useful and I had not seen it before. Thank you for sharing it. 


I do see your point and agree that someone going rambo has a slim chance of helping the situation, especially at range, although my previous point about the net gain in that situation still applies. I see where you're coming from, but I don't believe that there's any reason to discourage private citizens carrying guns in light of this report. As a matter of fact, life/death situations seem to spur higher accuracy (although this can be canceled out by a number of other conditions). Having multiple shooters was also advantageous.

Remember that a high amount of misses does not mean a group are poor shots. A single extended gun fight with lots of expended rounds can greatly skew that ratio. A lot of gun fights end up with little more than a few rounds fired (see city firearms discharge reports for more info and stats; SOP-9).

What I would like to see is evidence that an armed citizen, worst case ""going rambo"" and would likely contribute in a net negative way to the situation of a mass murder. For example: a shooter comes in to a public location and begins to gun down people. Before they get too far, several concealed carry shooters whip out their guns and begin to spray everyone. They happen to miss the actual shooter and kill more people than he ever could with the ammunition he had available to him. If you can present an argument where that is likely to happen and would outweigh the situations where the concealed carrier did stop the shooter and result in less loss of life, I would be willing to concede that stricter gun control laws would have a beneficial effect in situations like this.

Of course, if you have a solution to prevent the guns from getting in to the hands of disturbed individuals, I'm all for that too, but I don't see how that can possibly happen in the country we live in nowadays nor any time in the future.",Okay  I read it  and I m not really sure where you got that 75  of law enforcement officers miss all their shots from this  There s way too little data in,8.0,Th3Third1 8,OkayIreaditandImnotreallysurewhereyougotthat75oflawenforcementofficersmissalltheirshotsfromthisThereswaytoolittledatain,1868.605,2761.161
286,215,c7idmwz,robcantplayhockey,Liberal,Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting,1355809581,"Edit - My apologies: The poverty threshold has been updated, but I still believe they are still too low. The annual rate for a single person under 65 is still about $11k. 

Poverty is based on a specified amount of money that people are supposed to be able to live on.  At the following website, you'll notice that the poverty line was drawn in the 1960s and hasn't been updated.  Basically, they computed what a family in economic distress spent on food.  There's a big difference from then to today; here's the quote and the site:

""Poverty thresholds were originally derived in 1963-1964, using:

-U.S. Department of Agriculture food budgets designed for families under economic stress.
-Data about what portion of their income families spent on food.""


http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/measure.html

Horrific, IMO.

If you take a look at how much it really costs to live, the poverty line doesn't cut it. Morgan Spurlock (known for his TV show 30 days and documentary Supersize Me) did a great episode of 30 Days showing that even if you have a part-time job and live in the lowest rent district, it's impossible to make ends meet.  Part-time jobs usually have no health care benefits and don't account for other things families need like furniture, cleaning supplies, or other things of that nature.  Remember, food stamps don't cover these things. What happens if an emergency happens or a family member needs certain medical attention? I'm sure you're aware of how much a hospital visit can be.  I was in the hospital for 7 stitches to the arm; without insurance, I would've paid over $5000 for the 2 hours I was there.

As for regulation, welfare checks and other entitlements are being spent however the person pretty much wants.  A lot of people use them wisely, however, some do not.

I learned almost all of this from my college sociology teacher. It was truly a helpful and eye-opening class.

Do you think someone trying to defend thier property will be more likely to get a registered gun or one illegally? The reason for gun registration is to have the ability to track a gun in case it is used in a crime. There is nothing illegal about(well... not entirely true) defending your property. The people who get registered guns are jumping through all of the hoops to get one for self defence. On the otherhand, criminals want a cheap, fast way to obtain guns(to use in crimes) and they want to stay incognito so they get one illegally, sans registration. All gun control does is take guns from people trying to defend their rightfully owned property. Look at the Newtown shooting; The guy stole registered guns(it was the fault of the owner that they were not locked up), he then killed himself after murdering children. Now remember, he was not trying to evade the authorities since... you know... since he killed himself in all... But criminals try to evade the authorities to continue their activities and continue making cash money.

However, because most mass shooters don't have a criminal record before going on their rampage, they have access to firearms that would be fairly difficult to obtain illegally, e.g. semiautomatic rifles. Even so, because there's no way to background check for sanity, mass murderers will still be able to purchase and use regulated, legally purchased/owned firearms in their massacres. The best examples of this are the 2008 Cumbria shooting in England (a country with very strict gun control), where a man shot 23, killing 12, with double barreled shotgun and a .22, and the recent Norway massacre, where a madman obtained regulated firearms in a relatively anti-gun country.

Though it seems Obama does have the authority to bypass the restriction and he is choosing to do so by arming the Syrian rebels who have links to Al Qaeda, a group still listed as supporting terrorism.*

Well, according to the US code,  

&gt;""10 U.S. Code § 311 - Militia: composition and classes: 
(a) **The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.**
(b) The classes of the militia are—
(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and
(2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.

So basically, we're all ""the militia"".  

The founders also specified what they meant by militia in many of the Federalist papers.  Most notably,

&gt;“I ask, Sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people. To disarm the people is the best and most effectual way to enslave them.” – Speech in the Virginia Ratifying Convention, June 14, 1778

&gt;**“A militia when properly formed are in fact the people themselves… and include all men capable of bearing arms. . . To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of people always possess arms…** The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle.” – Letters From the Federal Farmer to the Republican, Letter XVIII, January 25, 1788

&gt;**“(W)hereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them nor does it follow from this, that all promiscuously must go into actual service on every occasion**. The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it.” – Federal Farmer, Anti-Federalist Letter, No.18, The Pennsylvania Gazette, February 20, 1788

&gt;“And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press, **or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms; or to raise standing armies, unless necessary for the defense of the United State**s, or of some one or more of them; or to prevent the people from petitioning, in a peaceable and orderly manner, the federal legislature, for a redress of grievances; or to subject the people to unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons, papers or possessions.” – Debates of the Massachusetts Convention of February 6, 1788; Debates and Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 1788 (Pierce &amp; Hale, eds., Boston, 1850)- George Washington

This is, objectively, the worst argument I commonly see in support of guns: the fact that other stuff *can be* lethal...

So much so that **toddlers have literally killed their adult caretakers by accident** - a mother and grandmother in two separate incidents just from the last 6 mo, just local to me.

&gt; Rational debate over guns in this country is clearly impossible.

That is very true when the gun control crowd refuses to have coherent discussions on the subject and/or attempts to sensor dissenting opinions from discussion forums. /r/gunsarecool and /r/guncontrol are great examples of that around here. But also, every gun control advocating group stifles discussion on their own pages and/or only posts opinion that tow the party line.


&gt; The average gun sold in this country will either be used to do something terrible and/or illegal (shooting an innocent person, being used in a crime, suicide), or, in the best case scenario, it will have a mundane existence, used only to shoot paper targets and nothing else.

I love the way they group firearms being used in a crimes along with target shooting, like they belong in the same group of uses. The fact is that the vast majority of firearms in this country will never be used in the commission of a crime or to murder anyone. And I feel pretty good about that. Is that fact supposed to belittle their possible use as a life saving tool? I've been a licensed driver for a couple decades and I've never once been in a situation where I needed my seatbelt, but you know what, I wear that wonderful thing every time I get in the car. I'm happy it's there and I'll be happy I was wearing it if the need ever arises. I feel the same away about the firearm I carry on my hip, the smoke/carbon monoxide detectors in my house, the locking gate on my property and the various safety equipment I wear at work.

There's a ton more in the linked article, but I don't have the time or patience to beat up on every paragraph. Just one more.


&gt; And, just like clockwork, the San Bernardino shooting led to a rush on gun stores, as mass shootings typically do. Having the symbols of their identity criticized makes conservatives defensive, and they go out and buy even more guns in a very expensive effort to reassert their identity.

Because it couldn't possibly be that responsible, independent thinking individuals would like to have the means to defend themselves or their loved ones if they happen to be in the vicinity of an evil person with intentions of committing evil acts. Attempting to convince americans that firearms have no legitimate purpose is one of the cornerstones of the gun control movement. Because if people realize that a firearm could one day save their lives, which it can, they might not be so likely to agree to banning them from this country.",Yeah  salon is pretty bad  here s my take from what they have to say   gt  Rational debate over guns in this country is clearly impossible  That is very true when,16.0,phantomofthezoo 16,YeahsalonisprettybadheresmytakefromwhattheyhavetosaygtRationaldebateovergunsinthiscountryisclearlyimpossibleThatisverytruewhen,1755.248,1724.074

I have a wife and three wonderful kids to get home to every night.

I also live in Texas. This means that, when I decided to get my firearm, it was nothing more than 24 hours, a 30 second ""background check"", an order on a website, and a 15 minute stop at the dealer to pick it up.

To get my conceal carry license, however, was months of painstaking process - multiple background checks, a LEGITIMATE, COMPETENT instructor, 14 hours of class time, hundreds upon hundreds of dollars, finger printing, etc etc etc.

When I first started looking into my conceal carry license, I found a website that offered something similar to what you see in the video here. There was a site where I could pay $25, watch 15 minutes worth of videos, get my ""went through training"" certificate, and mail it off to get my conceal license. It was through a Florida loophole just like this one that would make the conceal license I would have gotten valid in 30 something states. I opted NOT to do this, as I didn't agree with it, and went with what I considered the right and proper procedure - an actual class, proper training and safety classes, proper identification, etc.

Not having a conceal license isn't going to stop someone from shooting up a school or an office, so maybe the hard part should come WHEN WE BUY THE GUNS. Secondly, I recognize that there are issues with the conceal laws. The loopholes exist for a reason, and they need to be eliminated. Does this mean that concealed carry is a bad idea? Absolutely not: it's just badly IMPLEMENTED in this country. This video, to me, doesn't say ""f*** the good guy with a gun scenario, its a bunch of crap"".

To stay on topic to the original comment, I think it's extremely misguided to alienate an entire religion and it's followers when a plurality or a majority are sensible, ethical, compatible with western culture, and speaking out against these atrocities. These are the exact people who are our only hope for communicating and spreading their understanding of what it means to be a muslim and teaching the exact reasons why these atrocities are *not okay*. Because a thousand redditor's can put on their religious studies expert hats and say that their holy book condones it all, the reality is there are just as contradicting verses that clearly state those act are un-Islamic. It comes down to interpretation... not unlike Christianity and how it has evolved from barbarism. This is why there are so many different sects of Islam and why some are profoundly peaceful and compassionate, and some are Wahhabi's committing unspeakable violence and somehow becoming the ""face,"" of Islam to the rest of the world.

It makes no sense to lump all muslims into the same category as Wahhabi's. Aside from it completely ignoring something we all learned in grade school - the fallacy of judging an entire group of people by the actions of a percentage of them - aside from that it's just counterproductive. We should be recognizing upstanding Muslims in our communities who live peaceful lives, accept others beliefs, and often serve their community all while keeping their faith close to them. To tell them ""you are part of the problem unequivocally,"" when you know nothing about their personal beliefs or interpretations would be incredibly destructive and if anyone still has the ability to empathise, you should try to imagine what it would be like to be living a peaceful life, taking care of your family and trying to get by like everyone else and suddenly becoming the target of hate and aggression and being told that *you,* own some blame in the killing of thousands and thousands.

More muslims have died fighting ISIS than any other demographic. More muslims have been killed at the hands of ISIS than any other demographic. Conscientious Muslims are a critical part of any solution - they're not all one monolithic bad guy and painting them as such is a huge step in the wrong direction.

I see so much shit parroted on reddit and it's unfortunate that it's reaching the tipping point where ignorant bigotry and villainizing is the norm.

By the way, to see a real life example of why this is a terrible idea, look at France (not just recent France,) - one of the most difficult places for muslims to assimilate, one of the places they are most discriminated against and criticized, and the most disenfranchised. They now also have one of the highest home-grown terrorism rates of any country. It is inexcusable to commit acts like that, but the reality is when kids grow up being told their the bad guy and being treated like shit, it makes a recruiters' task of convincing them the west is evil a lot easier.

Things like background checks, waiting periods, the removing the ability to buy assault rifles or extended magazines. The idea that we as liberals are trying to outright ban guns is either a misunderstanding on your part or an attempt at a straw-man.

&gt;As for my NRA koolaid, this discussion isn't about accidents or spurs of moments. It's about terrorists and spree-shooters

Spree-shooters would not be able to spree-shoot if they didn't have access to guns. Where is a high school burnout who decides he wants to shoot up his school going to get guns? Or how about you ask the empirical question of where this person got his guns.
 
&gt;And, no: there's no piddly bureaucratic law that's going to stop folks like pretty much any of those that we've seen so far from acquiring whatever guns they want. (Not even in France, with their gun-control utopia.) 

So just to be clear are you auguring that France has as many mass shootings as we do?

&gt;Suicidal mass-murderers aren't going to give a damn about violating some gun-control misdemeanor.

No they won't but it's not about charging them with a misdemeanor my friend its about preventing them from acquiring them in the first place which they will be unable to do with so much ease. 

But by all means continue to believe in your misinterpretation of the 2nd amendment - Try to think about when and why the constitution was ratified. Your NRA platitudes because there is not a damn thing anyone can tell you to convince you otherwise. But please try not to think to hard why you should be allowed to buy assault rifles at the next gun show without a back ground check, but somehow don't have a problem with keeping civilians from buying tanks or rail guns you head might explode.

&gt;Even if that were true, there are plenty of stabbings, beatings, burglaries, etc. that happen to good people that would probably still be alive if they could fight back in countries that abhor the concept of self-preservation.

Most of which people survive. Gunshots are often much more deadly. (Oh, and it is true, by the way.) Another problem with your statement is that most countries where strict gun laws are in effect, overall crime rates are below those in the US. 

&gt;It's a means for a terrorist to accomplish the task. There are alternate methods. Not to mention one can pull another Paris and smuggle in arms. Or make them.

Nobody is pretending that you can stop *all* violence. Gun control is meant to reduce, not eliminate, gun violence.

&gt;Oh here comes the emotional appeal.
&gt;Look, it's a tragedy but that doesn't mean people should relinquish their individual liberties that protect them others and from the government.

You do realize that not everyone thinks that shooting someone else is something we are morally responsible to do, right? I mean, it may be your right to defend yourself from a home invader with a gun, but others may choose to get a dog, a better lock, or a tazer instead. And for the love of democracy, can you please stop with the ""we have to defend ourselves from the government"" line? The government of who? North Korea? 

It seems to me that an appeal to patriotism is on equal ground with those that appeal to emotion.

&gt;It seems like after major event like 9/11 or a shooting people are quick to lose their rights. That's not a good thing.

When an innocent person's life is taken away from someone who was used their right to own a firearm for evil, yes, some people think that people who chose to exercise those rights should come under tighter scrutiny. Gun rights advocates like to say guns don't kill people, people kill people. They are correct. So we should do everything we can to deter people from killing other people. If you remove or restrict the tools used to do commit violence, you end up with less violence. It's not rocket science.

&gt;No it's not because those Americans couldn't lawfully carry in that Orlando bar for self-protection because of the fundamentally flawed gun laws in this country.

First, we live in a free society. A free society should not require every citizen to own and carry a firearm to maintain law and order. Second, Florida gun laws (like most in the country) are very lax:

* No license required to purchase
* No registry whatsoever
* No restrictions on magazine capacity or assault-style weapons
* Concealed carry is legal
* No background checks for private sales

And yes, Florida does restrict concealed carry in a bar.... *where they serve alcohol.* I agree that the existing set of laws are very flawed, but I have a feeling we agree for different reasons.",I am not OP  but you re just plain wrong on so many counts   gt Even if that were true  there are plenty of stabbings  beatings  burglaries  etc  that happen to good,4.0,schm0 4,IamnotOPbutyourejustplainwrongonsomanycountsgtEvenifthatweretruethereareplentyofstabbingsbeatingsburglariesetcthathappentogood,1745.689,3021.092

Since knives have a purpose other than killing, yes, guns represent the greater threat and therefore more focus. Also, do you really think that someone who wants to go murder a bunch of first graders is going to get away with it using a knife? Of course not. The reason guns are so deadly is that they were designed to be that way. You can stop a person from stabbing you. You can't stop a bullet from hitting you.

&gt;Give me some statistics. I want to see Brazil vs. U.S. And it needs to be per capita.

http://www.cfr.org/society-and-culture/us-gun-policy-global-comparisons/p29735

Sure, you can cherry pick the outliers, but the fact remains that most first world countries have strict gun control and low crime rates (per capita) compared to the US.

&gt;In what situation? The only time you are legally able to is when your life is in danger. You can be a pacifist all you want but the vast majority of people are into self preservation.

That's not true, Stand Your Ground and Castle Doctrine are two very basic scenarios on how you can legally kill someone without your life being in danger at all.

&gt;List of countries that took guns and turned on their citizens, killing millions:

&gt;Nazi Germany
&gt;USSR
&gt;Cambodia
&gt;Ottoman Empire
&gt;Rwanda
&gt;Uganda

If Nazi Germany and Rwanda are the best you can come up with, I think we're pretty safe. :)

&gt;Then that person will be put away for life, but should we judge an entire group of law-abiding people for what a small number of assholes do?

Yes. We don't allow rape, murder, or kiddie porn even though it's only a small number of assholes that decide to do it. The same applies to, well, pretty much every criminal law ever made.

&gt;Okay so let's ban knives, cars, fertilizer, hammers, ice picks, saws...

All of those things were not designed to kill. They are tools first, weapons second. A gun is a weapon only.

&gt;It doesn't say 'require' in the 2nd.

You said everyone would ""lose"" their rights, which isn't true. Only those who use guns. 

&gt;We have police, but sometimes the police don't do their jobs. Some even oppress people. There's not enough of them to protect every person. They're not even legally responsible for protecting people.
&gt; Hell, there was an officer on the scene at the gay club but he didn't engage the shooter. He waited for SWAT.

As he should have, the dude had an *AR15 and a pistol and tons of ammo and the element of surprise!* You are entirely correct, we should not have to live in a society where we rely on a SWAT team to take out criminals. If we didn't have guns everywhere, it wouldn't be a problem. Hell, most of the UK is policed by officers with nothing more than batons and they do just fine.

&gt;Then it should be handled case by case if someone used a gun in bars. Like how most things are handled in the courts.

&gt;""Was this person intoxicated?""

&gt;""No he had one beer, and shot the jealous ex-boyfriend who attacked his girlfriend with a knife.""

Semantics aside, what the modern American ""left"" advocates economically is not equal outcome in the sense of some sort of we're-all-equal communism, but rather an adjusted outcome based on the failures of capitalism and the free market system we employ. Personally, I feel that modern liberals look at issues rather than ideologies, with conservative thought being just the opposite.

Take for example the gender pay gap, *including unequal work*. The liberal looks at the situation and thinks, ""simply by being born female you are destined to a life of 3/4 the wealth of a male"". Of course everyone agrees about equal pay for equal work, but the progressive liberal takes it a step further and desires an adjusted outcome so that women can prosper just as much as men. I don't entirely agree with this as I feel that, like you mentioned, looking at identity politics is not as productive as looking at economic class, but I understand that there are many liberals out there that support things like affirmative action.

On the other hand, the conservative looks at the gender pay gap and retreats back to ideology. ""They are not doing the same work"" they will say, and follow it with ""it is their choice to not enter the sciences and take jobs that pay less"". Free market capitalism is largely infallible to the conservative, and when problems do arise, the solution is consistently that individual behavior needs to change to fit the rules of the system.

There is a necessary suffering associated with unregulated capitalism, as people invariably fail to adjust to the rules either through no fault of their own, *or because of their own misguided behavior*. Take the 80 year old who did not properly save for retirement and must work until his death or until his family takes him in, if he has that support. The conservative looks at him and says, you did not plan your life appropriately and now you are suffering the consequences of your own actions. The liberal, looking at the well being of the entire group, says ""we are seeing many elderly people that were unable to save for retirement and are suffering as a result - we as a people would like to solve this issue by supporting our elderly financially"".

Anyways, much of this economic debate is going to be a moot point soon when we reach a post-scarcity world with largely automated labor. If we look at the big picture, there was a point in the past when any job automation was replaced 1:1 with new jobs, often times better than that. We have already past the point where job automations are not being replaced equally, and in the (not so) distant future, virtually 100% of jobs will be automated. The ability to transition through this period peacefully and prosperously will be done through a liberal and progressive vision of society, where all people are treated equally and wealth is shared with the community. I hope someday you will join us.",You seem to be highlighting the differences between classical liberalism and modern liberal   progressive ideologies  Semantics aside  what the modern American  left  advocates economically is not equal outcome in,6.0,joephusweberr 6,YouseemtobehighlightingthedifferencesbetweenclassicalliberalismandmodernliberalprogressiveideologiesSemanticsasidewhatthemodernAmericanleftadvocateseconomicallyisnotequaloutcomein,2699.528,2121.043

In recent decades more and more 'Evangelical' pastors and churches having been come from Central America. Which in itself isn't a bad thing HOWEVER in the last 5 or 10 years we've seen a greater number of what we might call 'cult' or just plain bizarre or weird ones popping up.

Many in the congregation will be made of illegal aliens but also legal ones and some 1st generation Americans and they are often who sponsored the pastors to work in the USA. These groups are sometimes kooky mix-n-matches too.. think 'televangelist' then some Mormonism, some Jehovah Witness, some 'charismatic catholic'. 

In much of their culture things like homosexuality are considered low, degrading, abominations. Or worthless or they may even believe it brings curses on the community, country and environment. Ala Sodom &amp; Gomorrah. 

So, again, while I know its your prejudice to blame homosexuals I'd say in this case you will find its coming more from a kind of obscure Hispanic 'cult' or aberrant and probably separated denominational group. 

The good thing is that Hispanic Churches will often 'watchdog' their own circles and call it out, condemn them if necessary:

-*""These comments, applauding the death of innocent people, are completely contrary to the Bible's teaching and God's heart…. His statements do not represent Jesus nor hundreds of Sacramento pastors whose hearts have been broken and are praying for the loved ones so tragically affected by this cowardly act.""*

but its not so easy.. sometimes these sorts of wacky splits from Central/South America get really intense (even thought it might be only 30 of them total) and who knows.. they probably have Armageddon prophecies or some wacky things.

Oh.. other good news. As bizarre as these aberrant groups might sound/talk or preach about ... in fact they are generally entirely harmless and don't even like to evangelize as much as you might think. They tend to be very 'exclusive' and almost enjoy being the only ones to know about their crazy ideas.

Its not supposed to take longer than 30 days( Illinois budget problems sometimes make that questionable but mine was 10 days). You send a picture of yourself, they ask a couple questions, lying on them is a felony and responded to pretty harshly. I believe there is a background check as well. You pass those they send you a card with said picture. Firearm dealers have to see before they sell you a gun. 

I can't remember exactly how much I paid, it was like 10-15 bucks though. How about buying a gun requires you to have a gun card? It doesn't mean you own one, it means your capable of doing it. 

Does everyone follow it? God no, but for example someone can drive across the border if they get denied in Illinois to Indiana to a gun show and walk out with one. 

I'm assuming if your buddy is hunting he's got a hunting license. If he gets a hunting license for guns, you could have DNR verify that they're good. No issues where they got the gun. 

Going to a gun show and they sell guns make the people buying one show the card and another picture ID. It's not uncommon for alcohol purchases to go through that process. 

Obviously there's going to be plenty of areas where people can slip through the cracks. If people want them that badly they'll find ways to get them. And a lot of guns already out there in hands who aren't qualified to get them. That doesn't mean to do just do nothing. If somethings bleeding you don't say ""fuck it, I've bled a lot already may as well let it bleed and stop trying to protect myself from any more cuts.""

Due process for people on the terror watch lists? There are people who have been held in Guantanamo for less for 15 years. Yeah, those people on that list are a little SOL. That's also a very small fraction of people who want guns. 

As for the other point, you have freedom of speech. That freedom doesn't include the freedom to yell fire in a crowded theater. That doesn't give the freedom of known pedophiles to speak to children unsupervised. You can't threaten someone harm, you can't slander someone. So yeah there are limits on certain parts of the 1st amendment. 

Another clear distinction; freedom of speech is a human right. Not only established by the US but by the UN. You know what's not on that list? Gun ownership. To equate the two is outlandish.

Last thought is that the US hardly has unfettered access to guns for everyone no matter who they are.

The Democratic Party held a 15 hour filibuster to push for a vote on 2 propositions.  The first was to prohibit those on the terror watch list from buying firearms.  And the second was yet another redundant mandate to require background checks.  

Republican Congressmen proposed 2 compromises. The first was a proposal to allow the attorney general to deny the purchase of a gun for 3 days.  The second was a check of power that would require  the Attorney General to submit the Terror Watch List to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Center.  

----

The proposals of the Democratic Party are contrary to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.    

&gt;Fifth Amendment: ""No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.""  

[Here is a good explanation of the V Ammendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment) 

&gt;Fifteenth Amendment: Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""
&gt;Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.""
&gt;Section 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.""
&gt;Section 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.""
&gt;Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.""

Here are 2 good explanations of the XIV Amendment: 
[1](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=43) 
[2](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fourteenth+amendment) 

----

The 5th Amendment prohibits the denial of rights to people on terror watch lists because it would be violating their right to ""due process.""

The 14th Amendment prohibits the denial of those on the watch list from buying weapons because the Federal Government has to provide ""equal protection under the law.""

*Psychological Vulnerabilities and Propensities
for Involvement in Violent Extremism*- 

""Research on the psychology of terrorism has argued against the idea that most terrorist
behavior is caused by mental illness or by a terrorist personality. This article suggests
an alternative line of inquiry
–
an individual psychology of terrorism that explores
how otherwise normal mental states and processes, built on characteristic attitudes,
dispositions, inclinations, and intentions, might affect a person
’
s propensity for
involvement with violent extremist groups and actions. It uses the concepts of
“
mindset
”
–
a relatively enduring set of attitudes, dispositions, and inclinations
–
and worldview as
the basis of a psychological
“
climate,
”
within which various vulnerabilities and propensi-
ties shape ideas and behaviors in ways that can increase the person
’
s risk or likelihood of
involvement in violent extremism.""

*Is Violent Radicalisation Associated with Poverty,
Migration, Poor Self-Reported Health and Common
Mental Disorders?-*

""People with poor health, migrants, and older people were
more likely to condemn violent radicalisation. Discrimination,
poverty, social and health inequalities, political engagement
and attitudes to foreign policy were not relevant.""

This study was based in the UK, though, so I'd like to see more domestic (US focused) research too. They also don't completely discount the role that mental illness could play.

I did my first degree (law) in Europe, where a mandatory course was legal history. A significant chunk was dedicated to the huge impact the Age of Enlightenment had on the criminal justice system. Gradually the courts moved from church run to civilian run. 

Subsequently a significant debate was had on what the purpose of criminal justice was. The outcome of that debate was that the focus shifted away from punishment (especially punishment of amoral behavior) to serving the best interests of society by focusing on prevention and rehabilitation.

Years later, after having returned to the US, I met a leading philosophy professor and asked him why the US criminal justice system still seemed so focused on punishment, and hadn't evolved like European courts to primarily focus on prevention and rehabilitation. He answered that the US had never had a full reception of the Age of Enlightenment philosophy. Yes, when it came to establishing the Constitution the founding fathers primarily relied on AoE philosophers. But beyond this limited domain where the tools of AoE were deployed the philosophy itself and the tools it generated were never really taken onboard.

Maybe even track the guns with GPS implants to reduce the second market.

Guns are are making all of us less safe and isn't that the opposite of what they are supposed to do? There are so many guns that police are afraid of getting shot by citizens so they are reacting to minor situations with deadly force. Huge mass shootings every few months. The most gun deaths of any civilized society. But it's like the gun people can't even see any of this going on. They stick their fingers in their ears and go, ""La la la la! Can't hear you, its mental health, guns don't kill people, tree of liberty, na na na na"". 

 If *anyone* should be working hard to enact sensible gun legislation it's the very people who use guns and want to preserve gun rights. You should be the ones who worry the most every-time someone gets shot, not just about the people affected but also about the P.R. hit your beloved hobby or form of defense is going to take. It's the unwillingness to budge a single inch on antiquated gun rights that has led to this untenable situation that's getting so bad that it feels like the only solution is to ban guns.

I hope we don't have to do it, but I think the only way to get compromise is for those like me who have been on the fence to form an equal and opposite force to the NRA and support a full ban. I think that's the only way we'll ever get any compromise at all. 

Not to be sexist but realizing now you're female gave me a thought. Its unfortunate we couldn't make it so only the females get to have guns. I could see there being a lot of benefits to that.

Go to any study and you’ll see this is a lie. Canada has roughly 30 firearms per 100 people, USA has roughly 90 firearms per 100 people. Where did you get the idea canada has more guns per capita than the US? In fact, the US has the most guns per capita than any other country on earth. USA is #1 in firearm ownership on all fronts. THAT is a fact. How can you expect me to take you seriously when you clearly haven’t done any research?

You think Canada has less shootings because they have less crazy people per capita? even this guy, clearly unfit to purchase a firearm, passed a background check even tho he assaulted another student and got expelled for it, and had the police to his residence several times for domestic disturbances. It’s pretty damn obvious he wasn’t okay to access something like an AR-15. How could we make it much more obvious? Mass surveillance? Feds will use this as a tool to spy on us, that’s where I think this is going. We don’t even need to get rid of all the guns! In canada you can still get a gun, you know. It’s not “take all the guns”. It’s common sense gun control. 

Canadian govt. doesn’t mass surveil, it has WAY LESS GUNS PER CAPITA THAN USA, and they have far less gun issues. It’s not rocket science!! This is north america, people. 

The US has double the guns per capita than Finland and Switzerland, the countries with most firearms per capita in Europe.

Felons, anyone convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor, drug users, adjudicated ""mentally defective"" or involuntarily committed to a facility, and more are flatly prohibited from possessing arms. 

There are regulations about use, storage, storage of ammo, transport, and a lot, lot more.

The interpretation of the Second Amendment at its inception was that of an individual right.  We had very few national gun laws until the '20s, and none of those prohibited ownership.  The interpretation of the Second Amendment started getting changed with a 1942 1st Circuit (Cases v. United States) opinion that decided a Supreme Court decision didn't mean what it said and then invented the ""collective right"" nonsense.

Where someone is reasonably suspected (probable cause) of being such, it's reasonable to temporarily deprive them of arms until due process can occur.  

It's no reasonable to say a rifle is legal if it has a wood stock, but illegal if it has a black stock.  It's not reasonable to say semi-automatics are illegal. They're not machine guns (which, btw, aren't illegal).  

Permits for carry are reasonable.

At the very least, I'd rather gun ranges be the sole owners and keepers of AR-15's. The public can come and shoot them, but nobody gets to take any home.

Never owned a firearm but always been in favor of empowering people with the right to own a firearm. I've since come to support full reform of gun laws if not repealing the second ammendment.

In ancient Rome and pretty much all ancient civilizations the government would not allow for citizens to buy and sell weapons. Even in that scenario the populous is fully capable of bringing down a government with or without it being fully armed, as history shows us, so the argument that the citizens need to be armed in order to keep the government from being oppressive sounds good but I don't buy it any longer.

As for people who hunt for sport and game, why would any hunter need a semi-automatic rifle? He wouldn't. In fact, what's the scenario where ANY citizen needs to own a semi-automatic rifle? There simply isn't one. Why not ban semi-automatic rifles then? I heard 2 of my state representatives recently in media separately come out and say that if you enact ANY gun restricting laws then it's a slipperly sloap and eventually all guns will be taken away. Do they really believe that, or was that just a convenient answer, or was it for the fact that the NRA has given millions of dollars to many congressmen effectively buying out their opinion? No matter the answer, that ain't right.

And the politicians give the answer after a mass shooting ""let's not politicize this."" you're a politician, you have literally one job: to politicize events affecting the populous. But it isn't the democratic politicians that cry foul when mass shootings happen, no it's only one party that does that.

The ability for citizens to buy and sell weapons has gone on for so many centuries in this country that even ""bad guys"" can own firearms now, so the need to own guns is self-fulfilling: good guys need to have guns because bad guys have guns. If we hadn't empowered people from the earliest days with the right to own weapons then bad guys would only have knives, hammers, etc to perform criminal acts with.

The idea of empowering citizens with firearms sounds good, but in practice it is just a powder keg waiting to be lit given enough time, which is where we are now and I don't know what the solution is because the reality of a fully armed population, good and bad, stable and unstable, exists now.

""specially trained""

By ... who? 

Who designs the training. On what criteria? To what standards? No, don't just say, ""the local police department"" or something similar. This training would have to specially designed because you're talking about non-professionals with guns in a building full of panicked children AND those ""specially trained people"" will be very likely facing a CHILD with a gun who is killing other children. We don't train soldiers for that. We don't train cops for that. So we're going to need special training, including not just the mechanics and theory of combat arms, but the psychology of killing a CHILD in an active shooter situation. If you don't understand why this is a problem, then you're very likely unqualified to be in this conversation in the first place. It takes years of training to condition a soldier to kill another human being on command, let alone a child. And when that killing occurs, it's usually in a warzone, alongside your squadmates, and while that engagement is very, very often chaotic, it can't be compared to the confusion and chaos of a building packed with screaming running children that you are supposed to be protecting. In a warzone, if your bullets hit a civilian, even a child, well, that's collateral damage. It happens. It can't NOT happen. That's war. But a school? Full of American kids? You starting to see why you'd need some VERY, VERY specific training? 

Who pays for it? Combat arms is a perishable skill, so how often is refresher training and re-qualification mandated? 

Who do these ""specially trained people"" answer to? Are they trained to work together? Or are they Lone Wolf McQuade? 

How do you insure the school in this situation? 

Because you going to HAVE to insure the school. 

Are the specially trained people personally liable for their fire? If they hit an innocent kid, if they kill an innocent kid or cripple him or her for life? Who's responsible for that? 

Moreover, is the ""specially trained person"" responsible for failure to stop an active shooter?

Well? 

No. No. Don't roll your eyes. You live in America (most of you). We are a litigious society. Somebody has to be responsible. You were trained. You had a gun. You failed to stop the shooter, when the grieving parents sue you, will the school board pay your legal fees? Or will the the school, school board, state take responsibility? 

SOMEBODY has to be legally responsible.

What weapons? 

It makes a difference, you know. Larger, high velocity rounds can penetrate body armor, but also walls, doors, etc, meaning increased chance of collateral damage in a building full of children. We made the cockpit doors on commercial aircraft bullet proof, are we going to do that with classrooms? If not, well, we're back to that question of who's responsible when the school gets sued for not protecting the students from stray bullets fired by their own teachers. 

So, do you mandate acceptable weapons? Ammunition? Fields of Fire? Zones of responsibility. Or is it the Wild West?

How do the cops know who the licensed and qualified ""specially trained people"" are? 

This hole is bottomless. 

You are essentially talking about turning teachers into soldiers and schools into warzones. You would do everything, EXCEPT address the actual problem. Easy availability of high powered weapons of war. 

Now look, I did not say there shouldn't be armed guards in schools. I didn't say there should. 

Likewise, I didn't say teachers shouldn't be armed. Or that they should. 

Instead, I asked some VERY basic questions regarding the proposed idea of allowing or even mandating armed teachers and school personnel. 

I used to do this for a living. I've had advanced training and extensive experience in this area. I was trained by both military and civilian schools. I taught combat arms. I'm a gun owner. I have a concealed carry permit. I'm hardly anti-gun. I didn't suggest anything, one way or the other. Instead, I'm asking BASIC questions about this idea of arming up teachers and putting amateurs with guns in schools. Questions that any competent gun operator should ask.  

You want to put more guns, carried by amateurs, into a building packed full of children.

Gun rights plays into this in multiple ways, so it is a perfect tool for republican leaders to simultaneously stimulate their followers to action and keep them in their place.

The most direct fear stimulated by gun rights is fear of not being able to protect your family and property in case of attack. On top of that, you have the second-level fear of Democrats taking away your guns. Then you get to conspiracy types of fears -- that Democrats want to disarm the public because they want to have a violent revolution of some kind. And it goes on.

Gun rights is absolutely the perfect issue for republican leaders because it allows them to use coded language to stoke all these fears. Though a very significant majority if the population, including the majority of republican voters, want to see additional levels of gun control, the value of this issue to foment the fear they rely on to stay in power makes it worth the risk of backlash for republican leaders.

It is disappointing that the actual police on the scene also held back &amp; took no action, but it is not unreasonable that the 51-year-old 'School Safety Officer' didn't.

As for the actual cops, their actions seem part of a larger problem, where their commitment to going home at the end of their shift out-weighs their commitment to public service which is definitely part of what they sign up for.

The bigger issue is what are you supposed to do in the face of superior fire-power?

I want to believe I would’ve gone in but in reality it’s a lot to ask of someone who may or may not have sufficient training in how to handle it. 

Obviously go towards the gunfire but what if it stops, do you clear room by room, can you be sure it’s over? Can you be sure who did it? Do you check every kid, clear every room? 

Learning from this incident, is training for this scenario adequate? Should we be better preparing school officers for this scenario? In the event there’s hostages or multiple shooters, 

I’m not sure about other schools but if this happened at the high school I went to, the hallways would be a nightmare. People running, the noise, it’d offer little to no cover. The ricochet that the walls would create, getting a clear shot at the shooter would’ve been a very tall order. 

Becoming a police officer though, you know it comes with the territory. It’s your responsibility to protect others and you may be asked to risk you’re safety and life one day, if you’re not prepared to do that, don’t join. 

I don’t believe how Trump called him a coward was appropriate. He made a rational and logical decision to not run in there. 

I just think it deepens the argument that regulations on guns need to be stricter.

Incomplete thought here, going to assume that you just left off the word ""situations"". Police, or anyone else attempting to fire at someone through a barricade would be extremely irresponsible, ever hear of being sure of your target and what's beyond it? Regardless, as a civilian a barricaded hostile is your opportunity to escape. 

&gt;Also, anything that isn’t a bolt action or pump is semi automatic.

Breech action, lever action, full automatic, and revolvers are just made up? 

&gt;A glock is semi automatic, so is an ar-15, but not an ak.

AKs come in semi auto. 

&gt;So when you say that semi automatic guns are not an appropriate defense, how about in any situation that is at a greater range than that if a shotgun? In that scenario, a semi automatic PISTOL is very often used.

A pistol is no one's choice at long range, you were just discussing rifles and completely dropped the ball. A 12 gauge with slugs has an effective range of about 125 yards, what defensive situation are you imagining that exceeds that range where you aren't simply better off running/hiding? 

You seem to have a really odd view of what guns are and are not, what they're useful for, and what situations they can be effective in. Here's hoping it's just internet talk.

OVERPOPULATION: *It's going to destroy it all. I use what I call my bathroom metaphor. If two people live in an apartment, and there are two bathrooms, then both have what I call freedom of the bathroom, go to the bathroom any time you want, and stay as long as you want to for whatever you need. And this to my way is ideal. And everyone believes in the freedom of the bathroom. It should be right there in the Constitution. But if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing. You have to set up, you have to set up times for each person, you have to bang at the door, aren't you through yet, and so on. And in the same way, democracy cannot survive overpopulation. Human dignity cannot survive it. Convenience and decency cannot survive it. As you put more and more people onto the world, the value of life not only declines, but it disappears. It doesn't matter if someone dies*. (Isaac Asimov)

What regulations would those be then? Considering the UK tried regulation leading to banning. Now they need “KNIFE... regulation” because the violence didn’t stop. 

The problem is solved in two places. 
1. At home. Discipline your damn kid and teach them respect for other human life. Im heavily conservative and with that being said, i think liberals are absolutely bat shit crazy. HOWEVER, i would never allow my kid to grow up thinking that, or any other reason should warrant any sort of initiation of violence to anybody. No matter who they are or what the situation. 

2. At School. I witnessed teachers when i was in school brush off bullying so many times it made me want to put a hole in their wall. Bullying needs to be taken far more seriously than this bs system schools have now. Teachers need to make a bigger effort to reach out to kids effected and confronting bullys. How they arent immediately expelled by now is beyond me. Lessons need to be learned.

My point being: the issue is simply just shitty human beings. Thats something that is never going to change. No lifeless object being ignorantly banned will fix that. Idk what is so hard about blaming lack of accountability. But that alone is the answer. If you cant prevent something, all you can do is be as prepared as humanly possible to stop it and deal with it if the situation arrives. The threat will never go away and thats a fact.

Gun regulation saves lives, in the same way car regulation saves lives. I found out (in a separate debate) that Americans don't know what proper car regulation looks like. So just to clarify, when a non-American refers to control, they mean requiring a licence to sell, own, operate, store, etc applied nationally with no exceptions. Usually modelled on some other country with effective gun control.

Car regulation doesn't prevent law abiding citizens from driving cars.

Ok, but he was in his own garage listening to music.  Is it illegal to be drunk in your own home?

&gt; Another factor prompting the attorney to seek a new trial is that the defense mentioned Hill was on probation for drug possession, which Phillips feels was meant to vilify Hill, as Newman had no way of knowing this when he responded. Hill's probation was also set to ""automatically terminate"" 11 days before his shooting, he said.

He was on probation for drug possession.  He was in his own home, in his own garage.  Even if owning a gun was breaking his probation it is not ok to kill him.  This news came after the shooting, his probation had no influence on the shooting itself.  What is the purpose of it in the trial other than to vilify somebody?

&gt; The bullet from the first shot got stuck in the door, Phillips said. The second and third hit Hill in the abdomen, and the fourth struck Hill's head, he said. Lopez did not open fire.

&gt;Not realizing Hill was dead, the deputies called for a SWAT team and snipers, according to the lawsuit. They kicked in doors and cut holes in the garage door, the suit claimed.

&gt;""Deputies shot tear gas canisters into the Hill home through many windows while severely damaging the windows and interior of the home and leaving toxic tear gas residue in the home,"" the lawsuit said.

&gt;Once inside, officers found Hill dead with an unloaded handgun in his back pocket, not his hand, court records show.

So he had a gun on him and the call was for a noise complaint that escalated to an officer shooting 4 times through a door and then calling swat and tear gassing the house.  That seems a bit overkill for a guy who had an unloaded gun in his pocket.

&gt; Despite the door being closed, Newman fired his handgun approximately four times and killed Hill.""

Just blindly shooting through closed doors without being able to see what is on the other side.  Smart.

&gt; Because the jury found that Mascara was only 1% responsible, the verdict was reduced to 4 cents, and then, because the jury found that Hill was drunk at the time, the final payout was nothing.

Ah yes, being drunk in your own home is absolutely awful.  Shooting a gun through a closed door is perfectly fine.

&gt; Mascara applauded the verdict, saying, ""Newman was placed in a very difficult situation and like so many fellow law enforcement officers must do every day, he made the best decision he could for the safety of his partner, himself and the public given the circumstances he faced.""

Yes, officers must make difficult desicions everyday.

&gt; ""After Newman knocked on the doors, the garage door opened revealing Hill within the comfort of his own garage and home,"" the lawsuit alleged. ""Upon information and belief, Deputy Lopez indicated loudly that Hill had a gun and then the garage door closed. Despite the door being closed, Newman fired his handgun approximately four times and killed Hill.""

Lopez announced that Hill had a gun... but

&gt; The bullet from the first shot got stuck in the door, Phillips said. The second and third hit Hill in the abdomen, and the fourth struck Hill's head, he said. Lopez did not open fire.

Not only that they chose to helicopter him to the hospital even though he was the least injured while the Husband of the couple may have survived had to be taken by ground ambulance. 

It is believed that the police may have chose to let him off with a $15 ticket instead of more serious charges, because of his family.

The left wants No Fly, No Buy, while the right says that's a violation of the 5th and 2nd Amendments. Gun control proposals are being thrown back and forth, as are arguments of their effectiveness.

Project Exile was the name of a new gun control law, and public outreach program that was enacted in 1997 in Richmond, Virginia. Richmond, at the time had a huge gang and gun violence problem. Roughly 85% of murders in Richmond were commuted with a firearm.


The premise was that if you were found with an illegal firearm, you were sentenced (exiled) to 5 years in federal prison. This left law abiding gun owners alone, and did not infringe on their rights. While applying a heavy punishment to illegal gun owners, while also adding a federal offense to their record, which means they would fail background checks in the future, if they ever tried to purchase another firearm.


A huge public outreach campaign was launched that put ""An illegal gun will get you 5 years in Federal prison"" across 15 billboards and city bus which had a different route everyday, as to maximize chances of being seen. The city also conducted outreach via radio, promotional TV spots, business cards and traffic reports. Richmond also asked citizens to report illegal guns via an anonymous hotline. 


The results were astounding:

&gt;During the first 10 months of 1998, compared with the same period of the previous year, the total number of homicides committed in Richmond was down 36 percent and the number of firearm homicides was down 41 percent.

.

&gt;As of November 1998, Project Exile had achieved the following results:

&gt; -372 persons indicted for Federal gun violations.

&gt; -440 guns seized.

&gt; -300 persons arrested or held in State custody.

&gt; -222 arrestees (more than 74 percent) held without bond.

&gt; -247 persons convicted.

&gt; -196 persons sentenced to an average of 55 months of imprisonment.

If we're going to get gun control right we can't scream and yell and pass legislation on gut reactions. We need to sit down, and have an adult, fact based, conversation. Legislation and public outreach like Project Exile, which has since been adopted to the whole of Virginia, is a great place to start.

They just went to schools just like we adults did when we were of their age and then all of a sudden Boom ! Boom ! Boom !

I mean this is so surreal which happens almost on a regular basis in our schools now that everybody stopped counting how many shootings we had in our country's schools since the first school shooting decades ago in Paducah, KY.

But the worst part of these school shootings like the one in Parkland,Florida we saw on the tv. yesterday was the official reactions from Trump and the Republicans which always starts with ""We're sorry for the loss of lives"" and ends with some mere condolences to the families of the victims.

That's it.

Nothing else.

Why ?

To know the reasons for these Republican politicians' and their sold out president Trump's lackadaisical reactions are nothing but millions of dollars of contributions that they've already received from the gun manufacturers which were channeled through N.R.A. 

Nothing else. 

In fact, these huge contributions that Trump and the majority of the Republican congress members received in their last election campaigns, is totally mind blowing.

Even Trump's primary nemesis  'small hands' Marco Rubio got over 3 million dollars from N.R.A. for his last Senatorial reelection purposes. 

And that's one of the smallest contributions.

No wonder we'll witness thousands more of these school shootings and other gun deaths at the rate 40,000 + going on in this country at a rapid pace with no end in sight unless and until the children or the grandchildren of Trump and the Republican politicians and the mercenaries running the N.R.A. organization and the gun manufactures are killed in the same fashion that these totally innocent children who died yesterday.

Shame on us too that we cannot stop ""This American carnage"" that criminal Trump touted in his inaugural address.

Irony is our illegitimate president is now the source of this ""National carnage' along with all the Republicans who do not want to stop taking money from the gun manufacturers through N.R.A.

That is the main reason why our children are being slaughtered like chicken in poultry farms in their schools by our own animal like citizens whom Trump refuses to brand as 'terrorists' only because they're Christians. 

On the other hand he calls all the Muslim Americans,""terrorists"" even if one of them kills one American by mistake.

So let us lease all say : "" To hell with Trump. To hell with the Republicans if they don't take this pledge with us,

These Republican members of congress and their most horrible president have to be told very clearly that we'll not accept any more deaths in this country with the guns that they deliberately do not want to control because of billions of dollars worth of kickbacks they've already received from the gun manufacturers through the honchos of N.R.A. 

And just like the 2nd Amendment which we all cherish, these children who perished two days back in Florida and millions of adults who lost their lives due to gun violence, had rights to prosper and live in Liberty as specifically written in our Constitution by our elders that Trump and the Republicans didn't honor.

It's long past time to stop these monsters.

But on the other hand what each and every Americans should know that these animals from G.O.P. who're running their show are also true soulmates of these butchers who kill innocent children and adults alike because of the inner happiness the Republican party members and their wretched president Trump experience after each shootings.

These horrible people think only about the amount of money they'd be making from the stupid Americans like us who'll give our hard earned dollars to the gun stores to buy guns thinking that those guns would protect us.

Wrong !

So we can easily say that the pleasures that Trump and the Republicans get after each gun deaths in the country are the main reasons why there are so many gun deaths in this country in the first place. 

We also have to know that these enablers of the gun deaths in this country do not want to share the same euphoria or pleasures with the rest of the Americans except their own party members.

Yes, all the Americans should know that Trump and the Republicans feel immense pleasures in their heart of hearts each time an American is killed by a gun.

It is ironic but true that though each time these most disgusting butchers who're equipped with AR-15 rifles or semi-Automatic rifles with bump stocks attached to them, kill our babies in their schools and the playgrounds they play at, Trump and the congressional Republicans do shed some crocodile tears to show us that they really care for us and want to stop these useless killings but in reality we the Americans should know that these  horrible politicians from the right feel no sorrows for lives lost like we in the left feel in the core of our hearts for our dead babies.

These people on the right have neither any hearts for the children nor for our adult ones even after the loss of our innocent citizens because of the 'bonus' grafts they receive from the gun stores and gun manufacturers which is forwarded to Trump and the Republicans through N.R.A. after each shooting deaths of our citizens and residents of this otherwise greatest country of the world, called U.S.A.

No wonder we're witnessing one massacre after another in our schools and also in our own backyards because of the unequivocal  supports that Trump and the Republicans are showering on these 'children's killers' in schools and killers of the adult Americans on the streets of our country or in our offices or in our gyms or where ever our citizens go to, like movie theaters, thinking our govt. will keep us safe and not let us be killed.

Wrong !

Yes the irony is, these fantastic Americans who died at the gun violence didn't realize before they were killed by these animals that because of the patronage and huge sums of money from the gun lobby, mainly the N.R.A, our Republican congress members and their titular head of a president called Trump didn't show any desire to stop our citizens' killings at the hands of these butchers who didn't distinguish between the good Americans and the bad ones like Trump and his Republican cohorts. 

That killed only the good ones for nothing thinking they were killing wild horses.

And the Republicans just sat there and watched the show, not even trying to slow down the pace of killings.
They rather gave those bad guys more and more guns without any background checks.  

Well maybe not for too long.

It has become universally known now after the latest school shooting in Florida that Trump and the congressional Republicans allowed these killers possess all the baby killing equipment deliberately for money.

Yes, we have no doubts in our minds that these 'baby killers' easily bought freely available handguns and rifles with modified versions of weapons used by our Army in the wars in the middle-east because Trump and the Republicans have no desire to stop any flow of illegal guns in this country because of more than $10 billion that the gun lobby spent in electing Republican members of congress over the years through N.R.A. as the conduit between the Republicans and the gun manufacturers.

So let us have no questions left in our mind about where we should stand in the gun debate going on in the whole country.

Rather, let us declare openly that Trump and the Republicans are totally responsible for the slaughter of 40+ thousands of American citizens every year along with hundreds of children below the age of 14 and under who are dying from firearms with a whopping rate of 91% among all the dead Americans who die horribly facing the other end of the barrel of a gun, as per ""The American Journal of Medicine"".

So all this hubris created by Trump and his Republican partners in crime, are nothing but a total B.S. first.

Second it's a crime that is being committed by the folks on the right of the spectrum who're deliberately handing over all the lethal weapons at the hands of the home grown ""terrorists"" the ""term"" Trump refuses to bring up while describing these butchers only because these butchers, like this horrible dog who killed 17 Angels in a school in Parkland, Florida, are Whites.

Second, they all support Trump and voted for him in the last election while wearing ""M.A.G.A."" red baseball caps.

On the other hand Trump and the members of the Republican party which literally should be called a 'party of hypocrites' because on one hand they want to confer 'person hood' status to all the unborn children and proclaim on national tv. while winking to their own members standing nearby that they want to save 'not yet born' children's lives from the hands of the abortion doctors.

But as almost all the Americans know now thanks to the social media that Trump and the Republicans laugh on their way to the banks and also while coming out of all the financial institutions in the country as well as outside after each school shootings, because of the huge amounts of 'reward money' that N.R.A. puts in their 'shell' accounts for the so called fantastic jobs they do in favor of the gun manufacturers by not allowing the Democrats to bring up any bill for gun control in the congress.

I've always held the view that gun laws need to be changed. The idea of banning guns appeals to me because of how basic it is. If you ban guns, you get rid of almost all gun violence, period. But, as I stated before, gun laws can also be changed. Given the power of the NRA, we will never ban guns outright, so there are many other solutions. 1. If you still want to own guns, we can adopt a system such as Japan - every person who purchases a gun gets a very thorough background check, gets their mental health checked after purchase, and can only purchase weapons that cannot mow down crowds of people in seconds (Shotguns, pistols, bolt-action anything, etc.) 2. Require guns to be kept at gun ranges, if someones only intent of having a gun is to shoot it at gun ranges or to have fun with it, there is no trouble in keeping guns at gun ranges. This would exclude guns for hunting. 3. Ban all semi-automatic and machine guns. In all seriousness, in the case of home invasion or self-defense, when do you need a semi or full automatic? A pistol, shotgun, or any weapon that cannot be used for mass shootings should do just fine in the case of you defending yourself from 1 or two people. Now, if you are defending yourself from a small army or mob, you have a different problem on your hands. Now on the what you said. From what you said earlier, you seemed to favor the argument of ""Guns don't kill people, people do"" where I totally agree. It is not the gun that kills people, it is the person. A gun simply enables them to do so. If we were to somehow get rid of every single person who should not own a gun then we would be fine, but we can't. With the laws in place today, we cannot weed out every suspicious person who is going to buy a gun - or even more realistically - has a gun. Now with your last statement - I deeply implore you to look at nations such as Austalia, they banned all guns, and look what happened? Violence itself goes down in massive numbers - lives were saved. I would like to leave you with a final thought, you carry a gun for the hypothetical case that your life is threatened.

""Yeah Right, Trump and LaPierre ! You two friends of the 'baby killers', really think that our I.Q.'s are low as yours.""

Trump, who's no stranger to lies as we've seen him lying again and again in his campaign trails and from the Oval Office, is giving us farcical explanations as to what could've prevented this latest school shooting.

His idea of arming the teachers is so absurd from the beginning that even the majority of 700,000+ teachers have rejected his proposal. 

They rightly think that their jobs are to teach the students.
Not packing handguns.

Irony is Trump will never call these animals 'terrorists' because of their White skin color but used the same term at least thousand times against the American Muslim citizens.

Yes, we Americans must always remember that Trump never used  the term 'American Terrorists' to describe the White butchers like Nicolas Cruz only because he was a White Christian boy just like Trump himself or like other White animals like Timothy McVeigh, Dylann Roof and Stephen Paddock and all other 'White Supremacists' or 'White Nationalists' Americans who voted for him in the last election.

So because of Trump and his fellow Republicans' patronage these White animals only kill people who're 'dispensable' like what we saw on t.v. when 58 people died while watching a concert in Las Vegas or 9 Parishioners who died ""Studying Bible While Black"" in a church in South Carolina or the innocent students studying in schools to become doctors and engineers that our country desperately needs.

And the fact that none of Trump's family or the family members of the Republican politicians who sold their souls to N.R.A. and M.I.C. for huge amounts of contributions are not dying, says a lot about when this ""american Carnage' will stop ?

Never.

Or at least not until the children or grandchildren, of Trump and the Republicans and the children of the honchos of N.R.A. or the gun manufacturers who're very heavily protected in their private schools unlike our children who go to totally unprotected public schools, die too in gun violence.

And sadly but truly that is indeed a very sad chapter of our Constitution which was supposed to grant every one of us ""Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness"" while also protecting our rights to carry guns under the 'Second Amendment'. 

Unfortunately, Trump and the Republicans are protecting the latter while trashing our foremost desire : to live a long and happy life in this great country of ours, called U.S.A.",Everyone in this country knows guns are lethal  Even the children in the latest school shooting in Florida saw first hand what came out from the barrel of a gun ,25.0,ihatejoemcCarthy 25,EveryoneinthiscountryknowsgunsarelethalEventhechildreninthelatestschoolshootinginFloridasawfirsthandwhatcameoutfromthebarrelofagun,1724.11,2292.84

This is due to the fact that up until that time, if someone entered a public area and began shooting people, it was usually because they wanted to take hostages and have demands met. So the police were trained to surround the area and control the damage, instead of engaging the shooter(s) and causing more casualties. Now it’s 2018, and the response tactics have changed, but there are still many cops who were hired decades ago and were trained by the old rules. As they say, when shit hits the fan you don’t rise to the occasion, you fall to your lowest level of training. Scot Peterson, the deputy whom everyone is using as a scapegoat to place their anger on to, was a 33 year veteran of the Sheriff’s Dept. It is highly possible that in the heat of the moment, he simply reverted back to this basic level of training where he was taking what he knew to be the best course of action. Communication breakdowns happen during these types of incidents all the time as well. Perhaps for some reason he and the other arriving deputies thought the shooter WAS taking hostages.

So with the whole shooting in Vegas today got me thinking about gun rights in America. I come from a family who doesn't hunt so I don't have much background in it but this is my opinion. I think that all automatic assault rifles should be flat out banned from the U.S with two exceptions, one being the military and the other being at gun ranges. I say they should still be at gun ranges because gun nuts often say ""I like my ar's cause they're fun to shoot."" This satisfies both sides with gun nuts being able to shoot and democrats getting ar's out of the U.S. Then some people may say they need it for self defense, but who in the right mind would use a ar for self defense and the odds of you ever needing a gun for self defense in your lifetime is slim to none. So with ar's out of the way let's get to hunting rifles. I think these should be allowed in the U.S because hunting is a big part of the culture here and we can't take that away. But, my idea with these rifles is to build shops that are built to hold these rifles in the off-season of hunting. So these buildings would hold people's guns for a small fee and doing this would first get guns out of people's hands, second create jobs in the U.S, and third create another source of revenue for the U.S because it will boost the economy. Then, for the gun nuts again who say they want their guns to shoot for fun, there will be shooting ranges at the gun holding facility so gun owners can pick their gun up on site (free of charge), go shoot for a bit, then return their gun back as simple as tat. Then with no guns being in people's hands you won't need them for self defense and such. This solution satisfies both sides of the spectrum because democrats get guns out of the us and republicans still get to shoot their guns.

They take bribes to stop Americans from protecting our communities and families.

They take bribes again, and again, and again while the bodies pile up, and still they take the money and vote their blood-soaked wallets to stop basic reform.

They allow gun manufacturers to dictate American law, and laugh on top of an ever-growing mountain of coffins of all sizes.

The moment a foreign Muslim so much as acts crazy, these vicious monsters are introducing legislation to shut down the country.  But no amount of death and destruction inflicted on America by *their constituents* is sufficient for them to support doing anything to reduce the thousands of murders they personally have enabled.

This is what evil looks like.  In the crazed shooter, certainly.  But it's larger than that - in the people who feast on the blood he spilled, because gun manufacturers profit massively every single time this sort of thing happens.  

This is not hyperbole: **They want mass-shootings**.  They do everything in their power to cause them.  They create the environment, the means, the motives with unhinged bigotry and conspiracy theory propaganda, and the opportunity by dismantling all law and order.

The NRA is nothing more than the bribe-dispensary arm of the gun manufacturing industry, and the Republican Party is nothing more than a gang of lying, thieving, murdering butchers.

There is no denying it.  This is who they are, and they have spent years building this kind of horror.  It will continue and get worse the longer they are in control.  It will spread like cancer from every single institution they touch, because their greed and hate are without bound.

These Republicans will do nothing or say nothing to the N.R.A. even if there is another attack like the last one where Stephen Paddock butchered men,women and children like cattle with 27 guns which a I.S.I.S. fighter in U.S.A. will never get hold of unless he's a White Christian citizen.

But beside calling me a past member of the most notorious national organization called N.R.A., I've to admit that I was  totally petrified by the tactics and attitudes of the leaders of this devilish organization who do not care for the lives of the innocent Americans like us who're dying everyday because of their desire to amass millions of dollars of hush money that they make from Gun manufactures. 

And we all know that part of the billions of dollars that they take in as a cut from the total sales of all the guns sold in this country and abroad, they distribute a huge portion of that illegal blood money among mainly the Republican lawmakers as well as to some Democratic members.

Yes,this organization is swimming in the blood and destruction of the innocent Americans and their families like these 58+ great Americans which another low life American called Stephen Paddock butchered from the 32nd floor of his hotel windows as if he was killing the I.S.I.S. members.

But either he didn't know or didn't care that these Country Music Concert goers were all American citizens, born and brought up in this great country until the N.R.A. started using their influence among Republican lawmakers and their presidents Bush and Trump by donating millions of dollars of hush money so that no legislation is passed that can take away the assault rifles from its members which this butcher took full advantage of by amassing 43+ long guns as well as stockpiling with chemicals that could easily blow up the hotel he was staying in just like Tim McVeigh did to Oklahoma federal building in the '90's.

N.R.A. made sure with our lawmakers that pass no legislation against 'bump stock' either that can kill thousands of Americans in 9 minutes as this butcher in Las Vegas used to kill and maim many of the Republicans voters and supporters too beside some very ordinary American citizens who just wanted to have a good time in an open air concert.

But this horrible monster didn't want to give them or families any comforts because of his inner turmoil or who knows what, and rained down thousands of bullets on these innocent American people by using two windows of the Hotel he was staying in, killing dozens beside injuring 500+ of our fantastic citizens.

But what our most horrible president Trump is saying ?

Nothing. Except saying ""we'll have a discussion on gun control later on."" 

Because that's what the N.R.A. officials told him and the Republican lawmakers so that everybody forgets about these latest killings in Las Vegas.

This way there will be no need for toughening up any measures of gun control bills still pending in the Congress.

Yes, N.R.A.,Trump and all the Republicans will use the same tactics even if there is a copy cat attack of the recent killings by a mass murderer which according to the F.B.I. is a real possibility as our beautiful country is also full of crazed gunmen like Paddock who'll kill innocent Americans just for fame or just for the fun of it .

And to everyone's horror, Trump and the Republicans will totally ignore it like they're doing now only because N.R.A. said so.

On the second point, it seems clear that for the immediate future, our society as a whole lacks the ability to take steps that will reduce the likelihood and/or toll of mass shootings (and of gun violence generally). That's why we need to immediately support mandatory firearm liability insurance that will help victims of gun violence and their families better cope with the financial toll taken by firearms. And for any ""gaps"" that firearm liability insurance would not cover, we should support a fee on firearm sales that would go toward a ""Gun Violence Victim Fund"" to defray the financial cost of gun violence. Democrats should work on all fronts to confront gun violence, but mandatory firearm liability insurance is something that can be done now to assist those impacted by gun violence.

So if Trump is not a racist monster, instead of asking his V.P. and his totally racist followers walk out of the games, he should instruct all the White police officers not to shoot any Black men if they're unarmed as enough Black men have died already at the hands of Trump's White followers and his White Police officers.

The war in Vietnam where Trump is travelling now while avoiding it in the 60's draft with a 'phantom' bone spur on his foot, on his 12 day Asia trip, was not a war that we won.

George W. Bush and his father Bush Sr., won three wars among themselves with two wars against Saddam's Iraqi regime who had nothing to fight against us with.

If George W. didn't lie about Saddam having 'weapons of mass destruction', we wouldn't have lost more than 3,000 bravest men and women of this world into a sham war for nothing.

I once understood their position where you could have a gun for protection, just not their need for an assault rifle. How sick of a human being must you be to try and erase a perpetrator’s chance of survival, when they’re likely trying to make ends meet for their family? Isn’t it no different than you going to your boring office job to keep food on the table? 

That in mind, I no longer advocate the concept of guns in the household anymore. Worried about a potential break in? Use either mace, a stun gun, or wasp spray to keep the assailant subdued in a human manner. Call the police, and let the poor soul live. IMHO, there’s no such thing as “justified homicide”, which is the legal system’s pathetic way of rationalizing a human death. 

Want to hunt, or target shoot? Keep your rifle at a sporting club, or rent a police locker. Although I’ll still think you’re a pathetic excuse for a human for killing animals, I’d much rather your gun is stored in such a way that keeps you from going on a killing spree one day out of the blue when you reach your breaking point. 

Although this is just my opinion, I’m well aware that these types of laws are unrealistic, here’s my proposal which would be a huge win, when the next mass shooting happens we could tighten the laws even further. 

My compromise proposal, for now... 
For now, you are allowed to store your guns in the home. 21 years old to buy, You must pass extensive psych evaluations. These Evals would include, but not be limited to, financial competence, eye examinations, regular drug and alcohol testing. If you own a gun, you forgo your “right” to drink alcohol, that’s common sense, people get in drunken fist fights all the time. Guns just add more fuel to that. 

You must be willing to put your house in a registry, that goes to local and federal police departments, so they can make routine home inspection of your storage for your guns, if the safe you keep your gun in can easily be cracked, your guns are confiscated until you can provide sufficient storage. If your gun is categorized as an assault weapon, you’re a felon. No exceptions. 

Edit: forgot to mention, NO weapon stockpiling under any circumstances. You’re limited to a rifle, a shotgun, and a handgun. No semi-automatics, and if you want a new gun, you have to sell the existing class of gun first. Meaning, if you want a new handgun, you have to sell your handgun beforehand, and a portion of the money on the sale has to go to a valid gun control organization, such as Mom’s Demand Action.

FACTS:


To buy a gun, Connecticut law requires residents apply for a local permit, typically with the town's police chief, have their fingerprints taken and submit to a state and federal background check with a 14-day waiting period. To buy a handgun, residents also are required to take a gun safety course.  You also must be at least 21 years old to possess a handgun outside of your own home in Connecticut.  Additionally all schools in Connecticut are gun free zones so you cannot have a gun on school property regardless of if you have a valid gun carry permit or not. 


On top of all that listed above, Federal law requires that all firearms acquired via a purchase from a commercial establishment (gun store, pawn shop etc) complete Federal form #4473 and the purchaser must pass a mandatory background check to ensure that they are not in the national system as a felon, have a restraining order against them, are a fugitive from justice, a habitual drug user, or as have been reported as someone who has been judged as having a mental defect.



While the event that occurred yesterday was extremely tragic, Tougher  laws or an outright ban will not prevent anything! The shooter was only 20 years old and the shooting occurred on school property by someone that reportedly had a history of mental instability.   Multiple laws had already been broken before this killer even killed his first victim.

TL;DR  Gun Laws are not the answer, a mental health system is the solution for deranged individuals such as this!

&gt; On April 21, 1945, Inouye was grievously wounded while leading an assault on a heavily-defended ridge near San Terenzo in Tuscany, Italy called Colle Musatello. The ridge served as a strongpoint along the strip of German fortifications known as the Gothic Line, which represented the last and most dogged line of German defensive works in Italy. As he led his platoon in a flanking maneuver, three German machine guns opened fire from covered positions just 40 yards away, pinning his men to the ground. Inouye stood up to attack and was shot in the stomach; ignoring his wound, he proceeded to attack and destroy the first machine gun nest with hand grenades and fire from his Thompson submachine gun. After being informed of the severity of his wound by his platoon sergeant, he refused treatment and rallied his men for an attack on the second machine gun position, which he also successfully destroyed before collapsing from blood loss.

&gt;As his squad distracted the third machine gunner, Inouye crawled toward the final bunker, eventually drawing within 10 yards. As he raised himself up and cocked his arm to throw his last grenade into the fighting position, a German inside fired a rifle grenade that struck him on the right elbow, severing most of his arm and leaving his own primed grenade reflexively ""clenched in a fist that suddenly didn't belong to me anymore"".[10] Inouye's horrified soldiers moved to his aid, but he shouted for them to keep back out of fear his severed fist would involuntarily relax and drop the grenade. As the German inside the bunker reloaded his rifle, Inouye pried the live grenade from his useless right hand and transferred it to his left. As the German aimed his rifle to finish him off, Inouye tossed the grenade off-hand into the bunker and destroyed it. He stumbled to his feet and continued forward, silencing the last German resistance with a one-handed burst from his Thompson before being wounded in the leg and tumbling unconscious to the bottom of the ridge. When he awoke to see the concerned men of his platoon hovering over him, his only comment before being carried away was to gruffly order them to return to their positions, since, as he pointed out, ""nobody called off the war!""[11]

I made the statement that they shouldn't be included because people will commit suicide regardless of the way it is done.

The above responds to your second point. Second, I would love to limit vehicular stats to those that remove suicides and only include violence. Unfortunately, there are no stats for that. Go ahead, play with the link I provided to the WISQARS database. I am not trying to cherrypick, I am just saying that it is a fair comparison to link violence related, non-suicide gun fatalaties to car fatalities. Why? Because of unintentional and undetermined firearm deaths are less than 12k from '99 to 2010. That is such a small number that even if you add that to violent non-suicide, it doesn't change the overall outlook.

I didn't have to mention that point, the OP did. I am not saying that those didn't change it, but the original article used a specific timespan, and I, in fairness, used the same timespan. 

Unfortunately, in that same timespan '99-'10, the number of privately held firearms has [increased](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/dec/17/how-many-guns-us) every year according to the FBI.


Also, again, they have some of the strictest safety regulations. [Here](http://www.atf.gov/publications/download/p/atf-p-5300-4.pdf) is the 2005 ATF *reference* guide. It is over 200 pages. I'm sorry, it is already plenty safe, difficult, and full of red tape.

I mean, look, I am not trying to tell you guys that you're wrong, that we should have no legislation on guns. What I am trying to show is that we do have it. The stats show that they remain safe, although they are weapons of destruction. Stats show we are having less and less mass shootings every year. I know it doesn't seem that way, but it is true.

We probably don't need new regulations, but if you insist on it, at least go into it with all the knowledge.",I did respond to the actual point  showing via the same stats slate used that if you don t include suicides  then the article is wrong  I made the statement that,16.0,thegreenlabrador 16,IdidrespondtotheactualpointshowingviathesamestatsslateusedthatifyoudontincludesuicidesthenthearticleiswrongImadethestatementthat,2460.775,3338.249

To be totally honest I just don't know anymore.  I grew up around guns, I like guns, I enjoy target shooting, I enjoy the variety and history of guns. I have this neat little rifle called an M38, a Russian Mosin rifle made for tank crews I believe. It even has the hammer and sickle stamped on it, made in 1943. It is a cool piece of history and fun to shoot, but I am not defending my home or fighting an oppressive regime with it. 

I believe we do have a gun tradition/culture in the US and sometimes these things are not based on facts or reason. With so many of us being gun owners and active participants in those traditions, it makes it very difficult to question its validity even in the face of tragedy. I think the prevailing attitude is ""Well I am not Adam Lanza so no need to take away my guns of any type"". That, to me, is a very selfish way to think. 

I think its time we start to question the need for certain types of guns, namely ones capable of high volume shooting. ARs, AKs, SKSs, Mini-14/30s, are not the gun of choice for hunters and even the rounds, though capable, are not the best choice(or legal) for hunting. So why do we need them? Why do we need handguns capable holding 15+ rounds? Why do so many of us feel the need to armed for a fire fight that will never happen? Is it that the traditions of hunting are not popular anymore to the gun industry has to sell the evil boogy man to get you to buy that ""tactical"" shotgun and AR?

You will hear stories of how an armed citizen stopped a crime and I do not doubt that does happen sometimes but that is not data. The data we do have is that 30,000+ people died last year due to firearms. Are we really expected to believe that number would go up with less guns? 

Maybe I am a hypocrite but I still hold on to the idea that I have a right to protect myself, my home, and my family, but I dont think I need an AR that's on the boarder line of being a real assault rifle or even going Boondock Saints in my living room.",I also made the switch so its no surprise that I own a couple of guns  To be totally honest I just don t know anymore  I grew up around guns ,16.0,josebolt 16,IalsomadetheswitchsoitsnosurprisethatIownacoupleofgunsTobetotallyhonestIjustdontknowanymoreIgrewuparoundguns,2022.564,3299.898

"" When distinguished as a subset of handguns, a pistol is a handgun with a chamber that is integral with the barrel, such as a pepperbox revolver—as opposed to a standard (single-barrel) revolver, wherein the chamber is separate from the barrel as a revolving cylinder.[1]""


http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-revolver-and-vs-pistol/


""Revolver was developed by Samuel Colt in 1836. It got its name because of a revolving cylinder that contains cartridges and fires through a single barrel. On the other hand, pistol was developed around 1885 and worked on the principle of a mousetrap that was invented by Stevens Maxim. The best known pistol of all times, the Colt 1911 used this mousetrap technology and is still being used by police personnel in many parts of the world.

As described earlier, rounds in a revolver are held in a revolving cylinder that rotates to fire the shot through a single barrel. As the user pulls the trigger, the hammer goes ahead and strikes the chamber containing cartridge. Hammer cocking takes place with the shooter pulling it back after every shot.""

This concept is old hat, but in the decade since CNN, Fox News, et. al. reinvented TV journalism, where is the outcry? The gun control debate aside, we're allowing media companies to knowingly propagandize for the benefit of themselves and they're business partners and allies, 24-hours-a-day, on a multitude of channels and platforms, and we don't discuss this obvious danger at all.

We complain about the other side's lies, but are apparently content to allow this system to be in place, despite the fact that huge swaths of our population have become so heavily propagandized they believe in an almost completely fictionalized version of reality. This is beyond a political issue. This is how we perceive life itself, and we're allowing corporations to control that perception on a level that will lead to mass shootings and worse. This is where climate change denial comes from. This is where, even on the left,  support for unilateral war without declaration of war comes from. This is where acquiescence to the elimination of civil liberties comes from. 

I have no interest in discussing gun control laws vis a vis mass shootings while cable news channels and their parent companies are allowed free reign to lie all day every day while claiming even a loose affiliation with journalism.

""hur dur, suggesting that prayer isn't a solution to gun control is as bad as democrats demanding gun control and more access to mental health services but never really doing anything about it after a few days of yelling.""

There has been legislation in Congress about mental health care proposed by (you guessed it) democrats that has been held up by republicans. The same group that whines about helping veterans but continuously shoots down any legislation or money in an effort to help those veterans. 

Ironic, isn't it? First to randomly send people to war, last to want to help them after they come home in pieces. Last to act whenever the suicide rate spikes to historic highs and first to suggest that mental health isn't the solution to that epidemic. 

Nobody is attacking your shitty personal beliefs. Nobody is attacking your right to pray. Quit trying to be a fucking martyr like the rest of the GOP. 

The problem here is clearly intelligence. Not only did you not read the article, you absolutely cannot discern between someone saying, 'We need more action than simple prayer"" (which is all republicans leaders could be bothered to produce in the aftermath of all recent shootings) and ""QUIT PRAYING!"" which is what you and your ilk are somehow interpreting it to mean.

I'll say this also, since you don't seem to understand how basic government works: The republicans control the House and the Senate. All Obama can do is veto any legislation that passes both ends of Congress but the only legislation the GOP has been able to pass (even with their double majority) is 'LET'S KILL OBAMACARE!'

What a bunch of NRA puppets and dolts. Two mass shootings in a week and the GOP gets together to repeal Obamacare for the 45th time because, you know, Obamacare is actually *saving* lives while guns are taking them on a daily basis in the U.S. 

So fuck your prayer (personal opinion, not the opinion of the article you couldn't be bothered to read) and your lack of information and intelligence. You're the typical American…you clearly never invested in any type of higher education but you want to demand that your shitty opinions are as valuable as other peoples' facts. 

Prayer hasn't done (and will *not* do) fuck all. If you disagree, you're not wrong  because we are not on the same page, you're wrong because there have been centuries of prayer from people who want violence and war to end and yet we continue to have it. 

And if the right had *so much* faith in prayer, it's laughable that you assholes want to carry guns around with you everywhere you go.

Awww…what's the matter? Afraid *your* prayer might not be effective enough to save you from being the victim in a nation where guns are easier to get than driver's licenses? 

If you have so much faith in prayer and if the GOP is dumb enough to cling to prayer as a serious answer to the current mess of mass shootings, then put your fucking guns away and start praying.

Because suggesting that action along with prayer is dumb (which is what the article suggests) is as dumb as suggesting that you need a gun *along* with prayer, just to be sure.

The reason those features were put in place is irrelevant to whether someone buys a car to, say drive around their farm or race around on their own private track, whatever. You say it's a red herring, I say it's a point that's irrelevant to the discussion. 

You say cars don't need to be licensed on private property because they can't be ballistically launched, but you ignore the fact that despite all of those safety features you've listed that were made for public roads (maybe not so irrelevant) despite all of those cars still kill more people than guns. That's not even including the statistics involved with firearm related deaths, last figure I saw was 60% were suicide. Unfortunate, but those deaths would have happened, if someone wants to take their own life, theyre going to find a means to it. Japan has shown that strict gun control does not prevent suicide. So that's over half of gun related deaths right there

Of the remaining gun related deaths you have accidents and homicides. As far as homicides go, a staggering 80% is gang related. Gang violence is an issue, and certainly needs to be addressed, but cannot be used in support of gun regulation, due to the simple fact that these typically are not legally obtained firearms. I know this is rhetoric but it's got a point to it, putting stricter gun laws in place won't do much to deter criminals, since the law is something they don't listen to anyways. Orlando is an exception to this rule however, due to the fact these firearms were purchased legally. Seems logical that strict gun laws would have prevented him from obtaining the firearms to commit this massacre. No guns no crime right? Well then consider the motive, when someone is committed to a cause such as that, they're not going to be deterred. Whether they obtain illegal firearms which are easily accessible, or by manufacturing a car bomb which is not to far fetched a thought, they act will still be done. If it had been a car bomb and he drove it through the front door, I doubt anyone would have walked out. But admittedly the car bomb spiel of mine is speculation. I'm not saying he should have had easy access considering he was previously under watch, and a flag should have been raised, but flat out regulation would not have prevented something like this. The tool of the crime is easily changed, the person and the motive is the same.

Of the remaining gun related deaths, 20% of homicides are not gang related, but due to various other reasons. The final part are accidents. I believe accidents account for approximately 30% of gun related deaths, and some steps can certainly be made to prevent those, a loaded indicator, child locks and simple basic safety training that should be done by the state, not the federal government.(that's my opinion) so of those deaths, accidental and the 20% of homicides, that encompasses far fewer deaths than cars.

You claim that it's conspiracy nuts who are the only ones worried about government abuse of power. Normally I might agree with you. But consider some relatively recent events. The government flat out permitted the legal sale of firearms to illegal buyers to send across the border. Yes this was an attempt at a sting operation that failed miraculously. Some of these guns have been relocated at crime scenes along the border states, and one caused the death of a border patrol agent. Try to understand that, people are made uncomfortable by the fact their government knowingly provided weapons to cartels, but then if the same government restricts the ability of its own citizens, it naturally raised a few eyebrows.

These are legitimate concerns that should be discussed and taken into account by law makers. You claim they're not good reasons for an argument to be made, but it seems more that you just don't want to have it.  Blissful ignorance to views that aren't your own.

It's fine that you don't agree with those reasons. But try to at least entertain them, because that tends to be how understanding works. I do my best to think through why people are for gun control and the reasons behind them, I understand them but the decision I've arrived it is that it simply wouldn't work.

But since you have previously failed to try that understanding, and simply say ""it's just not a very good argument"" without providing reasons for it. 

Since I've explained my view on the matter, and why I think that, yet you don't and simply throw out claims that you fail to back up ""it's just not a very good one"" or using circumstantial examples at best with your toddler example, I can only hope you can one day exercise different thoughts that don't meet your narrative.

1290,376,d4ngtvm,sethop,democrats,Orlando nightclub shooting,1466860653,"To quote from the article: 

&gt;Of course accusations of sexism always bump up against several serious impediments:
&gt;1) Almost nobody will admit to it. Conservatives decided long ago that all such accusations (sexism, racism, homophobia, etc) are standard liberal bullshit whose only real intent is to shut down debate, and liberals tend to possess a sense of moral entitlement which leads them to consider themselves automatically exempt from all such accusations. (Side note: if you did roll your eyes above, there’s a good chance I’m describing you here. Sorry.)

Can anyone try to explain this “moral entitlement” remark? What does it mean? I don’t feel ‘entitled’ to anything. I feel a sense of despair about America shooting itself in both feet, and a degree of fear for our collective future. But “entitled”? No. 

I’d love to have Elizabeth Warren as President. I would also prefer Elizabeth over any other VP pick. I'd be fine with Hillary as nominee if she was polling 20 points better vs Trump, and there was no sign that the FBI might indict her. I think that applies to a lot of Bernie supporters, although I worry that it might be a minority viewpoint among us, enlightened pragmatism hardly seems all that common anywhere these days, and I'd be inclined to think that Hillary's supporters have far more of it than Bernie's do. Also, my gut feeling is that Bernie’s policies would be far better for Women (and Minorities) than Hillary’s would be, and his track record of advocacy and voting in favor of women (and minorities) is absolutely stellar. So it’s just pretty darn hard for me to locate this so called ‘sexism’ in my personal rationale for supporting Bernie. Others, of course, may differ. 

I suspect that Hillary has always felt that she is forced to appear more ‘masculine’ in order to overcome the sexism from the right, and that sucks, but what terrifies me is whether her ‘muscular’ foreign policy might end up doing America so much more harm than good if she does get elected, but more importantly, that America might *indeed* be too sexist and otherwise biased against her to pick her over Trump, who would probably find some way to destroy the entire planet before he leaves office. 

I fully understand that many others have exactly the same fear about *Bernie* not being electable, and IIRC this is the main reason according to the exit polls that people picked Hillary. I also think it's reasonably clear that if they had know then what most of us know now then they might have chosen differently. Or they might not. 

I think it would have been far, far healthier to have *that* argument become the linchpin of Democratic debate during the primary; ie, who really *was* more electable? Instead we saw an unbelievable amount of totally toxic morale-sucking vote-killing mud-slinging going on from both sides, and I can't help but wonder if we ended up playing straight into their hands.

I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, but short of draconian gun bans, how do we prevent this sort of thing?

The person used a semi-automatic rifle (note: that's not a fully automatic rifle, as they require a crap ton of special licenses to legally own). From that high up, he could have used a regular bolt action deer gun and have killed just as many (or perhaps more, since a deer gun cartridge is more powerful than an AR. So banning so called assault weapons wouldn't have done anything. The shooter could have used a bolt action .308 and killed just as many people.

The person had no history of mental illness. That's not to say that I don't support the idea of universal background checks and keeping all mentally unstable people (once we agree upon a legal working definition) from owning guns. I'm just noting that in this particular instance, it wouldn't have stopped the shooter (I refuse to use his name because he probably wanted to be famous).

This could have just as well happened in Australia, and if I recall, something similar happened in Europe a few years back (a guy used a bolt gun to kill a bunch of people at a fair distance).

Now, with Newtown, we should have passed a universal background check (which the NRA hates for some reason), and should have mandated locking up firearms so that only the owner can access them (unless it's on their person). With Virginia Tech, the shooter was mentally unstable, and it could have been hindered (or prevented) with proper measures. With Columbine, straw man purchasing (which is highly illegal) was used to get the guns. But in this instance, well, it's a much tougher thing to combat because having a weapon with tons of firepower isn't all that crucial with the right vantage point (also noting the shooter had 19 different guns in the hotel room).

If you want to go for draconian gun bans, so be it, but perfectly clear about it, and also realize that you'll lose a lot of elections (meaning losing a chance to influence health policy so that maybe a quarter of those injured in this tragedy don't have to file for medical bankruptcy).

My problem with her is that her good words often ring hollow once you consider the entities and organizations whose interests she represented as both an attorney and a member of the House of Representatives. 

There are a few ways to interpret Gillibrand. One reasonable viewpoint is that she's a career opportunist who is very good at seeing which way the wind is blowing and going along with it for personal enrichment. It's hard for me to take her seriously when she critiques other people for not being principled and strong enough to do the right thing, even if it might harm their career. 

Then again, maybe she really did have some profound awakening -- coinciding perfectly with her becoming a senator -- and these changes of heart are genuine. I have some trouble buying that, but it's possible.

Some light reading on our would-be 2020 candidate:

[As New Lawyer, Senator Was Active in Tobacco’s Defense](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/nyregion/27gillibrand.html)

[Gillibrand's position on gun rights has changed from being against strict gun control in the House to being more ""flexible"" on the issue since she joined the Senate. While in the House, she had received a 100% positive rating from the National Rifle Association, and sponsored an amendment to the 2008 Farm Bill that would have allowed expanded hunting on public lands. On the other hand, Gillibrand worked to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Improvement Act.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Kirsten_Gillibrand#Gun_laws)

My overall point is: I'm glad she's on our team. But she has benefited greatly from having done some really despicable things. Is she really a progressive now?

&gt; If you want to be a lawyer, you gotta defend shitty people along with the good people.

Well, sometimes, and sometimes lawyers shouldn't be criticized for who they represent. If you're  operating within the criminal sphere, where the stakes are much higher, then I think you should be free from criticism based on whom you represent. 

But, **and I say this as a lawyer**, it's perfectly fine to sometimes criticize civil attorneys for who they choose to represent, and for how they choose to represent them. Especially if those attorneys made the conscious choice to go get rich while representing The Worst Company Ever. For one thing, you're setting up a false choice with this:

&gt; Would you rather her have quit her first job as a young lawyer once assigned to a distasteful client and be left with no career experience? 

When the [NYT first reported on this](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/nyregion/27gillibrand.html), they included this important aspect of the situation:

&gt; Still, in an approach that was not uncommon at law firms that represented tobacco companies, lawyers at Davis Polk were permitted to decline work on the tobacco cases if they had a moral or ethical objection to the work, Mr. Chang said.

Let's review the facts, here. Philip Morris set up a lab in Cologne, Germany, to research the effects of cigarettes. They found a clear link between cigarettes and cancer. Tobacco executives testified before Congress that they did not believe cigarettes cause cancer. Cue legal battle. Philip Morris sought to keep their research from the public and the U.S. government (that's at least part of the reason the lab was in Germany). Gillibrand -- by all accounts, enthusiastically -- helped them do this, although she could have removed herself from the case. I can't imagine why it would be off-limits to criticize her for this behavior, **especially** since she has presidential ambitions. 

&gt; She choose to provide pro-bono legal services to abused women and families contending with lead paint in their homes

Firms like Davis Polk let their lawyers work on pro bono cases, but they can only really constitute a small percentage of your overall work time. It's great she did that work, but there are hundreds or thousands of people in New York alone who do similar work, full time, and so I don't see why Gillibrand should get any particular accolades for this.

&gt; But of course you are inclined to believe the worst in her because that seems to be a theme from you -- believing the worst in Democrats and assuming corruption in their motives.

Since the 20's there has been wave after wave  of gun control legislation, all ""common sense"".  Gangsters using sawed off shotguns?  Make them super hard to get legally, require a process that can take 2 years thanks to government inefficiency.  Too bad the criminals didn't care and just took saws to their shotguns anyways.  Criminals buying guns in 1 state and using them in another?  Lets make it impossible to buy a gun in a state you aren't a resident in, regardless of whether the gun would be perfectly legal to buy in your home state.  Too bad criminals ignored the law and continued to smuggle guns around the US.  Too many Hollywood movies featuring machine guns scared little old ladies?  Lets make them illegal to build and drive the price up by 1000% so no normal people can buy them.  Too bad criminals coninued to illegally modify their guns.  Semi auto rifles were used in a major crime?  Assault Weapons act, lets outlaw thousands of weapons based on insane criteria, like if it has a bayonet mount or not.  Too bad that was stupid, and both the passing and ending of said act had zero impact on gun violence in the US.    

Now we want to force people to travel to gun shops and pay for backgrpund checks every time they want to buy or sell a gun?  What about if the closest shop is a 4 hour drive?  I have to pay to have a background check done to sell my beat up 22 to my dad, who already owns 10 guns?  Criminals already circumvent the background check systems we have in place, by stealing guns, or just buying and selling under the table.  California has had those laws in place for decades, and it has done nothing, gun violence is rising here while it is falling in states with less intrusive laws.    

There is simply zero data supporting that universl background checks will do anything, and in fact the data implies that it will do nothing.  None of the major legislation we hae put in place in the last 100 years has done ANYTHING to curb gun violence, so instead of getting the government even more involved in our daily lives, punishing the 150 million law abiding gun owners even more, why don't we spend that time and money actually trying to solve the mental health and econimic disparity problems in out country?",Here s my problem with universal background checks  and I know my opinion is the same as a ton if gun owners  Since the 20 s there has been wave after wave,8.0,CommodorePugsley 8,HeresmyproblemwithuniversalbackgroundchecksandIknowmyopinionisthesameasatonifgunownersSincethe20stherehasbeenwaveafterwave,2028.313,2598.246

I agree with some of your 'very simple' points.

I agree with holding gun owners responsible for their irresponsibility.

I agree with holding ANY gun seller, private or dealer, responsible for where those guns go.  Although, a majority of guns on the streets don't come from gun dealers.

I doubt that there will ever be a 'tazer-like', 'Judge Dredd' gun stamping thing.  I like the idea...actually, that could be fixed by regulating and registering ammunition purchases, although, much with the guns on the street, there's a bunch of ammo out there that wouldn't be subject to any of those simple ideas.

Tax? Yeah.  OK.  Though, it hasn't worked for alcohol or tobacco.

Maybe one thing that might help is instead of crazy criminal penalties for having some MJ on you when you get pulled over for a broken tail light, there are mandatory LONG minimums for gun crimes.

Again, unless every single gun is stolen by the government and we start over, there are no 'very simple' answers.

Kristen Gillibrand swears left and right. The head of the DNC has the mouth of a trucker. The political correctness that is bothersome to democrats is when it's deliberate, demeaning and disrespectful to a certain group of people. 

It's all about the time and place for that stuff, I'm sure most of us are far from political correct majority of the time. If you're considerate and respectful the Political correctness thing shouldn't influence what party you align with more closely. Both sides are hypocritical when it comes to this issue. 

Also you don't have to pick one or the other. You're human, capable of forming you're own opinion, exclusively subscribing to one or the other means you let other people tell you what to believe is right. You can be conservative on some issues, liberal on others. 

You're stance on things can change. That's not a bad thing, that's actually a great thing. In life you learn new information, experience things and they'll change how you view things. 

But the underlying theme of what democrats want is that there is a baseline of things that all Americans are entitled to like retirement checks, education, healthcare, food, voting, among a few others. Value science and adapting to the future of the world opposed to trying to fight it. 

At the current rate of government, if you care about the long term effects and consequences over the short term gains then you're probably more democrat there's a lot of us moderate democrats though. 

Blue Dog democrats is the caucus of moderate Dems in congress if you're interested in seeing if you align with them. 

Carefully look into all the issues and decide for yourself and don't let others tell you what to think. It's also not a binary choice, if someone asks and you want to answer saying your a centrist, moderate, or independent.

Read the document you yourself linked, it is my sole source for what follows...

Better than that, ill annotate it. 

**The intent of the law is that it.**

&gt;1. Urges all States to protect the rights of persons facing the death penalty and other
affected persons by complying with their international obligations, including the rights to
equality and non-discrimination;

This is all good, and designed to be vague. but completely in line with our concept of justice. 


&gt;**2. Calls upon States that have not yet acceded to or ratified the Second Optional Protocol
to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death
penalty to consider doing so;**

The second optional protocol referer to in this statute, . **Each State Party shall take all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty within its jurisdiction.**

This is where any nation that agree that some crimes, even genocide, warrant the death penalty started voting no...

It is an de facto ban on death penalty for ANY crime. 

&gt;3. **Calls upon States that have not yet abolished the death penalty to ensure that it is not
applied on the basis of discriminatory laws or as a result of discriminatory or arbitrary
application of the law;**

There is usually no way to determine if, when i was sentenced to death, it was because i was gay. And The United nations have no organisation to make sure i was not. 

&gt;4. Calls upon States to ensure that all accused persons, in particular poor and
economically vulnerable persons, can exercise their rights related to equal access to justice,
to ensure adequate, qualified and effective legal representation at every stage of civil and
criminal proceedings in capital punishment cases through effective legal aid, and to ensure
that those facing the death penalty can exercise their right to seek pardon or commutation of
their death sentence;

This one is all fine. great even. this is the statute i would like to see passed, without the baggage. 

&gt;5. **Urges States that have not yet abolished the death penalty to ensure that the death
penalty is not applied against persons with mental or intellectual disabilities and persons
below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the crime, as well as pregnant women;**

This is one of those too wague to enforce. because a mental illness in New York Might not be one in the US. but in general, i agree with it as an anti abuse law. 

&gt;6. **Also urges States that have not yet abolished the death penalty to ensure that it is not
imposed as a sanction for specific forms of conduct such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery
and consensual same-sex relations;** 

This is the part Islamic nations rejected or refused to address..",I am being real patient here  Im not scared of answering anything  you answered your own question perfectly i believe   But fine  ill do your homework for you  Read the document,19.0,Batbuckleyourpants 19,IambeingrealpatienthereImnotscaredofansweringanythingyouansweredyourownquestionperfectlyibelieveButfineilldoyourhomeworkforyouReadthedocument,2701.877,4966.698

California versions of semiautomatic center-fire rifles with bullet buttons are now classified as an ""assault weapon"" and must be registered as such (with the bullet button still on it) or made featureless. Please understand why we had the bullet button instead of a standard magazine release to begin with.

Characteristics of an assault weapon now include a pistol grip, forward pistol grip, flash hider, and adjustable stock - featureless involves removing or negating all of these features. (Pistol grip replaced with a fin grip, etc.)

Only rifles purchased pre 2016 with the bullet button can be registered, and must be done so before 7/1/2018.

At the end of the day, the *access* to guns seems to be the biggest issue. Or the idea of what a ""self defense"" weapon is. 

People always talk about ""Drawing my gun!"" in self defense, and seem to paint every situation with this very easy to fix mentality of ""well, I would have shot the guy, *then* called the cops because they are too slow"". 

Okay, so in this scenario, sure. You turn, the guy is standing in the doorway, and you shoot him. Hopefully, you're better than about 80% of the people I know with guns who intend to defend themselves and you actually do *real* effective training. Hopefully you're not that person who goes to the range once or twice a spring and pops off a few magazines while standing still from 10 yards away. Hopefully you actually practice really firing from under stress, and practice hitting moving targets. Hopefully you work on putting your rounds into a very small target window to practice with hitting a target the size of a shoe box from 20 yards while you're sweating, your heart rate is through the roof, and you're getting a serious case of tunnel vision. 

I say hopefully for all of that, because otherwise you're just more rounds flying in a small space that are likely hitting innocent people. Not to mention in a case like an active shooter in a mall or school, you're now confusing the police count of targets, and likely going to be the target of other good guys with guns who think they're the only hero and happen to see a guy with a gun wandering the area. 

Hopefully you don't shoot some kid when you miss, because you really never tried to learn to shoot with your other hand. Hopefully, you don't shoot a plainclothes police officer who happened to be on scene and was trying to radio back when you assumed that since he had a gun and he came from the direction of the shooting that he was the bad guy. 

This hypothetical game works both ways.

When the M16 was being tested by ARPA, it was compared against the M2 carbine (which was basically a select fire M1 carbine). Both guns were found to be comparably accurate with semi-automatic fire, but the M16 was more accurate with automatic fire. This was because of the design of the M16's recoil system, not because it had a pistol grip - and as a side note, the ""paratrooper"" M1 carbine had a folding stock and a pistol grip, yet was not any more accurate than a regular M1 carbine. If pistol grips made for a ""more accurate and deadly weapon"", they would have included one on the M2 carbine.

Pistol grips don't make a rifle more accurate. They make it more ergonomic. Pistol grips were in use by the military long before 1959, and traditional rifle grips have been in use by the military long since then, though primarily on bolt-action anti-personnel sniper rifles.

That being said, there's a huge list of reasons why the M16 replaced the M1 rifle as the service weapon of choice. Lower overall weight, smaller size, lower recoil, better recoil management, smaller and lighter cartridges, ease of use, equal accuracy, automatic capability, better reliability, easier field maintenance, fewer moving parts, and better support for accessories.

I feel like I would be a responsible gun owner and I have faith that I will get my rights back someday. Maybe 30 years from now but then I can at least go hunting.

This is actually a great example of a stigma that has gone too far, every time there is a debate on gun control, there is an argument with something related to mental health, to the point of even blaming the mentally ill for causing such shootings. It is absolute bullshit and unfair, considering specific few people are being represented for the whole ""mental illness"" crown.",Mental health is so stigmatized that it s not even funny  I am legally diagnosed with Undifferentiated Schizophrenia  which is now under great control  In my opinion  one of the biggest,4.0,TickleMeSmallz 4,MentalhealthissostigmatizedthatitsnotevenfunnyIamlegallydiagnosedwithUndifferentiatedSchizophreniawhichisnowundergreatcontrolInmyopiniononeofthebiggest,1494.684,1602.822

If the sales man didn't run a background and illegally sold the gun to him then he is partly responsible for this and should have his license removed and he should be barred from selling guns again, which could help in the future.

It is very likely that they will assuming that they were at fault. It is possible that they did everything by the books and the background check was wrong, but more likely than not they are already lawyered up knowing that they're about to have the ATF come down on them.

&gt; Do authorities invest resources in finding and arresting these kinds of crooked sellers? 

Yes. Just google ""ATF FFL bust"" and you'll see reports of undercover operations busting FFLs selling firearms illegally. 

Sidenote: A common issue people run into is wanting to buy firearms as a gift for a family member (often a husband buying their wife a gun). If you even hint to the FFL that this is your intention, expect the FFL to turn you away. While what you're doing is most likely an innocent gesture, by selling the gun to you, they would be responsible for a straw sale (FFL sells a firearm to someone who intends to give or sell the gun to someone else effectively bypassing background checks). They know that something as innocuous as that could be a sting or get reported by a customer who knows that it is illegal and would land the FFL in deep shit. Seriously, if you're ever at a gun store and see someone suggest that the gun is for a friend, everyone within 50 feet will suddenly be watching how the rest of that conversation goes.

&gt; Do they do random undercover stings where they try to buy guns with bad background records and see if the seller sells it anyways?

Honestly I do not know if they try this. I would have to assume so. The ATF is known for not screwing around. They bust bars all the time for illegal alcohol sales and they definitely enforce gun laws.

https://www.cafe.com/from-preet-on-gun-control-with-john-miller/

Who is John Miller?

The Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism at the NYPD. Over the course of his career in law enforcement and journalism, he has taken on terrorism in New York, served in the FBI, and interviewed mobsters and murderers from John Gotti to Osama bin Laden.

&gt; John Miller: I think there is. You know, if you look at this conversation, it’s been stuck for a long time. You’ve got a powerful gun lobby. You’ve got members of Congress who benefit from them tremendously, and you have very little progress in gun laws. But as I argued before a congressional committee some time ago, I always thought, well, when members of Congress start getting shot, that’ll change. But Gabby Giffords was shot down in a parking lot at a campaign stop. Congressman Scalise was recently severely wounded in a similar incident. So, we know that’s not the breaker there.

&gt;I thought, well, you know, when we go with our families to the mall or the movies and we’re being in massacred in numbers there, that that would be the breaking point, and we’d get serious about this conversation. But we had a shooting at the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado during the Batman premiere, where women and children and men were killed when they were out with their families to have fun. And that conversation lasted a very short time and resulted in nothing. The governor tried his own gun laws there and was run out in the next election for it.

&gt; And then I thought, when they massacre our babies in their kindergarten classes, our little children, that will be when we ask ourselves, can we continue with this madness? But that happened, and nothing changed there either. So, I guess we know who we are and what’s important to us. **If our guns are more important than our elected officials, more important than our families at the mall, more important than our children in school, even when they’re in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them, shouldn’t have been able to obtain them, people who are emotionally disturbed where that’s been documented—if that’s who we are, I think we need to ask why. I think we should all be asking a question: what makes sense? And it’s not the question we’re asking.**",John Miller was on Preet Bharara s podcast after the Las Vegas shooting  He had this to say on gun control  Here is his response to Preet asking him  whether there,4.0,dolche93 4,JohnMillerwasonPreetBhararaspodcastaftertheLasVegasshootingHehadthistosayonguncontrolHereishisresponsetoPreetaskinghimwhetherthere,2418.286,3684.292

Consider how some places in the US have billboards advertising fully automatic UZI SMGs. Think about that bank that gives out rifles to people who open new accounts. Buying and owning a weapon and even carrying it openly in the US is as casual as riding a bike on the sidewalk. It's expected, in fact. It's unquestionably understood due to a ""right to bear arms"".

 The thing is, it's not doing anyone any favors and that ""right to bear arms"" was thought up in a time much different than the now. If you replace the obsession America has with firearms with an equal obsession strictly for grenade launchers, for example, does it still seem like a necessity? My point being a non-self defense (anything but a pistol) non-hunting related weapon is a weapon is a weapon and if it seems like a bad idea to strap everybody with grenade launchers but not rifles: there's something there that is worth thinking about.

As an outsider looking in, it looks like It's a problem that stems from a culture driven by fear and hatred. So many people are angry due to the wage gap and modern slavery and how little support there is for mental health generally unless you have money. There definitely exists a deep seeded desensitization to weapons and aggression. 

It's cool if you find firearms fascinating as machines or if you genuinely enjoy target shooting like someone who enjoys archery enjoys the sport; but if you own a gun for any other reason other than hunting or self defense (no, you do not need an automatic rifle with a high powered military scope, laser sight, drum mag and bipod as a self defense weapon)... ask yourself why.

The fact is everyone, or the vast majority, wants a society full of healthy people. The way of doing this is either universal healthcare provided by the government or a health insurance system that works the way it is supposed to. 

The health insurance system would be ideal since competition would theoretically lower cost and improve quality. But that hasn't happened. Instead manipulative billing, unrealistic prices, and the possibility of still ending up bankrupt even with insurance all point to that system failing. 

The alternative is government provided healthcare available to anyone, which sounds like a paradise, but is vulnerable to the same price gouging as private insurers. 

There needs to be a complete reform of medical care in the US before either system will work. Incentivize people to *prevent* illness, instead of just run to a doctor to treat it. 

That type of change won't happen with the stroke of a legislator's pen though. The first step I would like to see is some kind of tax credit or subsidy for things like gym memberships, diet or nutritional programs, pet ownership, ethics courses, etc.

Bad Conduct Discharge (BCD)[edit]
A Bad Conduct Discharge (BCD), can only be given by a court-martial (either special or general) as punishment to an enlisted service-member. Bad conduct discharges are often preceded by a period of confinement in a military prison. The discharge itself is not executed until completion of both confinement and the appellate review process.

Virtually all veterans' benefits are forfeited by a Bad Conduct Discharge; BCD recipients are not eligible for VA disability compensation in accordance with 38 CFR 3.12.

Dishonorable[edit]
A dishonorable discharge (DD) can only be handed down to an enlisted member by a general court-martial. Dishonorable discharges are handed down for what the military considers the most reprehensible conduct. This type of discharge may be rendered only by conviction at a general court-martial for serious offenses (e.g., desertion, sexual assault, murder, etc.) that call for dishonorable discharge as part of the sentence.

With this characterization of service, all veterans' benefits are lost, regardless of any past honorable service, and this type of discharge is regarded as shameful in the military. In many states a dishonorable discharge is deemed the equivalent of a felony conviction, with attendant loss of civil rights.[16] Additionally, US federal law prohibits possession of firearms by those who have been dishonorably discharged[17] per the Gun Control Act of 1968.",A Bad Conduct Discharge and a Dishonorable Discharge are two completely different things  Bad Conduct Discharge  BCD  edit  A Bad Conduct Discharge  BCD   can only be given by a court martial  either,4.0,shiftdnb 4,ABadConductDischargeandaDishonorableDischargearetwocompletelydifferentthingsBadConductDischargeBCDeditABadConductDischargeBCDcanonlybegivenbyacourtmartialeither,2993.776,3533.296

Gun control issues are hottly debated topics and my asking you in this reply is not demonizing nor finger pointing at you.  Just wanting to ask questions based on your comment and get your opinion or the opinions of others.  

I agree with you that he purchased his gun illegally, and that if the current laws worked, he should not have had a gun. 

I do wonder though if the prevalence of guns and the easy of getting them in the US, is enabling those who want to kill other people.  Most gun owners are lawful citizens, but some are not and that can lead to tragic consequences.  Would you support harsher penlties on the individuals who illegally sold the gun(s) and or used them for violence?  And if so, how much harsher?  Currently there are laws making the detailed tracking of firearm sales in the US difficult at best.  Would you support changes to those laws to help law enforcement enforce the current laws?

An example of why I am thinking along these lines.  Most people who drink alcohol are responsible with it, but some are not.  It is not an apples for apples comparison, but I think you will get where I am going.  In the 1970's driving drunk was illegal, but the consequences for breaking the laws against drinking and driving were far less sever than they are today.  Many people had multiple DUI convictions and were still able to keep their drivers license.  Today if you are caught drinking and driving massive fines and jail time are regularly handed out, along with the mandatory loss of a license.  That has led to a significant drop in drunk driving arrests and also drunk driving fatalities.  Note that the harsh fines and penalties does not stop someone from getting behind the wheel of a car while drunk, but we have seen a significant decrease in DUIs and fatal alcohol related accidents.

The question is: what percentage of gun crime involves weapons that were purchased illegally from abroad or using the darknet at some point?

For example, I forget the exact statistic, but finding unmarked, foreign weapons in the hands of a random street criminal is fairly rare due to the cost (a pistol purchased at a gun shop is very cheap) and most criminals can find some chain of people through which they can acquire these small firearms, even if they themselves cannot purchase the gun directly.  Also keep in mind that mass shootings tend to be carried out with legally acquired weapons.

Now, eliminating that common market may drive more criminals to purchase from the darkweb instead, but that is much more expensive.  It is likely that some criminals would be priced out of acquiring firearms, while some would not.

In my opinion, though, the problem isn't even internet vs. non-internet firearms.  Suppose we banned all firearms tomorrow.  What do we do, logistically, about the literal millions of firearms already out there?  This doesn't mean that there should be no regulation or barriers to acquisition (making firearms much harder to acquire would probably help a lot), but it is a concern.

You made some really good points, and I guess I didn't consider that yes, there are a lot of shootings with guns that can be obtained legally. I guess what I'm trying to say is, if we *did* ban it, people would just go to the deepweb and the flow of guns wouldn't change. I can buy a Barretta with ammo for $600 on the deep web (I just checked). And I can buy a fully automatic machine gun for $2000-$6000 depending on what kind you want. That's not very expensive, especially since you can still buy in bulk, dropping those prices I just listed by up to 20-30%. 

You're right, the next big problem after banning guns is confiscating guns, which couldn't happen. Every gun owner would either demand money in exchange, or would hide their guns and claim they did away with them. Very few gun owners would be willing to hand their guns over. And 0 criminals would. And that's where the deep web comes in. We already have all these guns circulating, it's just that new guns will come from a new source, rather than how they were obtained before. 

What I'm getting at, is if people want a gun, I guarantee they'll get a gun. Just like if people really want drugs, or organs, or passports, or fake ID's, etc.  I think there are a lot of issues that need to be sorted out, and I think just ""banning guns"" won't solve it. 6 years after the UK banned guns, gun related homicides had gone up 89%. Homicides in general shot up too. Meaning even after guns were banned, their gun killings almost doubled. I'm not saying banning guns = killing more people, but it just goes
To show that if someone wants a gun, they'll get one. 

I doubt they care too much if a gun is $500 more since they don't really have a need for money after killing several people. 

And like I said- killers will be killers. Take away their guns and it's knives or bombs. Bombs can be made with Walmart ingredients.

Republicans are increasingly reliant on ‘alternative facts’ manufactured by the likes of Fox News and Breitbart, which claim that global warming isn’t real and neither is the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee. The real scandal, they tell us, is the Steele dossier paid for by the Democrats in an attempt to uncover Trump’s Russian connections. Or is it the evidence-free claim that Obama supposedly wiretapped Trump?

&gt;In the final analysis, no indictment of their candidate will convince the faithful. As Trump once said, ‘I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters’ Or, more to the point, Roy Moore could molest a 14-year-old girl and not lose votes. Because for Republican partisans, their opponents are ‘the forces of evil,’ and anything is preferable to that. Even Donald Trump. Even Roy Moore. So in ostensibly fighting evil, Republicans have become complicit in it.

Numbers?  I'm fairly certain that Sanders supporters are in indivisible and resist too.

And, while yes, there are crazy Sanders-supporters out there—there are idiots in S4P and ESS—for the *sane* Sanders-supporters, I think you're confusing ""criticizing the DNC"" with ""attack[ing] the party.""

And, even still, there are tons of Sanders supporters who don't bother criticizing the DNC, because they're not engaged, don't care, or don't think there's anything to criticize. Are you going to kick them out too?

&gt;The future of the party doesn't belong to people who are still stuck in the 2016 primary &amp; trying to draw blood over it.

Some suggestions from another reddit thread -  askreddit- 

what about guns and gun ownership would like to understand better 

I asked a few questions in this subject and got some helpful answers, whilst not a gun owner myself I do wonder about the safeguards in place over ownership of firearms. I am not against the guns but would like better regulations and training for those with guns. 

American gun laws could use a bit of a review, when compared to 2 other countries in this case Sweden and Canada, the common theme is training and different types of licence.

The idea that you need to start with a small firearm and work up to larger more dangerous ones seems logical, training to use and maintain each type of gun, seems only sensible. And having to wait longer for more dangerous types of gun and licenses for them,  seems to be a way forward.

Guns kill it's a fact no matter what size a .22 will leave you just as dead as an AR15, the people behind the gun need to be better trained and educated.

In Sweden it works like this:

We have two types of licenses; hunting and sport. Each individual firearm will have a separate license tied to it.

You can hunt and compete with a firearm you have on a hunting license, but you can only do sport shooting with a firearm you have on a hunting license.

There are some firearms you can only get on a sporting license. You can get some firearms that are common for hunting on a sporting license as well but that's uncommon (no real point usually, since then you can't use it for for hunting).

To get a firearm on a hunting license the requirement is that you have a Swedish hunting exam and are 18 years of age. The exam is not that hard.

To get a firearm on a sporting license, you need to be a member of a club, and the club needs to write a certification for each firearm you want to own, that you send in to the police together with your license application.

To write the certification there are requirements that varies depending on the shooting organization the club belongs to, but usually it's at least 6 months assuming it's your first gun (for a simple .22lr target pistol) to 1 year (for a handgun in a larger caliber than .22lr), to 2 years (for something like an AR15).

For me to get another handgun I'd contact my club and ask for a certificate (I got the requirements needed), and they'll send it to the police. The license application takes between 1 day (unrealistic) to about 6 weeks where I am; though the time depends on how much they have to do and what time of the year it is (vacations etc gets in the way). When I got the license I'll just go and get the gun.

The club will also teach you everything regarding safety, etc.

For me, I have 5 firearms on a hunting license (1 shotgun, and then 4 rifles in various calibers for different game), and 5 on sport shooting (4 handguns, all for different shooting disciplines) and 1 shotgun.

You can in theory get a license for protection, but it's so rare and restricted that it's basically non-existent. In general you can't even own pepper spray for the purpose of self defense, here.

We have a fair amount of firearms in Sweden. Very little crime with legal weapons though (1-2 legal firearms out of 1.6 million are used in a violent crime each year). There is a relative large amount of gang shootings in recent years, but they get their firearms on the black market and those are smuggled in from Eastern Europe. (A BIG THANK YOU TO SAXIT)

And then

In Canada there are 2 types of licenses, PAL (non-restricted) and RPAL (restricted). These licenses are separately trained and to be applied. There is a third one, carrying license for restricted (pistols) but only for LE or people working outdoor in the wild. To pick up training on PAL or RPAL you can head to almost any range in the country and they will offer full courses on firearm safety, handling and knowledge. After taking these courses, you can then apply for a license. As long as you are a citizen, clear of any crime or mental health record. (if you have criminal record but not a felon, you can apply for a license if you are cleared of any doing for at least 5 years, same applies for mental health) Underages with 16 or above can also apply for special license.

You CANNOT use firearms as self-defense against a person, other than non-restricted against wild animals. The moment you point a gun at somebody, losing your license is the least you get, it would land you in jail for very long time. Restricted weapons can only used at range, and store safely at home in locker. You cannot have a loaded weapon in your car or home. There are no restriction of how many firearms you can own or ammo you can store. All gun stores must require extensive background check and your license every time you buy, sell or trade firearm/ammo.(A BIG THANK YOU TO ProleLivesMatter)

I am a pro-gun control, card-carrying democrat, but I gotta agree that the Democratic Party has advocated for and passed legislation totally counter to OP's meme'd sentiment. An example of what I'm talking about can be found in the now-defunct Democrat-backed Federal Assault Weapons Ban: the ban on barrel shrouds. This specific piece of legislation was not aimed at controlling people, it was aimed at a particular piece of ""technology"" (if you want to call it that). The anti-gun control people expressed confusion at the ban on barrel shrouds, as the shrouds are a cosmetic feature that to have not been proven to make guns any more or less deadly. Under this law, the shroud attachment can be detached from a gun, the gun is suddenly legal, but no less deadly or dangerous. To make matters worse, a Democratic politician who was asked to explain this ban's purpose were unable to accurately describe what a barrel shroud is or does: https://youtu.be/9rGpykAX1fo

There are other examples, like bans on specific types of ammunition (as /u/munginyourmouth hinted at). Some of those bans seem similarly contradictory to OP, as people could just buy different bullets for the same guns.

Again, I am pro-gun control. My point is not pro-gun. I just find OP's image totally disingenuous and misguided.

LSD is illegal, yet it’s not common anymore because it takes an experienced and well-equipped chemist to make it. In this case the ban serves its purpose.

They create a culture of irresponsible gun owners and a lot of deaths are just from that. 

I'm not all that convinced anything but an assault weapon ban will do much and really I'm not convinced we'd be talking about lowering the total amount of gun deaths all that much. 

Personally I'd want to focus on lowering gun deaths overall, not simply lowering mass shootings. If I can get less total gun deaths but more mass shootings, that would be a reasonable improvement. 

How many actual people per year are we talking about saving if we ban assault weapons? 5000? It's not like mass killing people is going to be all that hard just because assault weapons aren't sold everywhere. 

I think the very concept of mass killing people has gotten more popular and while we may reduce it some, I think it will also shift to other means.

So, the point is, there is nothing that even resembles a workable solution that I can see other than states and cities get on the ball to use local community power to weed these people out before they act. Parents, friends and neighbors are probably the most realistic means we have to stop crazy people before they act. 

Everything is give and take, how much political capital do you want to spend to save X amount of people? 

I'd rather focus on Medicare for all and mental healthcare because it will save a TON more people and investing our efforts into gun control might not do much of anything or it might take years to see the impact. 

We have gerrymandering, healthcare and Russian hacking to worry about... why add impossible to pass gun laws? That's just going to hurt the Democrats in 2018 if they go for a national gun control effort. 

Don't let yourselves get divided on too many issues, especially ones that aren't super marketable.

Kinda like DACA now (which I work on), with the wall + ending family reunification for DREAMER parents as part of a deal even when Trump and DHS is saying it'll kill immigration enforcement and essentially lead to terrorism. Or even further than that, that the best solution to unauthorized immigration beyond immediately fixing the fucked up system of immigration, that we Ensure México and central/South America is prospering enough to avoid most of the human made reasons people migrate. Just so skeptical after field organizing for a few years. Regardless even if a slight utopia were possible we should still have firearm reform like a UBC, plus new reporting for severely aggressive and dangerous mental illnesses in schools and workplaces and relationships.

However, In no utopia does the dude who beats the fuck out of his wife weekly then should be able to still buy an AK-47 while still being a recent ex (violent) convict. Because my dad was paid really well when he was in and out of jail/prison at the time and bought an AK 47 at a gun show (with me) and destroyed so much shit in our backyard (with me) that he got so scared of it that he got rid of it, a few months before (after anger therapy) putting a guy into a coma by stomping on his face after a bar fight (with me getting arrested with him).

Sorry this so long it not an easy subject this is just to open discussion. I have posted this on a few sites not looking for karma just looking for change.

Some suggestions from another reddit thread -  askreddit- 

what about guns and gun ownership would like to understand better 

I asked a few questions in this subject and got some helpful answers, whilst not a gun owner myself I do wonder about the safeguards in place over ownership of firearms. I am not against the guns but would like better regulations and training for those with guns. 

American gun laws could use a bit of a review, when compared to 2 other countries in this case Sweden and Canada, the common theme is training and different types of licence.

The idea that you need to start with a small firearm and work up to larger more dangerous ones seems logical, training to use and maintain each type of gun, seems only sensible. And having to wait longer for more dangerous types of gun and licenses for them,  seems to be a way forward.

Guns kill it's a fact no matter what size a .22 will leave you just as dead as an AR15, the people behind the gun need to be better trained and educated.

In Sweden it works like this:

We have two types of licenses; hunting and sport. Each individual firearm will have a separate license tied to it.

You can hunt and compete with a firearm you have on a hunting license, but you can only do sport shooting with a firearm you have on a hunting license.

There are some firearms you can only get on a sporting license. You can get some firearms that are common for hunting on a sporting license as well but that's uncommon (no real point usually, since then you can't use it for for hunting).

To get a firearm on a hunting license the requirement is that you have a Swedish hunting exam and are 18 years of age. The exam is not that hard.

To get a firearm on a sporting license, you need to be a member of a club, and the club needs to write a certification for each firearm you want to own, that you send in to the police together with your license application.

To write the certification there are requirements that varies depending on the shooting organization the club belongs to, but usually it's at least 6 months assuming it's your first gun (for a simple .22lr target pistol) to 1 year (for a handgun in a larger caliber than .22lr), to 2 years (for something like an AR15).

For me to get another handgun I'd contact my club and ask for a certificate (I got the requirements needed), and they'll send it to the police. The license application takes between 1 day (unrealistic) to about 6 weeks where I am; though the time depends on how much they have to do and what time of the year it is (vacations etc gets in the way). When I got the license I'll just go and get the gun.

The club will also teach you everything regarding safety, etc.

For me, I have 5 firearms on a hunting license (1 shotgun, and then 4 rifles in various calibers for different game), and 5 on sport shooting (4 handguns, all for different shooting disciplines) and 1 shotgun.

You can in theory get a license for protection, but it's so rare and restricted that it's basically non-existent. In general you can't even own pepper spray for the purpose of self defense, here.

We have a fair amount of firearms in Sweden. Very little crime with legal weapons though (1-2 legal firearms out of 1.6 million are used in a violent crime each year). There is a relative large amount of gang shootings in recent years, but they get their firearms on the black market and those are smuggled in from Eastern Europe. (A BIG THANK YOU TO SAXIT)

And then

In Canada there are 2 types of licenses, PAL (non-restricted) and RPAL (restricted). These licenses are separately trained and to be applied. There is a third one, carrying license for restricted (pistols) but only for LE or people working outdoor in the wild. To pick up training on PAL or RPAL you can head to almost any range in the country and they will offer full courses on firearm safety, handling and knowledge. After taking these courses, you can then apply for a license. As long as you are a citizen, clear of any crime or mental health record. (if you have criminal record but not a felon, you can apply for a license if you are cleared of any doing for at least 5 years, same applies for mental health) Underages with 16 or above can also apply for special license.

You CANNOT use firearms as self-defense against a person, other than non-restricted against wild animals. The moment you point a gun at somebody, losing your license is the least you get, it would land you in jail for very long time. Restricted weapons can only used at range, and store safely at home in locker. You cannot have a loaded weapon in your car or home. There are no restriction of how many firearms you can own or ammo you can store. All gun stores must require extensive background check and your license every time you buy, sell or trade firearm/ammo.(A BIG THANK YOU TO ProleLivesMatter)

Both these countries have better gun laws than the US, I'm not saying copy them exactly, however if we view the gun laws of countries with low gun crime and incidents like the 18 school shootings.  We need a review of current gun control and an increase in controls. 

If you want guns fine, but everybody else has to have some safeguards too.  With current shootings not just in schools like Vegas, the onus is now on the gun user to prove he is competent, capable and mentally sound to own a gun.  Certain types of weapons and equipment e.g. bump stock's need to be restricted as there is just no need for them unless you are in the military or national guard.

The lessening of regulation needs reversed that one piece of trump legislation which undid restrictions aimed at mental illness, and now with his usual incompetence budget cuts reducing safeguards even further!! 

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s newly unveiled budget would cut millions of dollars from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which gun dealers use to verify if someone is banned from buying a gun before selling it to them.

Buried on Page 719 of his fiscal year 2019 budget, released Monday, the president calls for cuts to the National Criminal Records History Improvement Program and the NICS Act Record Improvement Program. Both provide federal grants to states to help them improve their reporting of criminal records and protection orders to the national database for background checks, including domestic violence records

Get out and VOTE 

You'll need less republicans in the houses if you want gun control, how much do you love your children?

18 shootings in 45 days, 1 every 2.5 days; imagine that over a year that's 146 school shootings at this rate !

I repeat how much do you love your children?

OK, but didn't the DOJ determined that a ban on such things would have minimal impact? Targeting that is common sense, but not good or effective policy. Nice hill to die on though next election. 

Edit:

&gt;&gt; the ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at
best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. AWs were rarely used in
gun crimes even before the ban. LCMs are involved in a more substantial share
of gun crimes, but it is not clear how often the outcomes of gun attacks depend on
the ability of offenders to fire more than ten shots (the current magazine capacity
limit) without reloading

Especially after such heart wrenching speeches from the victims of such a tragedy.

***My immediate thoughts at arming teachers with guns were...***

If I have a teacher who has a gun in their desk **I would fear them**.  Though I might feel safer initially until I had a falling out with them as it would be always be a dynamic in our relationship. 

The person charged with inspiring me...would be someone I would fear on a much deeper level than getting an #F. Everytime they sat at their desk  it be in my mind...the loaded gun possibly in their desk....not the books on mine.

**Fear.  More fear in schools already besieged by fear.**

Any gun in school has circumvented security and is now in the 'what if' risk zone, as there are no safe guns.

* What happens if the teacher forgets to lock the gun box / desk cabinet or the lock fails?

* Or the kids break in to the gun storage for a gag or out of malice. A loaded guns already in schools waiting to be fired by anyone.

* What happens if the gun is stolen or lost on site ? (That really happens in all gun zones at times).

* What if the teacher has a breakdown (as they do).  They are armed and ready to kill themselves or their colleagues or the children.

* What if the teacher drops the gun in a fight with an intruder?...the gunman has 1 more gun or a student has a loaded gun becoming a target or worse a an accidental shooter due to lack of training.

* Maybe the teacher is drinking, confused , disgruntled or mistaken and pulls a loaded gun on an innocent person?

* What happens if the teacher misses the intruder and hits a student or another teacher or parent?

* What if intruders bring more guns in escalation to the guns on site and the hallways become shootouts.  Or the teachers or their families are targeted in advance.

* Maybe the teacher uses the fear of having a gun to coherse students for sexual favors? (Has happens for grades so why not guns).

* What happens if the teacher who has known / taught the child for maybe ten years hesitates or that known hesitation is used against them by the child killer ?

* What if intentional death by (cop) teacher becomes a thing? Students and others seeking a quick death by a jumpy inexperienced teacher.

*Yes 'ifs and maybes' though all possible and all too likely in a future where our educators are gun toting police soldiers.*

**Every bad idea** in Trumps head (or put in there by his collegues or Fox News) combined to make his suggestion on arming teachers a  dangerous and ignorant statement in my opinion.  'Violence begets violence' and more guns is not a civil solution but it does demostrate a total failure to appreciate the intricacies of the situation (and maybe a lack of care for his countries children).

Surely the most conflicting part of President Trumps suggestion is not that he previously (2016 Twitter) publically stated he didn't want guns in school.   Or that he is not a gun user who has young child in school himself but that he claims the blame lies with mental health.  At the same time he is seen arguing that the children who are killers are 'cowards who would fear a gun zone'.  The latter implies these 'insane children' are rational enough to fear that risk.  Which is ofcourse rarely true if they are mentally incapacitated to the point that they are willing to kill their friends and teachers...and themselves.   They are unlikely to be afraid of being shot.  

**You can't have it both ways President Trump.**

Times magazine recently ran an article about teachers views on this.  A former Marine Corps captain turned teacher was interviewed and her comment on President Trumps suggestion was, 

***“It’s an insane idea. To anyone who’s ever taught before, it’s just ludicrous,”.***

These kids aren't trying to be experts - all they are doing is saying there is a problem and they are asking the 'experts' to try and solve it instead of ignoring it like history shows. They have not put forward a bill outlining what should be done, they are saying something needs to be done. And they are asking the experts to do it.


&gt; Democrats seem to be the ones listing, is because it supports their political agenda to ban guns

I disagree, I feel Democrats want to ban guns for the same reason these kids do. Sure its an ideology, but i don't think its an political agenda. If they were looking to gain anything politically then they would be taking donations from the NRA and pushing to keep the same laws. Guns are available to an excess without the proper checks which is obviously causing unnecessary  social issues and repeated tragedy. So people that are for gun control are purely having an opinion on the situation. Not everything has to be for political advantage. 

&gt; After those events followed cries for gun reform and gun control but to my knowledge, nothing really changed. Well anyone who seeks these gun changes saw the opportunity to try and use children as a political club to beat anyone who doesn't agree with them or does not want gun reform.

I protested against my country entering the iraqi war with the US and UK in my small regional town when I was 12. I also attended one against a proposed coal mine and against Manus Island. Some people, kids or not are just wired to fight for what they believe in - especially if it has caused devastation and tragedy to them directly.

2) Officer is shot dead by the attacker. RW media focuses on the heroic duty the officer performed, gives thoughts and prayers, and attacks anyone who points out that the officer was unable to stop the gun man as seizing on tragedy to push an agenda.""Why do you hate police!""

3) Officer lives and doesn't kill or stop the attacker, RW media shames the officer publicly and acts as if they were responsible for the horrors committed. ""That coward of an officer let the babies die!"" Vows to arm students and teachers, maybe even require AR-15s for the security officers.

That's what they signed up for. If he stood there with the power to possibly save some of those kids and didn't use it, he is a coward. Yes, by law they have the right to save themselves before others in a crisis situation, but then what's the point of having officers, when they can leave us defenseless to save themselves? I think arming teachers is a great idea, because 1. Only teachers that are proven to be mentally stable and can pass all the gun training stuff are allowed to have one, 2. Only schools that believe they are at risk and that it is necessary for need to have teachers with guns, it is not something being forced on the school systems, 3. AFAIK, there is a rule that only a certain amount of teachers per hallway can carry guns, and none of the other teachers are told which teachers have the guns. I guess that could cause teachers with guns to shoot at eachother, but obviously rules and protocols for how this is going to work haven't been set in stone and can be improved. 4. If in that school, say 6 teachers were carrying guns, do you think that many children would have died? Its sad that we have to even consider the option of teachers shooting their own students, shooting the children that they see and teach every day, and in my mind that's the only thing that would cause a teacher to hesitate in a moment that hesitiation couldn't be an option. A lot of people would say that a good person with a gun and a bad person with a gun doesn't help anything, and I completely disagree with that. Its the way the world is that major arguments and conflicts are settled by fighting, that's obvious. Frankly, the people that think getting rid of guns entirely are small minded in my opinion, because then it's very possible that crime will go up with gangs trying to get firearms illegally, and then the general public will be defensless. There's people that say we should simply ban AR's, and I completely agree with that. I doubt the people that wrote the second amendment imagined something like this happening, but from a different standpoint, if we ban AR's, what's to stop shooters from just using pistols? Then we'll have a ban guns entirely problem in the US, and that's something we certainly don't need in a country built on liberty and honor.

Universal Background checks:
You simply can’t enforce background checks for all private sales, those who were looking for a way around the law will just not get a background check. It’s like mandating all drug dealers have their clients present a drivers license, some are simply not going to do it.

Modernizing the ATF:
They already have registries in Illinois, but they found he vast vast majority of cases the weapon used in a homicide was illegally obtained or was used by someone other than the registered owner.


Fund the CDC:
The CDC could always do research for it, they just wouldn’t have funding for that program if they did. Even the , we have FBI stats on homicides overall and weapons used in them (vast majority are with handguns, followed by knives, unidentified firearms, fists, shotguns, rifles)

High Capacity magazine ban:
It didn’t stop Parkland (the shooter used smaller 10 round magazines on purpose, they are more concealable). It didn’t stop Santa Fe (the shooter used a shotgun and a .38, neither holds more than 8 rounds)
“Oh but what about 100 drum mags”
If anything, I’d want a shooter to use drum mags, as in both instances I can recall a drum mag being used in a crime (Aurora and that one Heist in North Vegas), both times the rifle jammed and the user ditched it for a different weapon. Drum mags are notorious for jamming often (several times in a single magazine, which is why he military doesn’t use them).

Ban assault weapons:
An “assault weapon” as used by gun control advocates is a misnomer. Actual military rifles, such as the M4A1 carbine, have 3-position fire selectors. That means you can set it to safe, semiautomatic (1 trigger pull means 1 round fired), and fully automatic (the gun fires for as long as you hold the trigger and have ammo).

Civilian variants however, only have 2 position fire sectors, safe and semi. They also have narrower lower receivers (the part legally recognized as the gun), meaning you can’t fit a military automatic sear into it. So gun control advocates needed to redefine what assault weapon meant.

So in response, the Clinton Ban (1994-2004) banned:
Semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines with 2 or more features:

Foregrip (a piece of plastic you can hold onto)

Pistol grip (another piece of plastic you hold onto)

Bayonet lug (a metal piece that allows you to mount a knife onto the barrel without duct tape)

Grenade launcher mount (slots and cuts in the gun that allow you to mount a grenade launcher, which are already restricted, without duct tape

Threaded barrel which can mount a flashhider (this device largely just keeps dirt from blowing into your face while firing prone. And while it can “hide” flash, flashes are pretty much invisible in the daytime, and in the darkest of nights you’ll still see a flash, maybe not as big though. However, the gun is still loud, you hear the gun shot and the bullet breaking the sound barrier)

Just another fun fact about the Clinton Ban, overall rifle deaths declined after the ban expired.



But looking over their policies, even presuming the “worked”, none of them would have stopped shootings like Virginia Tech, Columbine (which happened during the Clinton Ban), Santa Fe, YouTube, and so on.



I’m not saying what they went through means nothing, it’s terrible to lose people like that, but it would seem gun free zones don’t work, and that relying on the police alone will fail you (jut like it did at Parkland).

The tldr is that the estimates are way low due to lack of mobility for counting (mud slides for example) accounting for a few, lack of power, water, and access to healthcare. 

Basically if the survey respondents said that someone died and they lacked phone service at the time, then it was attributed to the storm due to the lack of emergency services. Pretty smart approach. 


However it IS a direct survey and has those inherent problems. You poll people on virgin births and extrapolate like this, we should have a half-million Messiahs in the US. You poll regarding self defense gun use, you get an elevated rate that doesn’t match data and other polling methods. 

So take the 5000 number (actually reported as 4600) with a grain of salt. It is the upper limit, probably that is almost certainly high.

BY JOHN BOWDEN - 05/31/18 11:13 AM EDT

Former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ill.) said Thursday that the Republican Party has been completely co-opted by President Trump.

In an interview following his address at the Makinac Policy Conference 2018 in Michigan, the former House Speaker accused his fellow Republicans of abandoning their political ideals for those professed by Trump.

""There is no Republican party. There’s a Trump party. The Republican Party is kinda taking a nap somewhere,"" Boehner said. In the interview, Boehner added that Trump was clearly the ""most unusual"" president the country had ever seen.

""It's too divided,"" Boehner said of the Trump administration, explaining why he did not want to return to Congress.

&gt;LAPIERRE: Now, the National Rifle Association knows there are millions of qualified and active retired police, active, Reserve, and retired military, security professionals, certified firefighters, security professionals, rescue personnel, an extraordinary corps of patriotic, trained, qualified citizens to join with local school officials and police in devising a protection plan for every single school.

&gt;We could deploy them to protect our kids now. We can immediately make America’s schools safer, relying on the brave men and women in America’s police forces. The budgets -- and you all know this, everyone in the country knows this -- of our local police departments are strained, and the resources are severely limited, but their dedication and courage is second to none. And, they can be deployed right now.

Yeah, LaPierre explicitly called on *Congress* to hire and station more police officers, but that's a longer term goal.  When he talks about civilians, 'trained, qualified citizens' who 'can be deployed right now', he's talking about, essentially, *forming militias*.  He's calling on gun owners who consider themselves patriotic, trained, and qualified, to volunteer their services to protect schools.

But you know, here's the problem.  We've *seen* what happens when gun owners with an overinflated sense of 'responsibility' go out on patrol to protect their neighborhoods from crime.  Innocent kids get shot for being black and wearing hoodies.  Hell, I'm not thrilled about the idea of having armed *police* in schools - it tends to lead to stop-and-frisks, locker searches with dogs, enforcing class discipline at gunpoint, and all the other school-to-prison-pipeline customs that are working *so well* in the inner cities - the idea of a bunch of wannabe Rambos jerking it over the idea of shooting a kid and being a hero doesn't thrill me one bit.

Yeah, the whole press release was utter shit - a mental illness registry?  Really?  Because it's fascism for the government to keep a list of gun owners, but a list of people suffering from mental illnesses?

2070,1,7536yz,democratsalvaje,progressive,Las Vegas shooting,1507485009,"Hello fellow progressives. Like many of you and the rest of the United States as well as the world, the event that took place in Las Vegas have been pretty distressing. I am new here but I would like to engage with you all in regards to the shooting. What follows is a rant that I wrote a few days after the shooting. I debated posting it but I am convinced that I make some points that I would like some feedback on. Thanks.

Gun rights people are pretty fucking ballsy when they tell us that we can't talk about gun control when something like this happens. Especially when there's so much to talk about. Think about it, a 64 year old white man just unloaded from the 32nd floor of a hotel, onto a country concert. He killed 59 people and injured 527. If white people marching for white supremacy are just expressing their right to freedom of speech, then people concerned about gun violence can talk about gun control whenever they want, especially in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in US history. Part of having freedom of speech and of the press is that no individual or group can (in most cases) restrict speech regardless of how they feel about it. Now, there are those who have the opinion that bringing up the topic of gun control when these shootings occur is in bad taste, and assume that its being done in order to take advantage of another person’s misery. They are entitled to that opinion, an opinion that is partly accurate. However, just because many on the Left are taking advantage of someones misery, doesn't mean that we are doing to it for the purposes of inflicting more, even it does in the short term. These things happen, the press informs us and in the midst of the horror, we as a people have the right and responsibility to start a discourse about how we can stop this from happening again. Moreover, the idea that one should not profit off of a tactical advantage such as the opening created by the an attack such as this is unfair.  Any politician or activist will tell you that they have a limited amount of time and political capital to expend and these events create space and time that can be used to take action. At the very least pointing out that gun laws as they stand facilitated this attack can make gun rights people as uncomfortable as possible, and they deserve it.

What really leaves me flabbergasted are the responses given by Right and gun rights zealots in the wake of every mass shooting. Besides perpetuating the idea that talking about long guns, high capacity magazines, and after-market modifications is off the table, they rely on other nasty and disrespectful means of deflecting responsibility. These occur in no particular order and are deployed circumstantially. We've already mentioned how they take a false moral high ground. ""Don't talk about gun control right now, just send your thoughts and prayers!"" So that's all well and good, but last time I checked thoughts and prayers aren't bullet proof. It’s also the laziest response. It takes no effort at all to state that you are sending thoughts and prayers. If someone tells me that that's all we can do, all I hear is ""there is no obligation to do anything."" Blow it out your ass. What would we do if we told cancer patients that our thoughts and prayers are with them but their healthcare is too expensive for the nation to do anything about it. Oh shit, they already do. So I guess what lies at the core of the gun rights movement is not really giving a damn about other people. I assume they believe people should be self reliant.

Its this ideological obsession with self reliance that leads us to the second argument they use. ""If only the victims had their own guns, this wouldn't have happened!"" I'm convinced that those who make this argument don't really know what the hell they’re talking about. Lets set aside that in this particular incident the shooter was perched in the 32nd floor of a hotel. Would and armed populace really helped in Orlando or Sandy Hook? The short answer is NO. Maybe if all the teachers and faculty were armed, they would've been able to stop the shooter. That wouldn't have prevented unnecessary death. Moreover, that's a slippery slope. Take a moment and think about what a well armed citizenry making there own decisions about how to implement deadly force would mean. Police and the military are supposed to receive background checks at least 6 months or more of training before being issued firearms. Whether you agree with having an armed police force or having a standing military or not, we can agree that having trained individuals armed to the teeth is better than trusting untrained soccer moms with power over life and death. Besides, these mass shootings were perpetrated by people using high powered semi-automatic rifles, not pistols. Are we all supposed to walk around with AR-15s slung on our shoulders? Imagine the added stress police officers would be under if that was the case.

The third tactic that the right and the gun lobby use to deflect responsibility is to put the blame solely on the person who pulled the trigger. ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people."" According to Ben Shapiro, if Paddock had not had access to guns, then he would've used a truck or a bomb. This is possible and its happened before. However, there is a false equivalency here. Barriers can stop trucks and police and dogs can find bombs, but we couldn't stop Paddock. We'll never be able to stop the human race from trying to kill itself. That's why we have laws and regulations that act as violence mitigators, not eliminators. They keep certain things out of reach so as to prevent murder, not by eliminating murder all together, but by making it harder to commit. What really matters is how we were not able to deny Paddock of the means to commit mass murder, not why he wanted to do it, which we'll never know. So the President gets on Twitter and calls it an act of pure evil, a convenient declaration. 
How can one make policy against evil? Who has the authority on what it means to be evil? How do we evaluate if someone is evil before they gain access to weapons? We can't, we can only deny them access.

As Trevor Noah has pointed out, Fox News is having a hard time coming to grips with the Mandalay Shooting, specifically because of Stephen Paddock’s profile. A white, well to do, 64 year old man who was in good standing with the police in the town he lived in. He was one of their own. In a recent article in the Atlantic, Ta-Nehisi Coates points out the phenomena of neglect on the part of white Americans when it comes to the role they played in the election of Donald Trump. In the article
Coates points out that Trump won all white demographics and that this is indicative of a resilience white Americans have to the terrible things white people do. This idea is difficult to process, but then you see how so may are reacting to the recent shooting. Take the conspiratorial explanation. The idea that shooting was a ""false-flag"" is ridiculous. Yet, many on the right entertain this garbage in order to evade the reality that one of there own killed their own at an event for their own using the weapons that they claim are their own. Perhaps this is a manifestation of the phenomena that Coates was referring to in his article.

I didn’t post this rant in order to propose any policy prescriptions that would solve the problem this country has with gun violence. What I would like to hammer in is that any attempts to clamp down on discourse that seeks to address the very real issues that we are facing as a country is counter-productive and extremely damaging to a populace that is already failing its country when it comes to being educated on issues. Ask yourselves, how many of us knew about modifications such as “bump stocks?” Now the press is rife with discussions and articles on the availability of these modifications and how this availability puts the gun control debate in a new light. This issue is not one that has been created by any wing of the American political community, guns are killing our people. It is as real as it gets. Lets talk about how we can stop it.

They deploy their payload, so to speak, in rapid fire. In the same way that we do not allow truly high-powered race cars on the road, some people question whether they should be just inserted right in the heart of everyday activities. 

They even bear a message: they send the message that violence works. While people clamor about 2nd amendment issues, the message of these things is always the same: that violence is an important, for some the most important option for ""solving"" problems. That the incredible loss involved in violence can be glossed over, that when the bodies go flying, when the ""arms and legs fly"", as a famous general expressed in a statement of a certain unbridled glee about the scene of battle, these do not relate to others, to families being beset with great loss, harming and maiming trauma, that they do not lead to layers upon layers of scar tissue, lifetimes of pain and suffering, extensive effects on related others, including small children in fragile developmental periods.

They are technological advancements; they play right into the basic tendency to put everything into *digital* format: the press of a button, recall, occurs further than in the situation of computer or other automated device. They deliver their own, inherent, rapid-fire special effects. They *wow*: the can fill us with shock and awe. 

They install an *arena*, almost like a sports arena. In their very procedure, their issuance of their payload,  with each operation of their machinery, they install their own mini football field. With each payload, a kind of field with yard lines is laid down, with its own inherent goal-line, over and over again, in rapid fire succession, a small version of the super bowl instantiates itself, holds sway, forces truth into a *non plus ultra* that it is *this* and *nothing else*, second by second. 

They can fire off their payload indiscriminately, to be sure, but may just as well ""target"" based on the color of one's skin as well, either literally or figurative, selecting for either those who are targeted on that basis, or those who are poorer simply at hiding from their powerful ""message"". Woe unto those who are caught unawares, perhaps nursing a child, distracted, or who is not gifted in leaping from one place to another. 

They feed off of a certain complicity that extends much further than either the immediate circumstance or even the explicit agendas associated with their cause. They feed off of, and feed right into, a certain culture, reflected in the logics of everyday thought in countless venues of living, from entertainment to politics to many facets of everyday life to the great, crippled and crippling edifices of the criminal justice system driving rampant materialism, all from behind the scenes yet hiding more in open sight than anything. 

I am referring, of course, to movies like the *Batman* franchise, although what I've said could also be applied to semi-automatic weapons...

So, a couple of things here.  No one doubts Anwar al-Awlaki was a leader of al Qaeda, or that he was behind the Fort Hood shooting, underwear bomb plot, and other similar things.  He made no attempt to conceal that he and his organization were at war with the US.  This is purely an issue of jurisdiction.

In court, the Administration argued that Anwar al-Awlaki was a legitimate target in a war.  For proof of this, they pointed to the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force against al Qaeda and the Taliban, Anwar al-Awlaki's obvious and ongoing activities in al Qaeda, his location overseas and out of the reach of law enforcement, and the fact that no US court has ever (or will ever) enjoin a military campaign overseas because of the Political Question Doctrine guaranteeing Constitutional separation of powers with regard to war.

In response, the ACLU and Awlaki's father argued the 5th amendment, asking the court to grant an injunction on overseas military action, which the court did not have the Constitutional authority to grant, since control of the military rests with the Political branches.

The court also noted that Awlaki's father and the ACLU are not Alwaki, and asked why he didn't appear in court himself.  The plantiffs argued that Awlaki was in hiding fearing for his life and incommunicado, so this was the only way to represent him.  However, the court replied that Awlaki frequently communicates with the outside world to issue threats, and had never expressed an interest in any lawsuit.

So that's what happened.  Ever since then, Glenn Greenwald has been writing articles complaining about it, which Madcat033 then spams to Reddit (which is why you only hear one side).

Here's one from the [top Republican on the finance committee](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/19/gop-sees-mischief-in-jobs-legislation/): 

""It was misleading and would lead to an “extraordinary deviation from current tax policy.”

“There has always been a [tax] deduction allowed for a business’s ordinary and necessary expenses — and expenses associated with moving have always been regarded as deductible business expenses,” Mr. Hatch said Thursday. “As substantive tax policy goes, this proposal is a joke.”

A couple of sites say things similar to this: 

""Republicans objected to the bill in part because Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) blocked GOP amendments to the bill, including a proposal to repeal the 2010 health-care reform act. Some GOP senators also complained that Democrats bypassed the normal committee process and quickly introduced the bill for election-year political purposes.""

I can't find any site that lists all the proposed amendments.

Those are really the only perspectives from Republicans I can find so far. So it turns out ""we've always done it this way"" and ""only if you repeal Obamacare"" are the two reasons I can find.

I never meant to imply that there was any law or procedure that limited the use of the filibuster by Democrats, of course there isn't.

What there **IS** is an institutional problem in the Democratic party that prevents them from actually using it.  That's what I was grousing about.  No hyperbole involved.

Recall, for example, the ""Gang of 14"" that the Democrats came up with as an excuse not to filibuster Bush's worst judicial nominations.  Note that there was no similar compromise offered by the Republicans regarding their most disliked of Obama's nominations (who they have been mercilessly filibustering, along with Obama's efforts to fill his various Executive branch vacancies. His first term is nearly over and the R's have filibustered his nominations so much that he still has empty slots in the various top positions.)

The point is that due to structural differences between the Democratic party and the Republican party [1] the R's are able and willing to make frequent and abusive use of the filibuster while the D's simply aren't willing to do so even as retiliation in order to keep R abuse of the filibuster in check. 

Ergo there is absolutley no political advantage for the Democrats in keeping the filibuster around.  It is a massive boon to the R's, and a massive liability for the D's.  What baffles me is that the D's keep insisting that they have a need to keep the filibuster because maybe one day they might use it.  

History shows that this is not the case.  When the D's lack a majority in the Senate (thus my 49 vote comment), they simply allow the R's to pass anything and everything they desire.  While when the R's have even 41 votes they can, and will, spam the filibuster and essentially shut everything down.

I can certainly see why the R's would want to keep the filibuster, it is one of their most potent weapons in their fight to prevent government from functioning.  What I don't see is why the Democrats are so set on keeping it since it does nothing for them at all.

I'm probably going to get downvoted to hell for this, but whatever.  I AM, however, going to upvote your OP, because I think it's a discussion that is worth having.

Your title question is a bit disingenuous.  There are THOUSANDS of gun discussions going on right now, all across the world.  This thread is one.  r/guns is having a shitload of them.

For a long time, I agreed with you, about how the framers of the Constitution pretty clearly said ""a well-regulated militia"" in the 2nd Amendment, and that private gun ownership outside of hunting was kind of silly.  And then I started reading, talking to people, and generally educating myself better on the subject.  Now, I'm not trying to say you aren't educated on the issue, merely that, when I educated myself, I changed my opinion.

I fully agree with the sentiment that guns don't kill people, people kill people, and that is almost a universally true statement.  A vast, VAST majority of the time, so called accidental shootings are the result of negligence on someone's part, generally the gun owner's.  If I leave my gun unsecured, and a 3 year old kid shoots himself while playing with it, it's my fault because I didn't secure my weapon properly.

The idea that we need to ban so called ""assault weapons"" is, I believe, not a well thought out one.  Let's take Aurora.  The suspect never fired his S&amp;W .223 rifle with a 100 round drum mag.  It jammed.  He only used his shotgun and pistol.  Charles Whitman, the guy who shot a bunch of people from the University of Texas, used a bolt action, 6mm hunting rifle to do a majority of his killing, followed by an M1 carbine.  So, the fact that the Aurora shooter used a semi-automatic rifle, or rather didn't use one, defeats the point of this argument.

The simple fact of the matter is this: I can kill more people with my car than with my gun.  I can run a Greyhound full of people off the Interstate and kill all of them.  I can drive my car through the front window of Starbucks and kill almost everyone inside.  Any person with a driver's license can do that.

You'll never be able to stop crazy people from killing a bunch of innocents in whatever manner possible.  Banning guns isn't going to stop it from it from happening.

Yeah, but I think this is what comes with the territory -- and being involved in a 'war'. Also, I think the fear mongering comes mostly from the *other* party -- as did most of the legislation, either useless or potentially overreaching.

To be fair, there *are* pretty scary, motivated assholes on the other side that get a hard-on at the thought of killing us (or really, many other people as well). For the most part, barring a few handfuls of crazy, we can't see them in the states or even North America -- but they definitely exist and I would go so far as to say that it's not so much about ""not disturbing the hive"" as it is about their particular ideology ultimately seeking to exert influence on everyone else. 

That, and, I still think that ideally, the U.S. should still stand up for what's right and work to stop human rights violations and war crimes.

School shootings in particular make me bring up something I think is pretty controvertial, especially in a conversation framed around progressive ideals. That being said, would it be worth considering having several instructors on a campus as ""school marshalls""? These would be highly vetted instructors who would undergo stringent training to both organize effective defensive strategies for students (evacuation, concealment, barriers, etc) and defend with force if necessary, they'd also need to be trained to be first responders and stabilize any victims of an incident. They would be anonymous to all but each other, school police, and whatever other oversight the bureaucracy deems necessary. They would also need extensive psychological preparation for the potential of dealing with a child assailant(s), as it is too often the case with school shootings.

Really ONLY the military should have those, not even our police forces should. We have to be smart and practical about this issues. There is plenty of evidence from countries all over the world that we can pull from where they have made changes to gun laws. Reason should be our guiding light on this issue, not knee-jerk reactions and definitely not far-right extremism.

However, I live in a deep red state where most people are of the opinion that if everyone carried a gun with them at all times that there would be no crime. Any time anyone tries to mention any sort of gun control, Fox News starts banging their war drum that big gub'ment is coming to take your guns and enslave you, and I hear for weeks how important it is that everyone has a gun, because the constitution says so. This is what bothers me. 

In the European countries that I am familiar with (I can't claim to know them all or just say ""Europe""), guns are not banned. However, they are very expensive and it takes a long time to get them. From all the Europeans I have met (Brits, Germans, Finns, and Spaniards), nobody has the cowboy mindset that more guns=more safety that so many people in the U.S. have. I think the 2nd Amendment was important in 1791, but today it is simply not relevant. No matter how many guns you have in your basement, if the U.S. Army was sent to your neighborhood during a revolt, you would lose. hard. The world has changed. 

In that time, if everyone in a town had a couple of guns they could keep Redcoats or Indians or secessionist groups away from their farms or towns or what not. That was before the government could cut off electricity and water, or fire a missile from 20 miles away. What was originally written to protect people from tyranny is simply obsolete. Anymore it has become a tool that powerful lobbies use to scare people get rich, which has the side effect of increasing the number of guns in the country, which increases the chance of some whacko coming into possession of one, legally or illegally.

Would having less guns have necessarily prevented Sandy Hook, Aurora, Columbine, or the countless other massacres in recent years? No. Can a determined madman with nothing to lose still come into possession of high-powered firearms, even if they are banned? It is possible. However, we have to think not just of the large-scale tragedies, but also of the amount of crimes that happen every day that are not on the 24-hour news for a week at a time. The U.S. still has a high rate of gun violence, and I have a hard time believing that it is because we have too few guns in circulation.

In my opinion, the solution to this problem is not simply to ban guns and hope they go away, but to actively try to reduce the number in circulation. I don't see anything wrong with nationwide buybacks, destruction of all firearms seized in crimes, and a huge tax on new ones. I realize that this is wildly unpopular in many circles, and I respect people's right to disagree. However, I'm just so fed up with people hiding behind the constitution as if it was given directly by God himself instead of having meaningful discussion on how to solve what is obviously a very serious problem in this country.",I ve gotten a lot of hate for this comment  so let me clarify  I m not saying we should ban all guns  However  I live in a deep red state where,14.0,smp501 14,IvegottenalotofhateforthiscommentsoletmeclarifyImnotsayingweshouldbanallgunsHoweverIliveinadeepredstatewhere,2059.842,2084.32

They? Gun right advocates are not always conservative for starters.
Republicans did not exist yet neither did federalist or anti-federalist, nor the NRA. If you mean gun owners I think we can all say that most everyone who could own a gun was for gun rights.

&gt;Where were the rightwing gun owners when our government uprooted the Cherokee or the Sioux and treaties were trampled on? Did they help battle the KKK in the aftermath of the Civil War when ex-slaves and their allies were fighting for the lives and freedom? Did they ever rescue anyone in the wave of lynchings that spread racist terror across the American South?

I don't know, where were the left wing gun owners? I think these examples are perfect examples of how having access to guns, (2nd amendment), would have been prudent. For the oppressed in these cases their rights were violated, self defense would have been the only way to save themselves. The second amendment was created for just such cases; as we all know access to guns for these groups was limited or denied.

&gt;Did they stand up against company gun thugs during union organizing campaigns? Where were they when Bull Conner was putting police dogs on school children and the KKK was bombing churches and murdering civil rights workers. Have they ever offered to defend our nation's natural environment from corporate polluters?

Yes, gun owners did. One of the biggest examples of that was [West Virginia's Mine War](http://www.wvculture.org/history/minewars.html)

&gt;In America's fight against both government and private sector tyranny, rightwing gun owners have been part of the problem, not part of the solution. 

Seems like a matter of opinion.

&gt; In fact, rightwing gun owners have been among those who inflict armed violence to defend racial and class privilege. If they show up at all in America's freedom struggles, it's to fight on the wrong side.

In Vietnam, North Vietnam wasn't shooting down American B-52s with ""guns"" -- they used advanced anti-aircraft missiles. North Vietnam used large amounts of Chinese and Soviet weaponry, not just ""guns"".

In Iraq, the Iraqis flat out lost the combat portion of the war. The US used divide and conquer strategies and hard cash to successfully play Shiites against Sunnis to win the guerrilla portion of the war. The US eventually lost the war by a general revulsion of the entire Iraq occupation but mostly by skillful Iraqi political maneuvering which caused the US to have to follow its word of withdrawing US troops from Iraq (even though Obama tried hard to keep troops there).

In Afghanistan, the US and its Arab vassal states supplied the 1980s resistance with all sorts of weapons including anti-aircraft missiles.

My feeling is that you miss the key point. Sure, outside military help with a foreign power supplying cash and weapons will tip the balance -- hell, that's how the US won its independence from Britian (a tip of the hat to the French).

Here's the deal, the reason that the military still uses the M-16 after 50 years, and the reason the AR is more popular now than ever is that it is simply one of the best all around rifles ever designed. Because it's so modular it can be built to do any number of things. They are really accurate for the price point. The round they shoot, the .223 or 5.56mm is small enough that it doesn't produce much recoil, but is large enough to use on almost all game in the lower 48. Also because of the economy of scale the round is much much cheaper to buy than most other centerfire cartridges.

&gt; Funny how America excels at winning every battle, yet losing the war, eh?

Where the US loses is where a semi-united population of a country stands up and resists. Those populations usually have outside support, but the key is the resistance of the entire population.

I'll again say, I don't think the key is having guns. As we saw in Iraq, many guns there did not mean their insurgency won -- the insurgency lost, and the US lost by being outmaneuvered politically.

But there is a huge difference between the people of a country fighting against a foreign imperial invader, and the people of a country fighting to overthrow their own gov't.

We also do not see guerrilla wars in wealthy/advanced countries. (One of the few possible exceptions is Northern Ireland, where the insurgency lost.) Guerrilla wars are only seen in relatively poor countries.

Thus -- getting back to the main point -- all the guns in the world is not going to stop the US gov't's tyranny or violations of the Constitution or Bill of Rights. The US gov't currently violations its own laws and the Bill of Rights in numerous ways, but other than rare acts of rebellion, such as [Joe Stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Stack), the American people do not object and the 2nd Amendment does nothing to preserve the people's freedoms.

The only problem is, it supports a lot of the heart of what the gun rights people feel. It seems that many of our founding fathers were the same as our present day corporate, rich, elite leaders. They wanted the masses to be pacified, to shut up and pay their taxes and let them run things.

They may have made the 2nd Amendment to create a force that could put down a revolt but they left the wording too open to interpretation. So now the gun rights people use the 2nd Amendment to support their belief that the people should be able to defend themselves from a government that would oppress them. And this makes sense to a LOT of people that believe that the government isn't there to help the little guy but to protect the wealthy and powerful. And the gun manufacturers use the 2nd Amendment to support their ""right"" to make and sell as many guns as they can, without any restrictions.

We need to throw out the past, it's just plain crazy to think that anyone, no matter what kind of genius they are, could write a list of rules that would still apply to a world over 2 centuries in the future. The only reason people treat the Constitution as if it were the Bible is because they want to use it to justify what they believe in.

What Congress and the people should realize is that the 2nd Amendment states that a group of white men should be allowed to gather together and use muskets to protect their community. Everything else is just retroactive bullshit. With that in mind they should make laws that prevent the ownership of military styled weapons that have only one purpose, to efficiently kill more that a couple of people at a time. Our founding father could not have any concept of a hand held weapon that could kill dozens of people in just a few minutes. I imagine that if someone described such a weapon to them they would either call you insane or consider it the work of the devil.

So make laws that limit military styled weapons, extended ammo clips, ""cop killer"" bullets and the ability to buy guns without a background check. And if it's so wrong than our Supreme Court, in their infinite wisdom will overturn the law and, oh wait . . .

I don't think there's any debate anywhere about the legality of murder.  What the framers had in mind is not ambiguous unless you're trying to force your view on it though.  They intended the populace to be armed in case it's government should ever need overthrowing.

In the 1700's the British attempted to clamp down control of the American colonies by restricting access to weapons. Had they been successful they would have been able to control the territory and exploit the resources as well as tax the people living in the colonies like crazy. By having the means to defend themselves from an oppressive government, the colonists secured their freedoms. 

One of the first key events leading to the American Revolution was an attempt by the British to seize American weapons. This was at a time when most people ate what they grew or hunted, so taking their means of getting food was a major concern. Even today many Americans will hunt animals to curb population explosions and subsequent starvation/explosion of predators. Also Americans still hunt as a means of feeding their families. 

Another example is an apocryphal quote as to why the Japanese refused to invade mainland America, and it was that there would be ""a rifle behind every blade of grass."" In similar fashion, Hitler avoided waging war with Switzerland for similar reasons, not only is Switzerland geographically unassailable, a large portion of the population owns a ""military"" style rifle. In short, no one wants to fuck with a country where the citizens has a means of fighting.

So why have an AR-15? Because if someone decides to invade your home/country, you're going to want to repel their attacks. If the citizens do not have a means of protecting themselves, well, we've seen what happens throughout history. Some cuppycake idealism about peace being possible is naive and frankly destructive.

I live in a neighborhood with a relatively high crime rate. Would-be criminals probably don't have legally-obtained guns. Imposing further restrictions won't take the guns from their hands.

If you've lived in the suburbs your whole life, you connect guns with the mass shootings that predominantly affect other suburbanites. But those are extremely rare. Most shootings are the result of gang activity.

2414,697,cceoy6n,Willravel,progressive,Washington Navy Yard shooting,1380057297,"&gt;What troubles me with this stuff is that we don't really care all that much about gun crime, over the decades, until spree-shootings happen, or gang-violence blooms, and then the discussion comes up about how to address those horrendous issues.

I do. I care about all crime. I care specifically about gun crime because I see how much more of it we have in the US relative to the rest of the developed world, and I'd like for that not to be the case whether there's a mass shooting this week (there are mass shootings almost every week) or not. There's no reason for the gun homicide rate to be so high. There's no reason for the gun suicide rate to be so high. There's no reason that our statistics should be different than Germany or Canada or the UK or Spain or Italy or Japan or China or Australia. [And yet they are, significantly.](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-states)

The x-factor, near as I can tell, is that we have a powerful gun lobby. In 1996, after a terrible mass shooting, Australia gave gun control a shot and it worked. It really worked, in fact, with a drop-off of [firearm homicides by 59% and firearm suicides of 65%](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/08/02/did-gun-control-work-in-australia/). And, much to everyone's shock, there was no correlated or parallel increase in non-firearm homicides or suicides. We've tried passing similar laws here in the US, but they end up with holes in them because our political systems allow for those with money to dictate what goes into or doesn't go into legislation, which is why we so often get nonsensical gun control like banning one gun but allowing another gun which is almost identical. 

&gt;But background checks do next to nothing to address those specific issues. Gangs are a criminal culture with black market connections, so it won't make a dent...or a trivial dent at best.

The #1 source of guns used in crimes in the US are straw purchases, where someone has someone buy a gun for them. This is so prevalent in part because the NRA has lobbied to reduce punishment for those found guilty of straw purchasing. Did you know the NRA openly opposes making straw purchases a crime? And studies and operations have been done that discovered that [a full 25% of gun dealers](http://www.salon.com/2012/07/23/nra_a_lobby_for_criminals/) are willing to sell to people who openly admit during the purchase that they're straw purchasing. At gun shows, btw, that number balloons to 94%. 

The problem isn't so much that background checks don't work, it's that the industry is actively sabotaging background checks, and the gun lobby is preventing law enforcement from cracking down on them. They're sabotaging the system, then they're complaining that the system doesn't work. As a progressive, you should be all too familiar with this strategy, as it's one of the most used tools of the American right. 

Personally, I don't care at all about guns. They're just tools. The issue I have is that when they're in the wrong hands, they're the most efficient tool which is readily available to kill as many people as possible with little effort and which has a massive lobby that cares more about making sure everyone is buying guns than actually representing our Second Amendment right to bear arms. Guns aren't the problem, but the gun lobby and gun industry most certainly are. 

Have you been to Australia since 1996? Ask a staunch conservative gun enthusiast if the law passed in 1996 was opportunistically exploiting a tragedy, or was actually preventing future tragedies. Go ahead.

Note, the offending quote can actually be interpreted in a way that means a lynch mob didn't occur, but that the goal of the uproar was to try to create a metaphorical lynching. Probably not what the guy intended though, but something to keep in mind, the author could be taking a leap of faith here.

Author mentioned plenty of actual cases where white men used the term to describe what they were going through, but, technically speaking, it didn't mean those people were referencing that they were victims of a racist-based ""lynch mob"". It's still a tremendously dumb thing to compare one's trivialities with though. 

Lynch mobs have a long history that are not always racist in nature. Suspected/accused/convicted murders, rapists, child abusers, witches, spies, etc... can be lynched, and race may have had nothing to do with it.

The guy could have picked a less colorful metaphor to describe their so-called victimization, but for this author to on a long rant about white guys who use the term just as freely as any other demographic is pretty pathetic. Just because the US has a shitty racist history with respect to lynch mobs doesn't mean it cannot be used by white guys in a hyperbole...

I give no support to the NRA in any form, but I do take time to vote every year, choosing the most moderate people.

The NRA is almost immune from exterior pressures; but by working inside the organization we can affect much needed changes.

&gt; If he were to unholster and start shooting, and the principal had not called for a lockdown it would have been his ass.

By far one of the weakest arguments to make. If the damn gun was concealed he could have done that anyway. The only issue here is that the gun being visible makes people uncomfortable and disabuse of them the notion that people can just bring guns on their person.

Yes, I get it. Many bad decisions are made under the principal of cover your ass.

This is just a thought ending cliche. The disproportionate behavior of others is not the basis for curtailing others peoples rights. That goes into hecklers vetoe territory. There is nothing wrong with open carrying. The only thing ""wrong"" about it is how other people respond irrationally to it.

then someone comes into the scene with a gun and starts shooting. that person you were standing next to and blaming for being in your way and walking too slow is now laying at your feet, bleeding, looking up at you in horror, and dying. while you're trying to grasp that scene, you look around and there are people around you falling to the ground landing motionless or writhing in pain. the shooter is still shooting and you are frozen because you have no idea what the hell to make of all this.

THAT is why the ""good guy with a gun"" theory is bullshit. surreality. the inability of your brain to cope with the sudden and inexplicable scene unfolding before you.

this is why cops and soldiers go through all that training. not only do they have to be able to overcome the surreality of the moment, but they have to actually react without thinking...because their thinking has been short-circuited (for the time being) by the scene. muscle memory takes over in the time it takes to get their bearings.

just because you have a gun in your purse or in a holster under your coat doesn't mean you'll be able to overcome the brain's inability to shift from one way of thinking to another in enough time to draw your weapon, take aim (calmly) and shoot the shooter. the shooter has the upperhand and with the element of surprise will be able to outdraw you if you hesitate even for a second.

now imagine that you've finally gathered your wits about you enough to find your weapon, take the safety off, wade through the dead bodies of people (you might even know a few) and try to get in some shots. the shooter is still shooting...you have to act fast...so you take shots too soon. now you're just firing in his general direction...all of your missed shots are passing by him and are endangering the people on the other side. you don't even see that because you're so focused on shooting the shooter...who now knows your location.

let's say there are two ""good guys with guns"" but the other guy is on the other side of the shooter from you. now you've got two shooters shooting in your direction. people are dead on the floor, you're taking on friendly fire, fire alarms are blaring, people are screaming, running, falling...

a real life scenario (involving no good guys with guns) that illustrates the point.

a local restaurant was held up close to where i live a couple of years ago. two young gunmen entered the restaurant at 11:30pm. the place is known for its designer drinks, so just about everyone in the place had been drinking. the law in my state do allow for concealed carry in places that sell alcohol. 

the layout is open so when you come into the restaurant you can see the entire dining area. there is an elevated area to the right that is behind a half wall and that elevated area runs front to back. the room is about 1000 sq ft, i would say.

so these young guys come in, by most accounts they are jittery and waving their rifles around. they go around a take everyone's wallet.

no one in the restaurant pulled a gun (if they had one) and no shots were fired. pretty disturbing though and it all happened in a few minutes' time.

but imagine if you're a patron. you're sitting there enjoying that second bourbon and in walks these guys. you have know idea whether they'll start shooting or if they're really just after the money. at what point do you try to nonchalantly pull out your weapon? and if you do, do you start a gunfight with two guys in a restaurant where people have been drinking and there is no place to hide?

luckily, no shots were fired. but being in a position of a little bit of haze from the alcohol, then trying to assess the situation in a way that is appropriate, then trying to decide IF you're going to use your weapon, then, if so, WHEN are you going to pull it out?

i don't know if anyone had a gun that night...and if they did, they showed great restraint in not using it. but it illustrates the point that these situations are volatile, fluid, and incredibly complex. in the heat of the moment (and in this case, add some alcohol into the mix) and things could get nasty in a hurry.",there s no way to know  of course   unless the shooters are dressed in ways that set them apart  masks  multiple weapons slung over their back  etc    but in the heat of the,22.0,thefunivehad 22,theresnowaytoknowofcourseunlesstheshootersaredressedinwaysthatsetthemapartmasksmultipleweaponsslungovertheirbacketcbutintheheatofthe,1760.392,3140.352

For a citizen of the US, [the real risks of terrorism](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/01/the_comparative.html) or even violent crime are negligible. If you want to be concerned about something likely to kill you, at the very least ensure that you have a storm shelter. A tornado is far more likely to kill you than a terrorist. Hell, so is lightning - so make sure your home is equipped with a lightning rod. And both are pretty diffuse risks compared to getting in your car. 

It's easy to say ""a good guy with a gun"" is the only thing that stops ""a bad guy with a gun.""

Trouble is, the bad guy with the gun made a point of looking like a good guy until he pulled their weapon out of concealment. Where's your magical Good Guy halo when you need it - the one that will tell the Good Girl with a Table Leg not to brain you from behind? You have a gun. She's close enough to kill you if she acts right now and doesn't stop to think real hard. She's terrified and has enough adrenaline to lift a car. And you just gave all that terror a focus. 

I keep running into this; I keep asking the question; I never get a proper answer. What is it about you that should communicate to other people that you are fundamentally different and more trustworthy than anyone else who happens to have a gun shoved into their belt? Even if they aren't scared out of their minds, with bullets whizzing by, why should they rationally assume you are a Good Guy, that guy is ""a likely terrorist"" and that other one over there is ""an urban thug?""

My, that sounds racist. And it is. But we are talking about a situation where visceral threat-assessments are the only ones that are likely to happen. What I'm saying here is that it's very unlikely that you could draw your weapon in such a situation without terrifying other people. I'm not going to even deal with whether or not you could deal with an active shooter. I think the video shows the challenges. 

You need some way for the good guys to tell you from the bad guys. Or you ARE a bad guy. 

A cel phone and a spare battery are far more likely to be the life-saving edge in almost every real-world situation than a handgun and a spare mag, even counting terrorist situations. Seriously. 

Even if taking a snapshot is the last thing you ever do - you just gave a good guy with a good guy uniform the information they need to shoot the right person.

The point is that in a confused situation, there IS no good guy with a gun. There is no way to tell if the person with a gun is good. Therefore, the rational thing to do, in an active shooter situation is to assume that anyone with a gun is an active shooter.

There's a reason why soldiers wear uniforms, even though it identifies them as legitimate targets, it also shows who is NOT a legitimate target. That's also the reason why a civilian holding a weapon will tend to be shot out of hand; under the laws of war, belligerents are not allowed to act while in civilian garb. They may be summarily executed. Why is this? It's because otherwise, it's too tempting as a tactic.

2556,926,cxy6ndd,FaustTheBird,progressive,San Bernardino attack,1450058668,"So your entire point is that having a gun identifies you to everyone that can see you with a gun as a potential bad guy so therefore it makes no sense to have a gun without a uniform or other identifying characteristic. For example, it's not enough to have a hand gun in a movie theater pointed in the direction of a man with a rifle that is actively shooting. The ""good guy"" also needs some kind of blinking vest or safety stripes.

And your reasoning for this boils down to ""if you pull a gun out, someone might try to hurt you"". All of your examples seem to be other victims. If this is the case, I guess anyone pulling a gun in self-defense is just going to have to deal with possibly getting attacked by some other victim, although, probably not someone else with gun because it'd be previous obvious to both handgun wielding CCs that the threat is the guy with the rifle gunning down anything that's moving. So we've narrowed it down to, if you pull out a gun, you might get hurt. Considering the fact that the reason for drawing the gun was in fact being in danger of losing one's life, I can only speak in the abstract here, but that's probably a risk most CCs would be willing to take.

But still, the absurdity is striking here. Why wouldn't the active shooter who is terrorizing a movie theater be under that same threat? If it's such a meaningful threat that you're willing to write 12 paragraphs about it, wouldn't the active shooter be really under threat from that projector operator with a table leg? You might argue that the handgun CC is less threatening and therefore a more likely target, but then doesn't that demolish your point about the confusion being so great that victims can't tell the difference between the real threat and someone less threatening?

And still, the real kicker is that you state that the RIGHT thing to do in a situation with a gunman firing at civilians is to attack a gunman! But I guess ""without a gun"" is implied in your statement? It just seems so strange. Imagine the Monty Python routine for this dialog:

John Cleese: ""The situation is perilous and confused.""  
Michael Palin: ""Right, I'll go do the right thing that must be done. I will render the gunman harmless.""  
Cleese: ""Good man.... WAIT!""  
Palin: ""What?""  
Cleese: ""Don't go out there with that!""  
Palin: ""With what?""  
Cleese: ""That... that gun!""  
Palin: ""What?! How else am I going to render him harmless?""  
Cleese (grabbing a fireplace shovel): ""Here. Use this.""  
Palin: ""Why? I've got a perfectly good gun here, he's got a gun and he's actually shooting at people. I wouldn't stand a chance with that shovel!""  
Cleese: ""Sure, sure, but you wouldn't want anyone else thinking that you were the bad guy!""  
Palin: ""What? Are the police here?""  
Cleese: ""No. But. Say someone has a shovel....""

A reading of the Bill of Rights is best done in historical context.

The American colonies had just emerged from a war with England, in which *well regulated militias* represented a substantial reason for the American victory.

If you'll look, Amendment 3 also speaks to the historical context of the Bill of Rights, prohibiting the quartering of troops in private homes during peacetime and severely restricting the practice in times of war. This is something the British did routinely.

So let's dispense with the notion that the Bill of Rights was some kind of prescient, all-encompassing document that rings down through the ages without need for updating and modification. Every one of the rights enumerated in the BoR is there because the British had been actively abridging those things for the colonists.

Free speech, public assembly, ownership of firearms, quartering troops in homes, searching / seizing colonists' property... 

It's very likely that the men who drafted the Bill of Rights might have a very different take on a number of the rights enumerated in it if they were alive today.

If you want to argue that the Bill of Rights didn't include flights on commercial air liners (i.e., the right to travel freely) and therefore that free movement within a country's boundaries is not a civil right, then you don't get to look at an amendment that is *specifically* phrased to refer to ownership of arms in concert with their use within an organized volunteer military organizations  and just extend to any restriction on any firearm.

CAN BE is a weasel phrase. For the most part, they are no different than any semi-auto hunting rifle. 

And truth, [according to the FBI,](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2009-2013.xls) is that for every one person murdered with a rifle or shotgun, nearly ten were murdered with a handgun. 

Yet it's always 'assault' rifles that need to be banned. 

It's one of two things: either it's a knee-jerk reaction (which is bad) or it's racist because most murders are in inner cities where black people kill other black people with handguns, so who cares. 

&gt;changing the receiver to convert to auto

And this happens so infrequently as to be statistically irrelevant. When was the last time somebody rolled up to a mass killing with a full auto rifle or other firearm? I can't think of  a single one. The bank robbery in North Hollywood maybe?

Yet every mass shooting has a pistol, and rarely do you hear about wanting to ban pistols. Cause that's 100% a non-starter.

It's a fact. They can be. And one of the recent mass shootings used a modded-to-auto AR-15 (see below). You can't turn a bolt-action hunting rifle into a full auto. Whether or not many people are capable of converting over an AR-15, the fact is that it *can be* done. And *is* being done.

&gt;And you, like other progressives I've had this conversation say things like ""An AR-15 is different from a bolt-action rifle or a shotgun"" yet don't seem to have a real explanation as to what makes it different.

It seems like the real difference is how intimidating it looks.

Nonsense, I explained exactly why it's different. It's literally the same gun as the M16, and can be upgraded to essentially identical specs, including full auto. And there are numerous online forums with people discussing how the guns can be modified to be closer to auto (trigger mods, for example) without actually swapping out the receiver. So don't pretend that the AR-15 is the same as your lever action .30-06 or 12-gauge. It's not. And it has nothing to do with it ""looking scary.""

But okay, you want to talk about regulating handguns, fine! Let's talk about that. They're definitely more of a problem than rifles / long guns, and are involved in more shootings.

But in terms of *mass shootings* it's notable that it's the AR-15 that has been featured most recently: in Aurora, at Sandy Hook, in San Bernadino (where both shooters used AR-15s, and one was modded to auto), and now in Orlando.

For me, a major problem I have is the notion that purchasing a weapon like what routinely gets called (correctly or incorrectly) an assault rifle, or an 'AR-15', is somehow a ""basic freedom"".

I don't want to ban all guns (I live in the Midwest... lots of hunting &amp; gun enthusiasts), but I find it extremely hard to rationalize the legality of weapons that can inflict so much damage, &amp; seem clearly built for a true military battlefield.

To me, the basic freedom that shouldn't be trampled on is that of all people to be able to go to a club, or school, or a mall, etc. without having to worry about someone appearing with a weapon that can kill as many people in as short a time as an assault rifle.

I agree that there is a better way to try to solve these problems, &amp; that said better way is indeed harder.  But part of what makes it difficult IMO is the clinging to the notion that access to military-grade (or very close to it) weapons is somehow a basic right.  Handguns for sport, &amp; self defense?

So I respect that people don't want ineffective laws, but those same people seem to have already decided that no laws ever will be effective so we just shouldn't try.  The problem with the previous assault weapon ban is that it wasn't comprehensive.  I don't think it was particularly effective, but that's far more likely to be due to grandfathered in guns and readily available non-assault weapons than due to the innate foolishness of assault weapon bans.

I had a close friend who was involved in the pro-gun crowd for several years.  I met more than a few people who were opposed to what many people think of as ""common sense"" gun control laws, such as background checks at trade shows and from private vendors.  I knew several people who are happy to talk about the ways they got around gun registration for the purpose of having unregistered guns just for fun (and in case they ever wanted to kill someone)--there's a whole subset of gun owners who take gun control laws as a personal challenge.  I actually wasn't strongly pro-gun control until I saw some of the ways these people responded to the Newtown shooting--wild allegations of conspiracy, claims that there was no number too high of child fatalities to make gun control necessary.  I think we're at a point where if pro-gun people, who have been the loudest voices on guns for the past few decades, don't start taking steps that they're comfortable with to make some changes, they're going to see steps that they're not.

Presumably there would be more of a structure around preventing people on the no fly list from purchasing weapons than exists now, and it's hard to say if that structure would or would not have made a difference in this specific instance, but it honestly doesn't matter.  It wouldn't have made a difference if Florida denied guns to people with a history of physical spousal abuse, either, because it doesn't look like the first wife reported it.

I digress, what truly keeps on the other nations from invading are oceans and two weaker countries to the North and South. Guns are only a minor part. The thing about guns is that there is no other reason for them to be in existence except to kill. Cars transport people, opiates relieve pain, Etc. 

The Second Amendment is not in the Constitution to protect people or keep them from becoming slaves. Not let Federal power dominate over an individual states. Obviously, the citizens of this country prefer a federal government no matter what they say because of their actions. Hence the increase of fed power since the 30s. So the whole argument behind the Second Amendment it's really kind of bullshit. I'd even take the argument for people being militias before I would take the bullshit argument of a person protecting themselves. That's really only been around since the Heller decision.

The whole point behind gun control is not to prevent every death. Just like driving a car or taking pills, sometimes shit happens. The point behind it is to limit access because inherently, more guns that are out there the more problems and deaths will be caused because of them. I will give you an example. Why do you think the successful suicide rate is much higher with men than women? It's because men have guns at easy accessible times in larger numbers. People will still jump off buildings to take pills but when an easy situation presents itself EG shooting yourself, people will take that row. Same goes for people who want to do crazy shit and kill a bunch of people. Trucks are available Plaines that are available and everything else but easiest thing one can plan for in this country is to buy a gun and on their own fruition practice in order to be sure that they kill people easily.

WASHINGTON — The National Rifle Association is opposing a ban on “Zyklon B” like the chemical used by Germans to turn fairly tame detention centers in to death camps, stressing its support for more limited regulations.

The powerful lobby last week surprised many chemical-based human  extermination control advocates by embracing possible restrictions on the Zyklon B in the wake of  millions of people exterminated before and during World War 2, prompting bipartisan support in Congress for regulating or banning Zyklon B.

But on Sunday, the NRA drew a line on an outright ban.

Chris Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist, said too much public focus was being placed on limiting Zyklon B rather than preventing bad human behavior. He said it was the responsibility of the U.S. Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — not Congress — to regulate the sale of Zyklon B.

B: None of those things you mention are needed if I keep my car on private property. How about I just keep my firearm on my private property? That means I won’t have to have any of those things, right?

C: It’s MUCH harder to buy a gun than buy a car, particularly if your history includes criminal behavior. For a car, both new and used, in both cases you write a check and sign a title. There is less paperwork in buying a car than purchasing a gun! When buying the car, you don’t have to have two forms of government issued ID (depending on the state), have to fill out a “car transference form,” sometimes need a pre-existing Firearms Owners Card, and undergo a background check. This in spite of the fact that owning a gun is a Constitutional right and a car is not!

D: So, about registering cars, those registries have been misused on occasion. Government registries have a rather disturbing history of being used against their citizens. For example, at least 74 law enforcers were suspected of misusing the D.A.V.I.D. car registration in Florida in 2012, a nearly 400 percent increase from 2011, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Officers were pulling down photographs and private information of people, sometimes for purposes of revenge.

E:  
You are not required to register and tag a vehicle at the point of purchase. You could back up a flatbed to the dealership and drive off with it that way. (Unlike guns which need in some states to be registered, and all need serial numbers.)

Lots of states don't require actual drivers education. (Unlike states where you need to pass a course to get a firearm owner’s card.)
I'm not required to inspect or insure a car that I operate on private pieces of land. I'm not even required to get my car inspected before use on public roads in 48 states.
Felons can own cars.
There are incredibly few restrictions on car designs and models.
There are practically no limits on what I can do to modify my car, at least compared to firearms.
There is no waiting period or background check for buying a car.
Cars can be freely bought and sold by almost anyone any time.
Most of that actually doesn't sound too bad. It would certainly make owning a gun easier if guns were more like cars.

Even though white males are underrepresented in [committing mass shootings](https://www.statista.com/statistics/476456/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-shooter-s-race/), the real problem with mass shootings is white males and them feeling entitled.

""The United States Postal Service (USPS) won’t mail handguns except under certain rare circumstances, mostly for relic collection and museum purposes, meaning almost all handgun shipments need to go through either the United Parcel Service (UPS) or FedEx.

UPS requires all handguns be shipped overnight, according to their website.

FedEx’s public policy, like UPS’s, is that “firearms must be shipped via FedEx Priority Overnight service,” according to the company’s 2018 Service Guide, which also states that FedEx will not transport handguns via FedEx Ground.

But FedEx does not apply its public rules to everyone. According to the document, the company has struck a deal with dozens of major gun manufacturers and dealers in an effort to woo the industry away from competitors with lower cost shipping. The agreement, which has not been previously reported, shows how important the handgun shipment business is to FedEx.


“Some customers have been approved for an exception to ship firearms with a 2-day (AM or PM) service,” the document says. Those customers include 86 firearms manufacturers and dealers, including nearly every major company in the business, like Smith &amp; Wesson, Colt, Glock, SIG Sauer, and the NRA itself.""

The NRA, GOP and other right wing groups always play offense.  Even when you'd think they'd shut the fuck up and chill out for a few weeks when there is a fresh new school shooting, instead they are out there attacking everyone and coming up with idiotic ""solutions"" like arming teachers or blaming everyone but themselves.  

The Left?  Where the fuck are they?  The students in FL accomplished more in a few weeks than all the progressive (and moderate) million dollar organizations have been able to accomplish in decades.  Even the fact that public opinion is ever so slightly swaying (finally) against the NRA and toward more sane gun laws is because of these kids, not because of the perpetually disorganized Left.  

Why isn't the Left pointing out that these latest tragedies have happened in the most gun friendly states?  Why hasn't the Left linked those two facts together; easy access to guns = more opportunities for shootings? Why hasn't the Left made a huge stink about the fact that there were cops in these schools and even though they were *armed*, kids still got shot?
