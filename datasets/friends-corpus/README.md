# Character Mining

The Character Mining project challenges machine comprehension on multiparty dialogue.
The objective of this project is to infer explicit and implicit contexts about individual characters through their conversations.
This is an open-source project led by the [Emory NLP](http://nlp.mathcs.emory.edu) research group that provides resources for the following tasks:

* [Character Identification](../../../character-identification) (since May 2016).
* [Emotion Detection](../../../emotion-detection) (since May 2017).
* [Reading Comprehension](../../../reading-comprehension) (since May 2018).
* [Questiong Answering](../../../question-answering) (since May 2019).

We welcome feedbacks and contributions from the community.
Most of our annotation are crowdsourced; implying that, errors are expected to be found.
Please make pull requests if you wish to fix errors in our datasets.

## Dataset

Our dataset is based on the popular TV show called [*Friends*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends).
Transcripts for all 10 seasons of the show as well as manual and crowdsourced annotation for subparts of the show are provided.
All text data are available in the [JSON files](json); please visit the individual task pages to retrieve datasets specifically designed for those tasks.

## Statistics

Each season consists of episodes, each episode is divided into scenes, each scene comprises utterances, each utterance is a list of sentences where tokens are split.

| Season ID | Episodes | Scenes | Utterances | Sentences |  Tokens | Speakers |
|:---------:|---------:|-------:|-----------:|----------:|--------:|---------:|
|    s01    |       24 |    326 |      5,968 |    10,790 |  81,453 |      107 |

|    s03    |       25 |    348 |      6,495 |    10,858 |  90,753 |      108 |
|    s04    |       24 |    338 |      6,318 |    10,889 |  87,289 |      100 |

|    s07    |       24 |    332 |      6,314 |    11,340 |  84,974 |       94 |
|    s08    |       24 |    288 |      6,220 |    11,714 |  86,164 |      107 |
|    s09    |       24 |    302 |      6,322 |    11,831 |  93,773 |       99 |
|    s10    |       18 |    219 |      5,247 |     9,345 |  69,493 |       78 |
|   Total   |      236 |  3,107 |     61,309 |   108,733 | 850,100 |      700 |

Some utterances include action notes.
In the following example, extracted from `s01_e01_c01_u028`, the speaker is talking *to Ross*, which is indicated by the action note:

```
"transcript": "Let me get you some coffee.",
"transcript_with_note": "(to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.",
```

The followings show the statistics including action notes:

| Season ID | Utterances | Sentences |    Tokens |
|:---------:|-----------:|----------:|----------:|
|    s01    |      6,626 |    12,088 |   100,773 |
|    s02    |      6,048 |    10,565 |    97,763 |
|    s03    |      7,267 |    12,288 |   117,912 |
|    s04    |      7,119 |    12,811 |   116,703 |
