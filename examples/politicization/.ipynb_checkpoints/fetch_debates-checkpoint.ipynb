The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, \\nHealth and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies will \\ncome to order.\\n    I am certainly pleased we could have this opportunity this \\nmorning, Dr. Collins, to talk to you and the other Institute \\ndirectors about the work you are doing and the work you would \\nlike to do.\\n    Every family faces health concerns during their lifetime, \\nand there are so many things that can be done by NIH that I \\nthink can't be done as well anywhere else. A new drug, a new \\ndevice, a new treatment, can take anywhere from a decade to \\nlonger to develop. It can cost billions of dollars on occasion, \\nwith a pretty high failure rate even when you think you are on \\nthe right path.\\n    Certainly, it is necessary for the Federal Government to \\ninvest in biomedical research. It represents the hopes of lots \\nof people and lots of families, and particularly now as we see \\nconditions growing as people survive heart problems and stroke \\nproblems. We see more people with Alzheimer's and cancer \\nchallenges. We see the potential for designer medicine largely \\nbecause of the great work that was done to figure out how to \\ndefine and understand the human genome system in a better way.\\n    This year, this subcommittee and the full Committee have \\nplaced a high priority on this research. We have planned for \\nand have a bill that includes $2 billion of extra money for \\nthat research, an increase of about 7 percent over the current \\nyear's spending.\\n    Over the past decade, with not much new money going into \\nNIH, the purchasing power at NIH has decreased by about 22 \\npercent. We hope to see that reversed, if we are successful \\nwith what we are trying to do to provide the increase that we \\nare looking at here.\\n    These are clearly difficult budgetary times, and I am sure \\nwe could spend a lot of this hearing talking about how there \\nshould be more money for other things in this budget, and there \\nis a disagreement on that in some cases and an agreement in \\nsome cases, that if we had all the money in the world, the \\npriorities might be a whole lot easier to achieve.\\n    But I will look forward to hearing from you, Dr. Collins, \\nand from the team that you have brought. As we talked about \\nthis morning, I specifically said, can you bring some of the \\nInstitute Directors that we haven't seen lately who are very \\nmuch focused on the individual areas of research, so we can get \\na greater sense of understanding what the potential is, what \\nthe needs are, what is out there that you are seeing and \\nbeginning to see?\\n    Also I'd like to discuss the challenge with young \\nresearchers having a research grant approved. They are \\ndramatically less than they were a decade ago, and I am sure \\nthat that is a topic that we will want to discuss as well. How \\nlong do young researchers stay in research, if they continue to \\nhave their ideas--not allowed to move forward?\\n    So those are all the things we want to talk about today. We \\nare glad you are here. I want to turn to Senator Murray, who is \\na big supporter of your work as well for her opening statement.\\n    [The statement follows:]\\n                Prepared Statement of Senator Roy Blunt\\n    The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health & Human Services, \\nEducation, and Related Agencies will come to order.\\n    I'm certainly pleased we could have this opportunity this morning, \\nDr. Collins, to talk to you and the other Institute Directors about the \\nwork you're doing and the work you'd like to do.\\n    Certainly every family faces health concerns during their lifetime, \\nand there are so many things that can be done by NIH that I think can't \\nbe done as well anywhere else.\\n    A new drug, a new device, a new treatment, can take anywhere from a \\ndecade to longer to develop.

We're glad \\nyou're here. I want to turn to Senator Murray who is a big supporter of \\nyour work as well for her opening statement.\\n\\n                   STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATTY MURRAY\\n\\n    Senator Murray. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, \\nespecially for your focus on this. I think we all really \\nappreciate it.\\n    Dr. Collins, thank you for being here. I am grateful, as we \\nall are, for all you have done to champion the critical work \\nthat NIH does. You have been a great partner, and it is great \\nto see you here.\\n    And thank you to all of your team that is with us today. We \\nlook forward to hearing from all of you.\\n    All of us here today agree there is a lot more we need to \\ndo to keep our families and our communities healthy, and \\ncontinue investing in priorities that strengthen our economy \\nfrom the middle out. The work of the National Institutes of \\nHealth is vitally important to that effort. The NIH supports \\nbasic research that makes medical advances possible, gives \\nhopes to those living with chronic and life-threatening \\ndiseases, and helps drive economic growth and competitiveness.\\n    In my own home State of Washington, we have researchers who \\nare working on ways to repair heart tissue that has been \\ndamaged by disease and injury. We have people working on \\ndecoding difficult-to-treat forms of breast cancer. We use \\nprecision medicine to tackle eye disease and Alzheimer's. The \\nlist goes on.\\n    Those are just a few examples of the incredible work done \\nto improve health and well-being for families across the \\ncountry and really around the globe.\\n    At the same time, the life sciences are helping to drive \\neconomic growth and job creation. In my State, the life \\nsciences sector directly employs 34,000 people, making it the \\nfifth largest employment sector in my State.\\n    The investments that we make in NIH and education and other \\nprograms under this subcommittee's jurisdiction that support \\nthe life sciences indirectly will help our economy create the \\njobs of the 21st century and help ensure a workforce that can \\ntake them on.\\n    That is why, like Chairman Blunt, I see maintaining our \\ncountry's central role in the life sciences as a top priority, \\nand Federal investments in medical research could not be more \\nimportant to this effort. Supporting medical research starts \\nwith making sure shortsighted budgeting does not get in the \\nway. For far too long, we have seen inflation erode Federal \\ninvestments in R&D, making it harder for researchers to get the \\nsupport they need.\\n    In fact, I know that you, Dr. Collins, have said that, \\nincreasingly, the NIH is having to turn promising projects \\naway. For patients and families who are waiting and hoping for \\nmedical breakthroughs, that is unacceptable.\\n    I am very proud that in late 2013, Democrats and \\nRepublicans were able to reach a budget agreement to roll back \\nsequestration for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. As we all know, \\nthat deal expired last week, which means Congress is going to \\nonce again have to come together and find a solution.\\n    As I have made clear, I believe that we need an agreement \\nthat builds on the bipartisan foundation set in the budget deal \\nfrom last Congress, rolls back the cuts to defense and \\nnondefense investments equally, and protects priorities that \\nare essential to promoting a strong and growing middle class, \\nlike research and education and infrastructure.\\n    I have been encouraging my colleagues on the other side of \\nthe aisle to come to the table to work with us so that we can \\nreach another bipartisan budget deal and avoid those automatic \\ncuts that impact these and other important investments in our \\ncountry's future. I am also currently working with Chairman \\nAlexander, who is here today, on the HELP Committee on a \\nbipartisan initiative to advance medical innovation. That is an \\neffort that is very much related to the conversation today. I \\nsee that initiative as an opportunity to help patients get the \\nbest, most effective cures and treatments as quickly as \\npossible while upholding the highest standards of consumer and \\npatient safety.\\n    And to me, a central part of accomplishing this goal and \\ntackling the tough medical challenges our country faces is \\nmaking sure that research and development can thrive.\\n    I am pleased that so far we have seen bipartisan interest \\nin ramping up investments in the NIH and FDA, and I have made \\nclear that I will only support a bill that does just that. I am \\ngoing to be very focused on finding a path forward on this goal \\nin the coming weeks because, put simply, stronger investment in \\nmedical research mean a stronger, healthier country.\\n    So I am hopeful that Republicans and Democrats can come \\ntogether to build on the bipartisan foundation we set in the \\nbudget deal last Congress and make the investments we need to \\nseize these and other opportunities in a way that helps our \\neconomy and our country work better for our families.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Blunt. Thank you.\\n    Before I yield to Dr. Collins for his opening statement, I \\nhave received a statement from full committee vice chairman, \\nSenator Mikulski. Her statement will be inserted into the \\nrecord at this point.\\n    [The statement follows:]\\n           Prepared Statement of Senator Barbara A. Mikulski\\n    Thank you, Chairman Blunt and Ranking Member Murray for holding \\nthis important hearing today. I also want to thank our witnesses, Dr. \\nFrancis Collins, our brilliant and tireless NIH Director, as well as \\nall the NIH Institute Directors before us today, including Dr. Douglas \\nLowy, Acting Director of the National Cancer Institute who will likely \\none day receive a Nobel Prize for his work on the HPV vaccine.\\n    I am so pleased we're here today to talk about an issue very close \\nto my heart: the National Institutes of Health. I call it the National \\nInstitutes of Hope. When we invest in NIH, we see better cures and \\ntreatments for diseases and conditions that devastate families and \\ndrive up health costs, from Alzheimer's and autism to diabetes, heart \\ndisease, and cancer.\\n    The NIH is a world-class institution responsible for turning \\nscientific discoveries into better health for us all. Because of the \\nwork at NIH, we have cut the cancer death rate by 11 percent in women \\nand 19 percent in men. Deaths from heart attack and stroke have been \\nreduced by 70 percent in the past 60 years. A child born today will \\nlikely live to be 78 years old--nearly three decades longer than a baby \\nborn in 1900.\\n    That's just the start of NIH breakthroughs. In 2013 alone, NIH was \\na major source of support for eight of the 10 most highly touted \\nscientific discoveries of the year. Not a bad year's work! But I know \\nand I hope that more is to come.\\n    As Chair of the Appropriations Committee, I've been pleased to \\nsecure funding increases for NIH in recent years, including a $1 \\nbillion increase in fiscal year 2014 and a $200 million increase in \\nfiscal year 2015. But it's not enough. Over the past 10 years, NIH \\nfunding has not kept pace with inflation leading to a 20 percent \\nreduction in purchasing power for NIH. Adjusted for inflation, NIH \\nactually receives nearly 25 percent less funding today than it did in \\n2003.\\n    This is quite simply unacceptable. At a time when so many other \\ncountries are ramping up their investments in biomedical research, the \\nU.S. is scaling back. We must find a way to provide NIH with stable and \\nreliable funding increases in order to advance life-saving medical \\nresearch for patients worldwide.\\n    Lifting budget caps is the most appropriate solution. By doing so, \\nwe lift all boats. We cannot just life caps for defense spending. That \\ndoesn't help NIH. We must also lift caps for non-defense spending--for \\nNIH, FDA and CDC. Because defense of this country doesn't just mean \\ntroops on the ground or drones in the air. Defense of this country also \\nmeans helping defend families in their fights against the very real \\ndiseases that touch their lives every day, like cancer, Parkinson's, \\nALS and Alzheimer's. The only way to help those families is to lift the \\ncaps. These current budget caps are caps on innovation, caps on \\nprogress, caps on cures, caps on new treatments and caps on how far NIH \\ncan go.\\n    That's why I've been fighting for a 2-year budget deal that lifts \\nthe caps equally for non-defense spending. Now that we have a CR in \\nplace through December 11, it is time for Leaders across the aisle and \\nacross the dome to come together. It's time to get a budget deal worked \\nout. One that ends sequester and lifts the caps. A budget deal would \\npave the way for this Appropriations Committee to put together a \\ngovernment spending bill that makes sense.\\n    Without a budget deal, we are stuck. There is simple no way for \\nthis Committee to respond to the needs of American families under the \\ncurrent caps. Case in point is the fiscal year 2016 Labor-HHS bill \\nreported out of this committee.\\n    Chairman Blunt did his best considering the limited funding he was \\ngiven. But he had to rob Peter to pay Paul. Yes, he was able to give \\nNIH a $2 billion increase. But in order to do so he had to cut funding \\nform the Social Security Administration, which would have to close down \\nfield offices and processing centers, making it harder for people to \\nget their Social Security checks. He had to gut the Corporation for \\nNational and Community Service, which helps improve education from pre-\\nschool up, recover and rebuild communities from natural disasters, and \\nsupports veterans and military families during deployment. He also had \\nto cut the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, making it harder \\nfor seniors, children and those of modest means access needed \\nhealthcare services.\\n    But I also know that NIH cannot be expected to accomplish our \\nshared goals if they are operating paycheck to paycheck, crisis to \\ncrisis, shutdown to shutdown. They need stable and reliable funding. \\nThey need to know that their budget can support multi-year grants. They \\nneed to be able to tell young researchers that the United States \\nGovernment values them and will support their work in years to come.\\n    A budget deal is the only way to get this done.\\n    Thank you.\\n\\n                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\n\\n\\n                     National Institutes of Health\\n\\n    Senator Blunt.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, I would be glad \\nto introduce the folks at the table with me. We are happy at \\nNIH that we have a deep bench of really remarkable scientist \\nleaders. Of the 27 institutes and centers, you will see in \\nfront of you here five of those leaders.\\n\\n                INTRODUCTION OF NIH INSTITUTE DIRECTORS\\n\\n    Starting to my left, your right, Dr. Jon R. Lorsch, the \\nDirector of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences \\n(NIGMS), an Institute which is, by the way, having a pretty big \\nday today because the Nobel Prizes in chemistry were given to, \\n2 out of 3 scientists NIGMS supported for 30 or 35 years, a \\nnice moment for NIGMS.\\n    Next to Dr. Lorsch, Dr. Walter Koroshetz, who is the \\nDirector of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders \\nand Stroke, a distinguished neurologist and basic scientist as \\nwell as a clinician.\\n    Over here on my right, Dr. Douglas Lowy, who is the acting \\nDirector of the National Cancer Institute, much recognized for \\nhis work in the development of a vaccine against HPV, which is \\nsaving many lives from cervical cancer and other cancers.\\n    Next to Dr. Lowy, Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers, Director of the \\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney \\nDiseases, and also one of those folks who is being honored this \\nevening at the Sammies Awards because he is one of the nominees \\nfor this year's awards for public service.\\n    And over on the far end, Dr. Nora D. Volkow, a highly \\nregarded scientist in the area of addiction science and the \\nscience of the brain, who serves as our able and highly \\nrecognized (by the press), because she often is in front of \\nthem talking about addiction, Director of the National \\nInstitute on Drug Abuse.\\n    That is my team. Now, I will maybe let you start the clock, \\nand I would like to tell you a few things by way of an opening \\nstatement.\\n\\n\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    It is a great honor, for my colleagues and me, to be here \\nbefore you to discuss how NIH is investing in a healthier \\nfuture for all Americans.\\n\\n                   BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH BREAKTHROUGHS\\n\\n\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n\\n    Longevity, you can see here what has happened. \\nBreakthroughs generated by NIH-supported research are behind \\nmany of the gains our country has enjoyed in health and \\nlongevity. For example, cardiovascular diseases, death rates \\nhave fallen by more than 70 percent in the last 60 years. \\nCancer death rates are now dropping by 1 percent to 2 percent \\nannually. Likewise, HIV/AIDS originally when first being \\nwritten about as a death sentence, now treatments greatly \\nextend lives, and prevention strategies and the increasing \\npotential of an effective vaccine are enabling us to envision \\nin real terms, the first AIDS-free generation.\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    So, on behalf of NIH, our employees, our grantees, the \\npatient community, I want to thank all of you for your \\ncontinued support and for holding this hearing today. We see in \\nfront of us, a remarkable landscape of biomedical opportunities \\npowered by exceptional advances in scientific knowledge and \\ntechnological innovation.\\n    This morning's announcement of those Nobel Prizes in \\nchemistry for studies of DNA repair is a compelling example of \\nhow these investments have been paying off, building upon work \\nthat has gone on over decades.\\n\\n      EMILY WHITEHEAD'S STORY AND HISTORY OF CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY\\n\\n    I would like to share with you this morning an inspiring \\nstory, another one that has emerged from decades worth of NIH-\\nfunded basic research. This is the story of cancer \\nimmunotherapy, a treatment that involves harnessing the body's \\nown immune system to fight this dreaded disease. \\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    So, I would like you to meet Emily. Emily Whitehead, back \\nin 2010 when this photo was taken, she was struggling with \\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia, a disease that, thanks to \\nadvances made possible by NIH, chemotherapy can cure 90 percent \\nof the time.\\n    Unfortunately, Emily was in the other 10 percent. Her \\nprognosis after failed chemotherapy was grim. But, doctors at \\nChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia approached her parents \\nabout trying something radically different, a clinical trial of \\nan experimental approach called immunotherapy.\\n    So, I would really like to use this story to make a point \\nabout the long arc of medical research involving many \\ninvestigators and many years of work, ultimately leading to \\nEmily.\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    Let's take a brief journey back in time. The history of \\ncancer immunotherapy can be dated actually back to the 1890s. A \\nNew York surgeon, Dr. William Coley, reported success in \\ntreating a few inoperable cancers by stimulating patients' \\nimmune systems with bacterial toxins.\\n    But, his results were highly variable. The treatment was \\nvery toxic. And this approach largely fell by the wayside until \\nthe mid-1980s. \\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    Then, at the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Steven \\nRosenberg explored the ability of certain immune cells called \\ncytotoxic T cells to destroy tumor cells. He wondered why the \\nimmune system does not recognize cancer cells all the time and \\neliminate them, and whether the immune system could be helped \\nto do this by taking these T cells out of the body, stimulating \\nthem with an activating factor, and then re-infusing them to \\nthe cancer patient.\\n    It did not always work, but there were some dramatic \\nresponses.\\n    Dr. Steven Rosenberg was and is a true pioneer. In a \\nwonderful stroke of timing, Steven was named this morning as \\nthe Federal employee of the year by the Partnership for Public \\nService and will be recognized in the Sammies Award ceremony \\nthis evening. \\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    Meanwhile, the recombinant DNA revolution was gathering \\nmomentum. Basic research spearheaded, again in large part by \\nNIH, led to the discovery of methods to splice fragments of DNA \\ntogether, giving birth to the whole field of biotechnology.\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    Armed with this powerful set of tools and technologies, \\nNIH-supported researcher Dr. James Allison pioneered one \\nparticular form of cancer immunotherapy. He discovered that a \\nparticular protein on the surface of those T cells actually \\nacts as a braking system, preventing the full activation of the \\nimmune system when a cancer is emerging.\\n    By designing and delivering an antibody that blocks that \\nprotein, Dr. Allison showed the brakes could be released. \\nDramatic responses to previously untreatable cancers began to \\nappear.\\n    Again, another award. Dr. Allison just received the Lasker \\nAward, America's Nobel Prize, for this work last month.\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    Building on this growing momentum, other scientists like \\nDr. Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania, who is one of \\nEmily's doctors--and his lab, I know, Chairman Blunt has \\nrecently visited--have been busy designing even more precise \\ncancer immunotherapies.\\n    In the approach designed by June's group, T cells are \\ncollected from cancer patients and engineered in the lab using \\nrecombinant DNA so that they can produce special proteins on \\ntheir surface, called chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs. When \\nthose modified cells are infused back into patients, they \\nmultiply. With guidance from their newly engineered receptors, \\nthey seek and destroy the tumor cells.\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    Let me just show you how these killer T cells seek and \\ndestroy cancer cells with a quick video. This is pretty \\ndynamic, and the results can be dramatic.\\n    So, that is a T cell that you see, there lit up in red. It \\nis busy migrating around on this Petri dish. It is looking for \\nforeign invaders.\\n    Now you will see when it finds a cancer cell, it is going \\nto get really excited. There, you see the cancer cell in blue, \\nthe T cell really going after it.\\n    Now I'm going to change the colors on you in this next \\nlittle clip. The T cells are now in green, and the cancer cells \\nare red. Watch for the red flash. That is where the T cell just \\nruptured the membrane of the cancer cell and sent it off to the \\ncancer cell graveyard. You can watch this happening repeatedly \\nwith different cancer cells being targeted by these T cells \\nthat go after them and figure out how to do away with them.\\n    You can see why one of Dr. Steven Rosenberg's recent \\npatients refers to those T cells as little ninja warriors. They \\ndo their job.\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    This is not just the future of cancer treatment; it is the \\npresent. But again, note that this was built on decades of \\nwork. In fact, going back to Dr. Allison, a recent analysis \\nshows that the pathway that led to his Lasker Award included \\nthe contributions of 7,000 scientists over more than a century, \\nwith many of those scientists pursuing basic questions that had \\nno apparent connection to cancer.\\n    So, I tell you this story to emphasize the critical need \\nfor Federal investment in this whole spectrum, from basic to \\ntranslational to clinical research. If we do that, we can \\nrealize our vision of accelerating discovery across this vast \\nlandscape of biomedicine, and ultimately save many lives.\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    Remember little Emily? Here she is today, a junior \\nbridesmaid, the picture of health. This happy picture made \\npossible by her parents' decision to go ahead and enroll her in \\nthat pioneering cancer immunotherapy trial. Twenty-eight days \\nafter that treatment, Emily was cancer-free. And more than 5 \\nyears later, she remains cancer-free. \\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    Emily is just one success story. I can tell you many more, \\nincluding all these folks across the entire NIH portfolio, \\nabout how basic scientific inquiry is leading to a healthier \\nfuture for all Americans, from the development of \\nneurotechnologies through the Brain Initiative, to the million \\nor more cohort person in the Precision Medicine Initiative that \\nwill generate knowledge applicable to an entire range of health \\nand disease. \\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    I would say, our future has never been brighter. But to \\nrealize that future, NIH needs your sustained support.\\n    So thank you, Mr. Chairman. My colleagues and I very much \\nwelcome your questions.\\n    [The statement follows:]\\n         Prepared Statement of Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.\\n    Good morning, Chairman Blunt, Ranking Member Murray, and \\ndistinguished members of the subcommittee. I am Francis S. Collins, \\nM.D., Ph.D., and I am the Director of the National Institutes of Health \\n(NIH). It is an honor to appear before you today to discuss how NIH is \\ninvesting in a healthier future for all Americans.\\n    NIH has been advancing our understanding of health and disease for \\nmore than a century. Scientific and technological breakthroughs \\ngenerated by NIH-supported research are behind many of the improvements \\nour country has enjoyed in public health. For example, our Nation has \\ngained about 1 year of longevity every 6 years since 1990.\\\\1\\\\ A child \\nborn today can look forward to an average lifespan of about 78 years--\\nnearly three decades longer than a baby born in 1900. Deaths from heart \\nattack and stroke have been reduced by more than 70 percent in the past \\n60 years. Thanks to NIH-developed anti-viral therapies, HIV-infected \\npeople in their 20s today can expect to live into their 70s. This \\ncompares to a life expectancy measured in months when the disease first \\nappeared in the 1980s. Cancer death rates have been dropping about 1 \\npercent annually for the past 15 years. These are extraordinary \\nstrides--but we aim to go much further.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64 02.pdf.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    On behalf of NIH, our employees, grantees, and patient community, I \\nwant to thank the Members of this Subcommittee for your continued \\nsupport, and for holding this hearing today.\\n    This investment could not come at a better time. We are in the \\nmidst of a remarkable stream of scientific advances spurred by dramatic \\nadvances in biotechnology. Today, I want to share with you a few of the \\nmany promising opportunities before us that will lead to a healthier \\nfuture for all. I can assure you that the future of scientific research \\nhas never been brighter.\\n    Many recent breakthroughs stem from our Nation's commitment to \\ninvesting in basic science research. Basic science lays the foundation \\nfor advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention by \\nproviding the building blocks for clinical applications. Basic science \\nis generally not supported in the private sector, and NIH's focus on \\nunderstanding fundamental biological processes fosters innovation and \\nultimately leads to effective ways to treat complex medical conditions. \\nBut the lead time for medical breakthroughs to arise from basic science \\nresearch is often measured in decades, and it is generally not possible \\nto predict which basic investigations are going to be the most fruitful \\nin the long run. NIH's successful investment in basic science is \\nreflected by the awarding of 145 Nobel prizes to NIH-supported \\nscientists; the vast majority of these individuals were recognized for \\nbasic science advances.\\n    A compelling example of how we are trying to unravel life's \\nmysteries through basic science is with the Brain Research through \\nAdvancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. With nearly \\n100 billion neurons and 100 trillion connections, the human brain \\nremains one of the most daunting frontiers of science and one of the \\ngreatest challenges in medicine. This bold, multi-agency effort to \\nrevolutionize our understanding of the human brain will require the \\ndevelopment of entirely new technologies. Engineers, computer \\nscientists, nanotechnologists, physicians, and neuroscientists will \\nneed to work together and challenge the limits of their respective \\nfields of science. By measuring real-time activity at the scale of \\ncomplex neural networks in living organisms, we can explore how the \\nbrain enables the human body to record, process, utilize, store, and \\nretrieve vast quantities of information--all at the speed of thought. \\nUltimately, the foundation of understanding developed by the BRAIN \\nInitiative will help reveal the underlying pathology in a vast array of \\nbrain disorders and provide new therapeutic avenues to treat, cure, and \\nprevent neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's \\ndisease, autism, schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, and addiction.\\n    Five years ago, a project like this would have been considered \\nimpossible. But with your support, it is now underway. The first two \\nrounds of grant awards have been made--and they are tremendously \\nexciting. In the year since the inaugural round of awards, totaling $46 \\nmillion, was issued, several exciting new tools and techniques have \\nbeen developed for studying brain structure and function. One such \\ntechnique, called Drop-Seq, groups neurons based on the genes that they \\nexpress, getting us closer to having a complete parts list for the \\nbrain. Another tool, called DREADD (Designer Receptors Exclusively \\nActivated by Designer Drugs), used designer drugs to turn on and off \\ngenetically engineered neural receptors. While its inventors used \\nDREADD to precisely control a mouse's motor movements, the tool may \\npotentially provide a way to restore proper neural function. Among the \\nsecond round of awards, totaling $85 million, announced last week are \\nprojects aimed at delivering targeted electrical pulses to the brain to \\ntreat illnesses such as traumatic brain injury and epilepsy, as well as \\ncollaborations with physicists towards building non-invasive tools that \\ncan observe neural activity deep within the brain with unprecedented \\nspatial detail.\\n    We need to continue to ramp up this effort, and we need your \\nsupport for that, as requested in the President's Budget. While the \\ngoals of this initiative are ambitious, the time is right to inspire a \\nnew generation of neuroscientists to undertake this groundbreaking \\napproach to understanding the human brain.\\n    Another area of exceptional scientific opportunity I want to \\nhighlight today involves one of our Nation's most feared killers: \\ncancer. Until recently, our weapons for attacking cancer have been \\nlargely limited to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy--all of which \\ncan be effective, but carry risks and toxicities. Now, after years of \\nintense basic and translational research, we have two exciting new \\npossibilities: targeted therapeutics and cancer immunotherapy. I want \\nto particularly focus on the latter.\\n    Researchers have long been puzzled by the uncanny ability of cancer \\ncells to evade the immune response. What stops the body from waging its \\nown ``war on cancer?'' As it turns out, our bodies have important \\nbuilt-in checkpoints to prevent our immune systems from running amok \\nand killing healthy cells. Certain white blood cells called T-cells--\\nthe armed soldiers of the immune system--are designed to go after \\nforeign invaders, but they also need a stop signal to prevent going \\ninto overdrive. One way to do this is through a receptor on the T-cell \\ncalled CTLA-4 that inhibits its function. Tumor cells have figured out \\nhow to take advantage of this pathway by upregulating CTLA-4; the \\nresult is to put the brakes on the immune system, giving the green \\nlight for the cancer to grow.\\n    NIH-funded researchers have discovered a way to release the brakes \\nby introducing a monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4, allowing the \\nnormal immune response to be re-activated. Dr. James Allison, who led \\nthe basic science efforts that led to these insights, was just honored \\nwith the receipt of the Lasker Award, the ``American Nobel Prize.'' \\nPromising results in patients with metastatic melanoma and lung cancer \\nare making this and other immunotherapies the breakthrough treatment of \\nthe future. After President Carter was diagnosed with stage 4 \\nmetastatic melanoma, he received immunotherapy as part of his \\ntreatment.\\n    A final area I wish to highlight is precision medicine. As you \\nknow, in his State of the Union address in January of this year, \\nPresident Obama announced his intention to launch the Precision \\nMedicine Initiative (PMI). This is a bold new research effort to \\nrevolutionize the prevention and treatment of disease, and I thank the \\nCommittee for including the requested $200 million for PMI in its \\nfiscal year 2016 appropriations bill. We believe that the time is right \\nfor this audacious undertaking, and, with your support, the NIH and our \\nHHS partners, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Office \\nof Civil Rights, and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health \\nInformation Technology (ONC), will work with great intensity to achieve \\nthis vision.\\n    Historically, physicians have had to make most recommendations \\nabout disease prevention and treatment based on the expected response \\nof the average patient. This one-size-fits-all approach works for some \\npatients and some conditions, but not others. Precision medicine is an \\ninnovative approach that takes into account individual differences in \\npatients' genes, environments, and lifestyles. This concept is not new; \\nblood typing, for example, has been used to guide blood transfusions \\nfor a century. Prescription eyeglasses are tailored specifically to the \\npatient's individual needs. Moreover, the identification of the BRCA1 \\nand BRCA2 genes has made it possible to provide options for women at \\nhigh risk for breast and ovarian cancers. And, the gene implicated in \\ncystic fibrosis has led to widespread availability of screening and \\ntargeted therapeutics.\\n    The prospect of applying this concept broadly to virtually all \\ndiseases, and to disease prevention, has been dramatically improved by \\nthe development of powerful and affordable methods for characterizing \\npersonal biological attributes (such as genomics and metabolomics), the \\nwidespread adoption of electronic health records, the recent revolution \\nin mobile health technologies, and the emergence of computational tools \\nfor analyzing large biomedical data sets. These advances will help make \\npossible the dream of personalizing a wide range of health \\napplications.\\n    With this in mind, we are excited to take a lead in the two key \\ncomponents of the President's Precision Medicine Initiative that will \\nbe managed by NIH. First is a near-term goal that will focus on cancer, \\nbuilding on advances in genomics and immunology that make it \\nincreasingly possible for specific therapies to be designed for the \\nindividual, based on the precise molecular characteristics of their \\ntumor. Second is a longer-term aim to generate knowledge applicable to \\nthe whole range of health and disease. Both components are within \\nreach, due in large part to recent scientific breakthroughs. Let me \\ntell you just a little bit more about the longer term project.\\n    In order to achieve the President's ambitious plan, NIH will build \\na large national research cohort of one million or more Americans that \\nwill provide the platform for expanding our knowledge of precision \\nmedicine approaches and benefit the Nation for years to come. These \\nvolunteer participants will agree to share health information, provide \\nbiospecimens, and wear sensors that will detect environmental exposures \\nand body performance--all with appropriate privacy protection. They \\nwill be true partners in this research. Not subjects, not patients-- \\npartners. They will play an active role in how their genetic, \\nenvironmental, and medical information is used for the prevention of \\nillness and management of a wide array of chronic diseases. The goal \\nwill be to expand the benefits of precision medicine into myriad \\naspects of health and healthcare. Participants will be at the center of \\nthe project design, and they will have access to their own health data, \\nas well as research using their data, to help inform their own health \\ndecisions. Through this dynamic community, researchers will be able to \\nadvance the information derived from this cohort into new knowledge, \\napproaches, and treatments. Researchers from many organizations will, \\nwith proper protection of patient information, have access to the \\ncohort's data so that the world's brightest scientific and clinical \\nminds can contribute insights.\\n    In order to help inform the vision for building the national \\nresearch cohort of one million or more volunteers, I formed a Precision \\nMedicine Initiative Working Group, as part of my Advisory Committee, to \\ndevelop a specific design plan for creating and managing such a \\nresearch cohort. To help carry out its charge, the Working Group \\nengaged with stakeholders and members of the public through workshops \\nand requests for information, focusing on issues related to the design \\nand oversight of the cohort. Public engagement, as well as internal \\ndiscussions, led to the vision for the design and utility of the \\nprogram, and the Working Group released their report just three weeks \\nago. The report includes recommendations in six areas critical to the \\ndevelopment, implementation, and oversight: cohort assembly, \\nparticipant engagement, data, biobanking, policy, and governance. We \\nplan to move swiftly to build the infrastructure so that participants \\ncan begin enrolling in the cohort in 2016, with a goal of at least one \\nmillion participants by 2020.\\n    A project of this magnitude will lay the foundation for a myriad of \\nnew prevention strategies and novel therapeutics. Although the \\ninitiative will likely yield its greatest benefits years down the road, \\nthere will be successes in the relatively near future as well. Moving \\nforward, this pioneering research initiative will require the \\ninvolvement of many different sectors of science and society, including \\nbiologists, physicians, technology developers, data scientists, \\nhealthcare organizations, and, most importantly, the American people. \\nGiven related efforts in a few other countries, we will aim to forge \\ncollaborations on a global scale.\\n    With sufficient resources and a strong, sustained commitment of \\ntime, energy, and ingenuity from the scientific, medical, and \\nparticipant communities, precision medicine's full potential can be \\nrealized to give everyone the best chance at good health. There's no \\nbetter time than now to embark on this ambitious new enterprise to \\nrevolutionize medicine and generate the scientific evidence necessary \\nto move this individualized approach into everyday clinical practice.\\n    Today, I have outlined for you just a few of the very many \\npromising scientific opportunities on the horizon. With your support, \\nthe future of medicine can be very bright. This concludes my testimony, \\nand my colleagues and I look forward to answering your questions.\\n\\n    Senator Blunt. Well, thank you very much, Dr. Collins. I am \\ncertainly glad you are here.\\n\\n                           CURE VS. TREATMENT\\n\\n    Let me ask a couple questions. Senator Toomey and I went to \\nsee what Dr. Carl June was doing. That effort, you can correct \\nme where I am wrong here, very much focused on what the \\nindividual patient needs. Dozens of individual patients at all \\nage groups have seen success in that particular effort.\\n    But two thoughts about that. One is, is this likely in \\ncases like this to go beyond treatment to the level of where, \\nin this particular case, this particular fighting agent is \\nalways there, so you are talking about a cure instead of \\ntreatment? I would be interested in what discussion is going \\non, how we look at a world where cure is one of the options as \\nopposed to a healthcare world that has largely been defined by \\ntreatment up until now.\\n    I will just go ahead and ask my second question at the same \\ntime, which is, on these individual cases, I would assume at \\nsome point one of the challenges is what we do that makes that \\nmost likely to be scalable, so that every patient does not have \\nall of the expense of a unique treatment, but a scalable effort \\nmade that will come naturally.\\n    But talk to me about those two things, and whoever you \\nwould like to answer those questions.\\n    Dr. Collins. Those are great questions, Mr. Chairman. I \\nthink I will turn to Dr. Lowy as the acting Director of the \\nNational Cancer Institute, who is investing in big ways in \\ncancer immunotherapy, to address both of those.\\n    Dr. Lowy. Thank you, Senator Blunt.\\n    This is really a critical juncture right now because we \\nhave opportunities for long-term responses. And what you are \\nasking is, are a subset of those responses going to lead to \\ncure? And we certainly are optimistic and hopeful that this \\nwill happen, at least in some cases.\\n    We need to understand better, as you point out, what the \\nmechanisms are that drive the important clinical responses to \\nimmunotherapy. And if we can understand them better, we may be \\nable to devise even more effective immunotherapies that also \\nwill have fewer side effects.\\n    That is an area that we really are actively supporting \\ninvestigations in, because we do hope eventually that we can \\nget to the area of precision and predictive oncology where \\npatients, we know what treatment to give to them and we know \\nwhat kind of immunotherapy to give to them, in addition to \\ntargeted treatments. Thank you.\\n    Dr. Collins. In terms of the scalability, which is a tough \\nquestion for some of the very personalized immunotherapy that \\nyou saw in Carl June's lab, there are certainly strong \\ninterests in companies in figuring out how to do this, where \\nyou can, in fact, make this available to thousands of patients \\ninstead of in small trials. We would think that is a very \\nappropriate kind of place for public-private partnerships to \\nspring up, so that this idea of engineering your own T cells to \\ngo after your cancer could be done for more and more \\nindividuals.\\n    Senator Blunt. I would just say, before I turn to Senator \\nMurray, that this is a topic that I am having some discussions \\nwith people representing health insurance companies. Are you \\nthinking about a future where traditional treatment may be less \\nexpensive initially but a long-term potential cure more \\nexpensive initially but less expensive over time? What are your \\nstandards going to be? Are you thinking what we can do now?\\n    Really, the whole concept, I am sure we will get to, of \\ndesigner medicine, what can happen with the efforts, Dr. \\nVolkow, on the brain and how that those impacts?\\n    I think we will have time for more than one round of \\nquestions. We have a couple people on a timeframe. We will try \\nto get to them quickly. We will do this by order of both \\nappearance and, if you were here on time, seniority on the \\ncommittee.\\n    The first person to go to is Senator Murray.\\n    Senator Murray. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\n\\n       EFFECT OF YEAR-LONG CONTINUING RESOLUTION ON NIH RESEARCH\\n\\n    Dr. Collins, as you know, we are working on a continuing \\nresolution until December 11. I wanted to ask you, what effect \\nwould a yearlong CR at the current rate have on the NIH \\nresearch?\\n    Dr. Collins. Believe me, we are thinking and worrying a lot \\nabout that. We are in a circumstance where, perhaps emboldened \\nby the enthusiasm, we have seen in both the Senate and House in \\nfiscal year 2016 budget process, I have a number of very \\nexciting initiatives that we would like to launch in fiscal \\nyear 2016, the Precision Medicine Initiative, which I am sure \\nwe will talk about in the course of this hearing; the BRAIN \\nInitiative, which is already underway now for 2 years but is at \\na critical point to ramp up and build on what has already been \\ndone; the ability to be able to push our vaccine strategies for \\ninfluenza, for HIV/AIDS. All of those are at a critical point \\nwhere more investment is needed.\\n    We have been heartened, greatly, by the actions of this \\nCommittee and a similar Committee in the House to believe that \\nwe might have the chance to do these things.\\n    A yearlong CR, unless an anomaly were possible for NIH, \\nwould be simply devastating. The Precision Medicine Initiative, \\nfor instance, would basically have to go into the freezer or on \\nmothballs or whatever the appropriate discouraging metaphor \\nwould be.\\n    We would just be at the point of starting this effort to \\nenroll 1 million Americans in this unprecedented study and \\ncarry out exciting new studies in cancer genomics, and those \\nwould basically have to go on hold. That would be enormously \\ndisappointing.\\n    Similarly, imagine the BRAIN Initiative, which is on this \\nexciting ramp. It would, basically, have to take a pause for a \\nyear just at the point when the momentum is building.\\n    I cannot emphasize enough how much we are worried about \\nthis. We can struggle along with the CR until December 11, but \\nif it is a yearlong CR without an anomaly, it is going to be a \\ndark day, indeed, a dark year, indeed.\\n    Senator Murray. Thank you very much.\\n\\n                     SHORTAGES IN TREATMENT CENTERS\\n\\n    Dr. Volkow, more than 20 million people in the United \\nStates have a substance abuse problem. We know that only a \\nsmall percent of that population will get help and that those \\nlooking for treatment often cannot find it because of long \\nwaiting times for care or because of limited insurance \\ncoverage.\\n    The work that National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) does \\nto address addiction is critical, but I really worry that \\ncutting funding for treatment and recovery, as the \\nSubcommittee's 2016 bill would do, would make it very hard for \\naddicts to get the help they need, especially at a time when \\n44,000 more Americans now die annually from overdoses than they \\ndo in car crashes.\\n    The substance abuse block grant that represented 42 percent \\nof State spending on substance abuse as recently as 2007, that \\nshare would likely drop to below 32 percent under this \\nsubcommittee's bill.\\n    I wanted to ask you, and take advantage of you being here \\ntoday, are you seeing shortages in treatment services around \\nthe country for addicts who want help? If so, does that concern \\nyou?\\n    Dr. Volkow. Unfortunately, the answer is yes. Of course, it \\nconcerns us, because the problem of drug addiction is actually \\none that has been increasing in our country. We have known all \\nalong that only 15 to 20 percent of those addicted receive \\ntreatment.\\n    Senator Murray. Fifteen percent?\\n    Dr. Volkow. Fifteen percent.\\n    Senator Murray. Only 15 percent of the people who ask for \\nhelp?\\n    Dr. Volkow. No, 15 percent of individuals that have \\naddiction receive it. Not all of them search for treatment, but \\none of the reasons they do not search for treatment is they are \\ndiscouraged by the lack of infrastructure to support their \\nneeds, as well as the issue of stigma.\\n    So those are two aspects that have made it very, very \\ndifficult to provide treatment.\\n    What NIDA is doing is trying to take advantage of \\ninfrastructure that we have in our country to maximize their \\ninvolvement in substance use disorders. That includes the \\nhealthcare system, the criminal justice system. Those two are \\nstructures that we are engaging to provide with evidence-based \\ntreatment that can improve outcomes.\\n\\n                  BRAIN INITIATIVE AND CANCER RESEARCH\\n\\n    Senator Murray. Dr. Koroshetz, I wanted to ask you, I know \\nthe BRAIN Initiative recently released its second round of \\nawards, bringing NIH investment to $85 million for 2015. Can \\nyou tell us about the progress you have already made under the \\nBRAIN Initiative?\\n    Dr. Koroshetz. Yes, happy to do so. The BRAIN Initiative is \\nincredibly exciting. It is off to a great start, as Francis \\nmentioned. The center of the BRAIN Initiative is developing new \\ntechnologies to allow us to monitor, interrogate, and also \\nmodulate brain circuit activity. If you think about it, that is \\nreally what patients are suffering from, disorders in brain \\ncircuitry activity.\\n    The problem is that we do not have the technologies to \\nmodulate those circuits except in a very unsophisticated \\nmanner. So some things have already come out that are really, \\nreally exciting.\\n    A couple of examples, there is a new technology, in which \\nyou can put an artificial gene into particular neurons in the \\nbrain, and with a drug that has no other effects you can turn \\non or turn off precisely certain neuron types in the brain. \\nThis is really an amazing feat to be able to do that.\\n    Contrast that with treatment for Parkinson's disease, where \\na wire is put into the brain and an electric current is sent \\nin, and it goes willy-nilly. No one knows exactly what it is \\ndoing, but it turned out to be quite effective.\\n    You can just imagine how these new precision technologies \\ncan completely change how we can basically normalize or cause \\ncompensation in brain circuits for patients' neurologic \\ndeficits. So it is really quite exciting.\\n    Senator Murray. Thank you.\\n    Unfortunately, my time is up, so I will wait for the second \\nround.\\n    Senator Blunt. We are fortunate to have the chairman of the \\nfull committee and the ranking member of the full committee \\nwith us.\\n    Senator Cochran.\\n\\n                           COMBATING DIABETES\\n\\n    Senator Cochran. Mr. Chairman, thank you.\\n    In my State of Mississippi, we have one of the highest \\nrates of type 2 diabetes in the Nation. We are told that over \\n12.5 percent of our State's adults have the disease, and the \\nproblem is growing rapidly.\\n    Are there any new approaches that you have in mind in \\ndealing with hotspots, outbreaks, whatever you want to call it, \\nin areas like our State?\\n    Dr. Collins. That is a great question for Dr. Rodgers, \\nsince his institute oversees diabetes research at NIH.\\n    Dr. Rodgers. Thank you, Senator, for the question.\\n    Type 2 diabetes is increasing at an alarming level. There \\nare currently about 29 million people in the U.S. with diabetes \\nand 86 million who have prediabetes. There are two things that \\nwe're doing about that.\\n    Number one, for people who have established diabetes, there \\nis a common drug that is started on patients called metformin. \\nBut unfortunately, in the great majority of patients, that drug \\nwill no longer be effective.\\n    We've started a trial in which we are characterizing the \\ncombination of metformin with one of four different classes of \\ndrugs to see what the next effective drug would be for given \\nindividuals. This is actually a trial that involves 5,000 \\nindividuals in 45 centers around the country to determine the \\neffectiveness. This really will eventually get to the area of \\nprecision medicine.\\n    The second thing for those people who are sort of \\nunderneath the iceberg, the 86 million Americans who have a \\npossibility of going on to develop diabetes, we have tried to \\ntranslate a very effective Diabetes Prevention Program to scale \\nthis up in a way, to offer this lifestyle, which was quite \\neffective in these patients, to prevent them or delay them from \\nbecoming a diabetic.\\n    These will have an important financial role in the future, \\nin terms of cutting costs.\\n    Senator Blunt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Mikulski.\\n    Senator Mikulski. Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for \\norganizing this hearing.\\n    To our colleagues from NIH, this is the committee and the \\nmembers here today are the pragmatists. When you look at us, we \\nhave a chairman who is very much dedicated to NIH, certainly a \\nvice chairman who is. We have the authorizers here in terms of \\nMurray and Alexander.\\n    All of us here have a history of support for this, so you \\nhave people who really want to be nonpartisan. So I want you to \\nknow that.\\n    Dr. Collins. Thank you.\\n\\n                             NIH WISH LIST\\n\\n    Senator Mikulski. We are stymied by our own processes. When \\nI first arrived in the Senate, we had a triad that worked. \\nAuthorizing would often create great policy on a bipartisan \\nbasis, Kennedy-Hatch, Kennedy-Kassebaum, et cetera. We had \\nappropriations that really could move the ball forward. And we \\nhad a budget process that gave us an orderly methodology \\nprocess for doing that.\\n    So we have problems here. So we have big problems here. I \\nknow that you live them out every single day.\\n    Colleagues, when I visit the National Institutes of Health, \\nwhich has been my great joy to represent for 28 years, I call \\nit the ``National Institutes of Hope.'' This is what we just \\nheard here, the National Institutes of Hope, in both what they \\ndo on the campus in Bethesda, but also what they do through the \\ngreat extramural research like at the University of Maryland \\nand Johns Hopkins.\\n    Dr. Lorsch, you are a Hopkins guy. They are going to \\ndedicate a room the Hopkins Club, the faculty club, 2 weeks \\nfrom now. Thirty-eight people associated with Hopkins have won \\nthe Nobel Prize, two-thirds of that have been in life \\nsciences--38 people, one university--but because of the role \\nthat our government plays in doing that.\\n    But we are an economic engine. When you think about the \\njobs that are created because of you in pharmaceuticals, \\nbiomedical, medical devices. You are a turbo engine.\\n    So rather than seeing you as a cost factor, we should see \\nyou as an economic generator. And I hope that we can be able to \\ndo that.\\n    I am deeply concerned about the caps. I do not like budget \\ncaps. Most of all, I don't like the caps on innovation. We \\ncannot continue to cap innovation. We cannot cap breakthroughs. \\nWe cannot cap the opportunity for young people to dream for \\nthese careers like Dr. Rosenberg and all of you have here.\\n    So here is my question to you. When we look at both the \\nresearch to be done and the workforce that needs to do it, I \\nworry about the young investigator and the debt that they carry \\nthat is a deterrent to pursuing this.\\n    Could you tell me, if we could go down the table, if we \\nlifted the caps and went to President Obama's budget, nothing \\nmore, President Obama's budget, what would be the three things \\neach and every one of you could do? And also, how would it \\nimpact young investigators?\\n    Dr. Collins. Okay, folks, there is the challenge. Maybe we \\nshould just quickly go down the table.\\n    Nora, do you want to kick this off?\\n    Dr. Volkow. You want three of them?\\n    Senator Mikulski. If you just have one, one would be \\nenough.\\n\\n                                  NIDA\\n\\n    Dr. Volkow. No, no. Number one is we would accelerate the \\ndevelopment of medication for addiction. There are many very \\ninteresting potential targets. But since the pharmaceutical \\nindustry is not investing, that responsibility relies in the \\nFederal Government money, predominantly through the NIH. So \\nthat would be one.\\n    The second one would be to expand the study to understand \\nhow drugs affect the development of the human brain. We now \\nhave that technology. We should have that information. That \\nwill inform prevention efforts.\\n    The third one will relate to actually making research \\ncareers more accessible to the young investigators so that we \\ndo not lose talent.\\n\\n                                 NIDDK\\n\\n    Dr. Rodgers. I would just expand upon that. I would say \\nthat the three areas that I would focus on are the young \\ninvestigators. We know that there are two critical points in \\nwhich an investigator is likely to stay in research or exit. \\nOne is on their first application to get a grant. The second is \\ngetting that renewed. If they get through that second hurdle, \\nit is likely that they are going to be with us a long time. So \\nwe would like to encourage them by making incentives for both \\nthe first application, as well as the first renewal.\\n    The other point that I would make is that with expanded \\nfunds, we would be able to allow for expansion of some of our \\nexisting clinical studies, which are very expensive, because of \\nthe curtail that we would have to do. One way to amplify the \\ninvestment in infrastructure in these clinical trials is by \\nhaving ancillary studies to these trials. So I would expand \\nexisting trials, as well as ancillary studies to these trials.\\n\\n                                  NCI\\n\\n    Dr. Lowy. Thank you, Senator Mikulski. In the question of \\nyoung people, we at NCI are in the process of trying to develop \\nnew approaches to enhance their ability to move from being \\ngraduate students and postdoctoral fellows to starting their \\nown laboratories. The areas where we would invest would be in \\ncancer prevention, cancer screening, and cancer treatment, \\nusing molecular precision medicine approaches, which have \\nenormous potential in those areas.\\n    I would highlight the potential of immunotherapy, as was \\ndiscussed earlier, because of the issue of its potential for \\nimproved responses, decreased side effects, and scalability, as \\nSenator Blunt mentioned.\\n\\n                                 NINDS\\n\\n    Dr. Koroshetz. In terms of research projects, we talked \\nabout the BRAIN Initiative. There is also the National Action \\nPlan for Alzheimer's Disease Research. Both of those have \\nmilestones. It is all planned out. If we had the funding, we \\ncould really accelerate both of those major projects.\\n    In terms of young people, I think supporting young \\ninvestigators is incredibly important. The average age of \\nbecoming independent with an NIH grant is now going to the mid-\\n40s. We have to move that down. We have a couple of things that \\nwe are considering at NINDS to support somebody who is really \\nyoung, who really looks bright, and just give them a chance \\nmuch, much earlier in their career.\\n\\n                                 NIGMS\\n\\n    Dr. Lorsch. My institute mostly funds fundamental basic \\nresearch. The great ideas that lead to the discoveries that Dr. \\nCollins told you about in basic research do not come from me \\nand, as much as I esteem my colleagues, do not come from them. \\nThey come from the great brilliant minds at the universities, \\ninstitutions in your districts across the country. We would \\nfocus on supporting investigator-initiated research to promote \\nthese brilliant scientists to do their work.\\n    As a measure of that, and the success of my Institute, as \\nDr. Collins alluded to, has funded a number of Nobel Prizes. I \\nwould have said 81 yesterday, but as of this morning, it is now \\n83. I think that is an indication of the power of investigator-\\ninitiated research.\\n    We would certainly have a focus on promoting the careers of \\nthe young scientists who will win the Nobel Prizes of the \\nfuture.\\n    Senator Blunt. I will point out that only Senator Mikulski \\ngets 50 percent more time than she is allocated. That is \\ntotally fine with me.\\n    One of the things I did want to do today was get on the \\nrecord the kinds of things you would do now. Strictly speaking, \\nto Senator Mikulski's question, the President asked for half of \\nthe increase that the Committee has proposed that you get. So I \\nam going to look very carefully at all the things you said you \\nwould do if you had the President's number, and assume I can \\nmultiply that by two, and those will be the things you would do \\nif you had the number the Committee is proposing that you get \\nat NIH.\\n    Mr. Shelby.\\n    Senator Shelby. Thank you.\\n\\n                          $3 BILLION INCREASE?\\n\\n    Dr. Collins, picking up on what Senator Blunt said, talking \\nabout money, funding, which is important, say you had $3 \\nbillion more, above, what could you do with it, as far as \\ninvestigating and hoping to turn a lot of the investigative \\nresults into better health and better treatment? What would $3 \\nbillion--just use that. I made it up, but I hope we could do \\nsomething for you. What would it do for you? What would it do \\nfor us, everybody?\\n    Dr. Collins. Yes, what would it do for America, for the \\nworld? Senator, I appreciate the question. It is a lovely thing \\nto contemplate. As you have heard, we have lost over the last \\n12 years, about 22 percent of our purchasing power.\\n    This would be about a 10 percent increase. It would not \\nquite get us back to where we were in 2003, but, oh my gosh, it \\nwould be an enormous shot in the arm to a community that has \\nsuch talent and such energy and is basically being squeezed to \\nthe point that a lot of innovation that we could be doing is \\njust not happening.\\n    You heard from my colleagues the areas they would pick from \\ntheir own particular domains. I am sitting here thinking about \\nthe other institute directors who are not here. I will mention \\na couple others that I would want to put on that short list, \\nthat if they were here they might speak to.\\n    Vaccines, I mean, we are on the brink of being able to \\ndevelop a vaccine that would work against all influenza \\nstrains. If Dr. Fauci was here, he would tell you all about \\nthat. We have a path toward something that would result in not \\nneeding your yearly flu shot that has to be re-engineered every \\nyear, and sometimes it works and sometimes it does not, but \\nmaybe more importantly protecting against that next worldwide \\npandemic, which is overdue. We are not pushing that as hard as \\nwe should because the resources simply are not there.\\n    Vaccine for HIV/AIDS, we really do now see a path to make \\nthat happen after 30 very frustrating years. Yet, we can't go \\nas fast on that as we would because the resources are \\nunavailable.\\n    The Precision Medicine Initiative, which we hope to start \\nin fiscal year 2016, which I think has a lot of bipartisan \\nsupport and which the scientific community, after many \\nworkshops and a working group that debated about this, is very \\njazzed about. We cannot start that if we have a yearlong CR, as \\nI said previously, in answer to Senator Murray. But we could \\nstart it, and we could ramp it up much faster if we had this \\nkind of curve to work with as far as research.\\n    Then there is this whole area that we call high-risk, high-\\nreward research. We just announced, a couple days ago, the \\nfunding of about 78 of these new awards. These are pioneer \\nawards, new innovators, early independence, and transformative \\nawards. These are NIH awards where you cannot apply unless you \\nhave an idea that is really out-of-the-box. And you do not have \\nto have a lot of preliminary data, if your idea is exciting, we \\nwant to see what you could do. Give the awardee the money and \\nlet them run with it. Many of the institutes are taking that \\ntack, but we could go faster and could inspire people to be \\nmore risk-taking, if we had that kind of opportunity.\\n    Put all that together and with $3 billion, let's try it. \\nLet's try the experiment and see how that turns out. I promise \\nyou, it would be amazing.\\n    Senator Shelby. Also, not only health, it would be a good \\neconomic investment in our country.\\n    Dr. Collins. Thank you, Senator. The repeated economic \\nanalyses demonstrate the return on investment for dollars that \\ngo to NIH is about 2.2-fold in the first year to the local \\ncommunity. And of course, our dollars go out to all 50 States.\\n\\n                     UPDATE ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES\\n\\n    Senator Shelby. I would like to touch quickly on, where are \\nwe today as far as cutting-edge research on cystic fibrosis and \\nalso a lot of the autoimmune diseases, such as lupus.\\n    Dr. Collins. Well, thank you again. Great questions and \\ngreat progress being made in that space. I have a personal, \\ndeep, and longstanding interest in cystic fibrosis, as my own \\nlaboratory found the cause of that back in 1989 when I was at \\nthe University of Michigan.\\n    This is a very exciting time for that disorder because \\nafter all those years of figuring out how that small glitch in \\nthe genome was capable of causing this disease, we now know a \\ngreat deal about the protein that is normally made and why it \\ndoes not do what it is supposed to in cystic fibrosis.\\n    Just in the last few months, we have now seen the second \\ndrug strategy approved by the FDA for the treatment of more \\nthan half of those with cystic fibrosis based upon a small \\nmolecule, a drug that is based upon molecular understanding of \\nthe disease. Very exciting times, indeed.\\n    I just want to mention one very exciting public-private \\npartnership, the Accelerating Medicines Partnership, which \\nseveral of us have been working very hard to bring together 10 \\ndrug companies with NIH to work together. And one of the \\ntargets is, in fact, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\\n    Again, I showed that picture about T cells. What is going \\non with T cells and lupus? Are they overactive? Are they going \\nafter normal tissue when they should not? What can we do with \\nthe new technologies to understand how single cells are \\nbehaving in order to come up with strategies that work better \\nthan what we currently have?\\n    So all of these areas are just full of potential right now.\\n    Senator Blunt. Thank you, Senator.\\n    Senator Durbin.\\n    Senator Durbin. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for \\nbeing here.\\n    Let me just say at the outset, to address this side of the \\nroom for a moment, gathered in this room at this moment in the \\nUnited States Senate are the 11 or 12 people who could \\nliterally make a difference for generations in medical \\nresearch, as was noted by Senator Mikulski. We have both the \\nauthorizing committee and the appropriating committee in the \\nSenate. If we took a stand, a bipartisan stand, on medical \\nresearch and said, come hell or high water, we are not going to \\ntolerate a shutdown, a sequestration, a CR. We are going to \\nincrease the funding for NIH and related medical research \\nagencies. We can make a difference.\\n    We can make it clear, do not try to get through the Senate, \\nif you are going to touch it.\\n    I want to commend the chairman, because I bothered him, \\nbegged him, challenged him for a long, long time, based on Dr. \\nCollin's admonition to me: Give me 5 percent real growth for 10 \\nyears, and I will light up the scoreboard.\\n    We have done it in this bill. I might add, parenthetically, \\nat the expense of some other things that are equally important, \\nI should say, as well.\\n    But I want to commend the chairman for making this \\ncommitment for 7 percent growth at NIH, which includes 5 \\npercent real growth at NIH. And as you said, and was asked by \\nSenator Shelby, a onetime infusion is a good thing, but \\nconstancy, predictability, is what leads to researcher \\ncommitments and long-term success in what we achieve.\\n    I would like just to throw out as a possibility that we \\nrally around one particular person who is up here.\\n    For 28 years, Barbara Mikulski has been the strongest voice \\nfor the National Institutes of Health on Capitol Hill. She is \\nleaving soon, unfortunately, for all of us. But I hope we can \\nmake a Mikulski promise that we are not going to forget the \\ncommitment of this budget and the commitment in years to come.\\n    And I will tell you this, in the time I have been in the \\nSenate, you do not want to break a promise to Barbara Mikulski. \\nIt is something you will hear about.\\n    Senator Mikulski. Well-said.\\n\\n                       UNDERSTANDING ALZHEIMER'S\\n\\n    Senator Durbin. So I hope we can be inspired by that.\\n    Let me try to bring this down to the ground level, if I \\ncan. I have two questions, if I can get to them.\\n    The first is, when we talk about $2 billion in growth, $2 \\nbillion in growth in this coming year, I need to ask you, when \\nit comes to areas like Alzheimer's, we know that we spent $154 \\nbillion on Alzheimer's treatment, just Medicare and Medicaid. \\nWe estimate that the private contribution of families is almost \\nequal to that in value. So we are talking about one-half of 1 \\npercent of what we are spending as a Nation on Alzheimer's as \\nthe delta, the $2 billion that we are looking for here.\\n    When it comes to brain research, we now have reached I \\nthink a point, please confirm if I am right, where we can start \\nto visualize the development of Alzheimer's in the brain and \\nknow many years before the obvious onset that a person is \\nmoving in that direction.\\n    What do you see, Dr. Collins, or those who are here with \\nyou, in terms of what we could do if we knew 15 years in \\nadvance that Alzheimer's was likely to occur? What could we \\nlook forward to do soon to delay it or, God willing, find a \\ncure?\\n    Dr. Collins. So, I am showing you a picture that outlines \\nthe statistics. I did not know you were going to ask the \\nquestion, but you can see what the relative numbers are here in \\nterms of what is currently being spent on Alzheimer's disease. \\nThese are 2013 numbers. Obviously, that number is now going up, \\nand we need it to. But comparing that to what we are spending, \\n$203 billion in 2013, and an estimated $1.2 trillion in 2050, \\nif nothing gets done.\\n    So, this is a matter of great urgency, not just because of \\nthe economics, of course, but also because of the enormous \\nhuman tragedies that are attached to this disease.\\n    Dr. Koroshetz, as a neurologist, Director of NINDS, can \\ntell you something about where we are on this and why we are \\noptimistic that we can actually get to a place that does not \\nresult in that enormous blue arrow.\\n    Dr. Koroshetz. Yes, thanks, Senator. I think you made a \\nreally interesting point, that for the first time, we can \\nactually see what is going on in the brain in people with \\nAlzheimer's disease. In the past, we knew what happened when \\npeople died, but we really could not see brain changes \\nhappening in living people. But now, we have brain imaging \\nmarkers for amyloid and tau, which are the major culprits in \\nAlzheimer's disease. We can see that in the brain now of living \\npeople.\\n    As you said, we can see amyloid developing years before the \\ntau starts to set in. The tau seems to be the thing that kills \\nthe cells. So Alzheimer's is like the gun. Tau is like the \\nbullet.\\n    So the vision is that we develop a screening tool for \\npeople who are developing the amyloid, determine if they are \\ngoing to develop Alzheimer's, and then come in with a drug to \\nblock that process.\\n    In fact, those drugs are currently being tested in clinical \\ntrials. So we could get lucky. I mean, this looks very, very \\npromising, at this point in time.\\n    Senator Durbin. And let me add, because Secretary Ernest \\nMoniz would hope that I would add, that this technology, which \\nallows us to visualize, our Department of Energy and Office of \\nScience had a lot to do with this.\\n    So when you talk about medical research, the technology \\nside of this equation relies on other agencies.\\n    Do I have 10 seconds? Darn it. I will try to be here for \\nthe second round.\\n    Dr. Collins. I would like to just quickly say that that is \\na very good point. We actually have a joint meeting about the \\nbrain between the Department of Energy and the NIH coming up in \\n2 weeks in Chicago.\\n    Senator Blunt. Senator Alexander.\\n    Senator Alexander. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.\\n    I am sorry Senator Mikulski left because I would like for \\nher to know that Dr. Collins played the guitar and sang at a \\nplace that Senator Durbin has been and Senator Mikulski desires \\nto go, which is the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville. It was quite a \\nshow.\\n    What is that song? Knock Out Disease?\\n    Dr. Collins. That was it. I am surprised that you remember. \\nI thought you might have suppressed the whole thing.\\n\\n                         ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN\\n\\n    Senator Alexander. It is a great hit.\\n    I mean, we all admire your work, but we also admire the \\nwork of your team. We know they could be making more money some \\nother place, but the fact that they are here and working to \\nhelp other people is something we all respect and appreciate.\\n    I asked you, Dr. Collins, earlier about the bill that \\nSenator Murray mentioned she and I are working on. We are \\ntrying to create an environment where precision medicine can \\nsucceed, where we get inventions and discoveries through the \\nprocess more rapidly.\\n    One of the problems we have is that the National Academies \\ngroups have identified that investigators, the ones that we are \\nwanting to get more money for, spend 42 percent of their time \\non administrative tasks. Now, if we are talking about millions \\nmore for investigators, shouldn't we be spending an equal \\namount of time trying to get that 42 percent down, so we create \\nmore dollars there?\\n    There is a new report headed by the former president of the \\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, which makes a number of serious \\nspecific recommendations about how to deal with that. One of \\nthem includes a research board that would coordinate an \\napproach towards the regulations and policies that effect \\nresearchers that received the $40 billion we put out, not all \\nof that through NIH, but to colleges and universities to try to \\neliminate duplication and make it more efficient.\\n    My question is, and you do not have to do it today, a lot \\nof their recommendations have to do with NIH, will you review \\nthat report, and over the next year set up a systematic way to \\nconsider making the changes that it makes? And if you have \\nimpediments either within the administration or the law that \\nwould keep you from doing that, if you could let us know, we \\nmight be able to include them in the legislation Senator Murray \\nand I are working on.\\n    Dr. Collins. Senator, I appreciate very much the role you \\nplayed in bringing this important issue to the attention of the \\nacademic community and other constituents as well, including \\nthe government.\\n    Senator Alexander. Thank you. I am going to ask you to \\nleave me about 2 minutes, because I have another question I \\nwant to ask.\\n    Dr. Collins. We will take with great seriousness this \\nreport. We have looked at it in a preliminary way. We will look \\nat it much more deeply. I think we do have a number of ideas \\nand responses to that. I will be glad to share with you about \\nhow we could do something to reduce that 42 percent.\\n\\n                        BEST FUNDING MECHANISMS\\n\\n    Senator Alexander. Thank you. I want to ask you some \\nquestions about funding, but I do not need the answers today. \\nBut I think all of us need the answers in the next few weeks.\\n    The House included something called mandatory funding as \\nwell as discretionary funding. For many of us, mandatory \\nfunding is the villain. The reason you don't have money is \\nbecause that part of the budget has gone up like this, and the \\ndiscretionary side is like this, and you are on the \\ndiscretionary side.\\n    So our visceral reaction is against any new mandatory \\nfunding. But I am convinced that this is a critical time in \\nscience and a critical time of opportunity, so I am willing to \\nthink about that. I have these questions, as I think about \\nthat. These are the questions I would like to talk with you \\nabout some time.\\n    What happens at the end of the 5 years that the House \\nproposed? There is a cliff, and you lose $2 billion. What \\nhappens then?\\n    What is the purpose of the mandatory funding? If there is a \\ndifference between discretionary funding and mandatory funding, \\ndo you just mix it all up or is there some distinct purpose \\nthat would justify a steadier stream of money toward mandatory \\nfunding? What would that be?\\n    Should there be a focus for the mandatory funding on \\npreventive medicine, for example? Or on precision medicine, for \\nexample? Or on investigators, for example?\\n    And what about oversight? We had an embarrassing thing \\nhappen in the NIH about its manufacturing of sterile drugs \\nrecently. If you are not accountable to us for what happens \\nthere, then you are not accountable to anybody, really. That is \\nour job as appropriators.\\n    So as a Republican, when I read Ben Bernanke's column that \\nsays that the Fed cannot create a growth economy, it takes \\neducation, capital formation, infrastructure, and research and \\ntechnology, I agree with that. I am all for more research. I \\nthink we should be doubling energy research, rather than \\nsubsidizing windmills and putting money in the pockets of rich \\ninvestors somewhere for after 22 or 23 years.\\n    I think we should be setting priorities. My priorities do \\ninclude your work and Dr. Moniz's work. But I would like you to \\nthink about the questions I asked about that type of funding \\nand maybe one of these days we will have a chance to talk about \\nit.\\n    Dr. Collins. I will certainly do so.\\n    Senator Blunt. Thank you, Senator.\\n    Senator Merkley.\\n\\n                          YOUNG INVESTIGATORS\\n\\n    Senator Merkley. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\n    And thank you, Dr. Collins, and your team, for the vision. \\nThe video of the T cells destroying the cancer cells is \\ninspiring. I think we're all thinking that we hope that over \\nthe years ahead every possible type of receptor on every \\npossible type of cancer cell and the ability to program T cells \\nto attack them will continue to develop. I think that is the \\nvision that we are anticipating.\\n    One of the concerns that I have heard often, and Oregon \\nHealth Sciences University is a major research partner with \\nNIH, a lot of grant funding goes there, is the stranding of \\nyoung researchers.\\n    Dr. Rodgers, I believe you mentioned the young \\ninvestigators, folks who are partway into their career. They \\nhave gone through their postgraduate work. They are in a \\nlaboratory, and then the grants don't come through, and then \\nthey have this incredible specialty about some form of nerve \\ncommunication or chemistry deep within the cell that may be the \\nkey, but who knows. But suddenly they are going, ``Well, what \\ndo I do now?''\\n    Does this continue to be a problem? And to what degree \\nshould we be deeply concerned about this loss? We spend a huge \\namount of resources to develop that talent and then suddenly \\nits ability to be applied is cut short.\\n    Dr. Collins. Well, I think we should be deeply concerned. \\nWe do put a great deal of resources into the training of this \\ngeneration of young scientists. The talents and skills that \\nthey possess are incredibly impressive.\\n    And yet, if you, as I often do, go and visit universities \\nacross this country and meet with graduate students, \\npostdoctoral fellows, it used to be when I made those visits, \\nthey wanted to tell me about the science they are doing. Now \\nthey want to tell me about their anxiety about whether there is \\na career path for them or not, or whether they ought to think \\nabout doing something else. And some of them have decided to do \\nother things or have gone to other countries where, in fact, \\nthe support for biomedical research is continuing to grow even \\nas ours has been shrinking.\\n    Every Institute at NIH thinks about this, worries about \\nthis. We sit around tables together and try to figure out \\nstrategies.\\n    Maybe I will ask Dr. Lorsch, because his Institute is \\ndeeply engaged in our training programs, to say something about \\nsome of the ideas we are pursuing, although I will tell you \\nthere is no magic here without seeing some relief from the \\nbudget squeeze in terms of what we can do. We can try to make \\nevery dollar count.\\n    Senator Merkley. Thank you. I would ask you, Dr. Lorsch, to \\nbe very brief because I have two more questions I want to get \\nto.\\n    Dr. Lorsch. Sure, I will be very quick. We are starting a \\nnew pilot program to explore a new grant mechanism. There will \\nbe a single grant per researcher that would actually address \\nsome of Senator Alexander's issues about administrative burden, \\nbut it would also be more stable for the investigators because \\nit would be a single grant. As Dr. Rodgers alluded to, this \\nwould help carry them through that sort of valley of death \\nafter their first grant when the second grant renewal is very \\nhard. That is something which has our main focuse.\\n    Senator Merkley. Thank you.\\n\\n                               SEQUENCING\\n\\n    I want to go back to where it started in terms of the \\nreceptors and the T cells. Earlier in the DNA world that you \\nwere centrally positioned in, it took an enormous amount of \\ntime to do sequencing. Now that is probably, I don't know, 1/\\n10,000 of the time? I am not sure what the factor is, but it is \\njust a very tiny fraction.\\n    Do you see a similar curve in terms of the time and effort \\nit takes to identify T receptors and be able to produce T cells \\nin a way that can attack specific cancers?\\n    Dr. Collins. Yes. It was 13 years for the first human \\ngenome. You can now get yours sequenced in a day or a little \\nless, so whatever that factor is.\\n    In terms of looking at proteins, of course they are encoded \\nby genes, so we have a connection there, where we can take full \\nadvantage of what we have learned all through the last several \\ndecades of recombinant DNA. So we have a pretty good sense of \\nwhat in fact are the proteins that are on the surface of \\nvarious cells, including cancer cells.\\n    The trick is that every cancer is a little different. This \\nis where precision medicine part of this fits in. That is very \\nmuch, I think, at the cutting edge of trying to bring \\nimmunology, genetics, genomics, and cancer biology together to \\nfigure out how to make that strategy work not in a one-size-\\nfits-all, because it probably won't work that way, but in a \\nprecision, individualized way.\\n\\n                              E-CIGARETTES\\n\\n    Senator Merkley. Shifting topics completely in the last 30 \\nseconds here, e-cigarettes, we have seen a tremendous growth. \\nThere have been studies that NIH has funded about the high \\nschool students tripling their use in a single year, and so \\nforth.\\n    What do you see as the role of NIH in terms of this new \\nform of tobacco and tobacco addiction?\\n    Dr. Lowy. Thank you, Senator. The NIH is concerned about \\ntobacco consumption because it has such an impact on disease. \\nAnd in addition, the issue of e-cigarettes where we do not know \\nwhat either the short-term or long-term impact is from the \\ncigarettes themselves, nor do we know what the implications are \\nfor behavior. Therefore, the NIH, in conjunction with the FDA, \\nis conducting research to investigate these critically \\nimportant areas.\\n    Senator Merkley. Thank you very much.\\n    Senator Blunt. Thank you, Senator.\\n    Senator Cassidy.\\n\\n                           FUNDING DECISIONS\\n\\n    Senator Cassidy. Hey, doctors, thank you all so much. As a \\npracticing physician sometimes still, I am so aware of your \\ngood work. I think we should double your budget, because I \\nunderstand the impact that would have upon my patients, among \\nwhich, when I did my residency in 1983 in Los Angeles, the \\nepicenter of HIV, at least the Western epicenter, I am very \\naware what was formerly a death sentence is now something you \\nlive with.\\n    Let me ask, because, Dr. Collins, you know that I have been \\nconcerned that 20 years ago I think it was GAO or IOM suggested \\nthat NIH rebalance its HIV spending from the 10 percent it had \\nbecome to diseases such as Alzheimer's and dementia, which are \\nmore important now.\\n    If you receive the 7 percent increase that the chair and \\nthe ranking member aspire for, we all do, will 10 percent of \\nthat budget continue to go, or roughly 9.5 percent, 10 percent, \\nof that, will that go to HIV research?\\n    Dr. Collins. Senator, you and I have discussed this on \\noccasion, and I think you are raising a good point about \\nwhether it makes sense to have a formula-driven way in which we \\ndefine how resources are to be spent, or should we focus that \\nentirely on what the public health needs are and what the \\nscientific opportunities are, the things that NIH usually does.\\n    No, I do not think that if we had the wonderful good \\nfortune to receive this kind of increase, that there ought to \\nbe a lockstep 10 percent formula-driven basis upon which we \\ndefine the HIV/AIDS research budget. I do think we should not \\ntake our foot off the accelerator at a time when HIV/AIDS is \\npoised I think for some major advances, including the potential \\ndevelopment of a vaccine. So I think we should step away from \\nthe formula.\\n    Senator Cassidy. And I do not mean to interrupt. I just \\nhave such limited time.\\n    Dr. Collins. Sure.\\n    Senator Cassidy. In your directive, I do not have it in \\nfront of me, but you mentioned among the focal points in terms \\nof the HIV research would be an emphasis upon comorbidities.\\n    Dr. Collins. Yes.\\n    Senator Cassidy. Now when we hear from Merkley and Blunt \\nand others about young researchers not having dollars, this is \\na concern to me. We pulled the minutes from the 2013 National \\nInstitute of Heart, Lung, Blood. They are speaking about how \\nthe success rate of non-AIDS applications are 18 percent, but \\nfor AIDS applications, they are 42 percent, meaning that it \\ntook a less quality project to be approved. And they hope to \\nencourage more submissions of AIDS projects and hope to \\nunderstand the barriers to submission.\\n    Then I see the project currently being done is looking at \\nthe cardiovascular comorbidities in HIV, along the lines of \\nthat which have proposed. And yet then we find out--I think we \\nfound out that of the 610,000 people who die every year from \\nheart disease, only roughly 1,800 of them have HIV as a \\ndeterminative cause.\\n    But nonetheless the money we're spending on this study is \\n21 percent of the budget of the National Heart, Lung, Blood \\nInstitute. So we're spending 21 percent of a budget for 0.29 \\npercent of those who die from HIV.\\n    Now if we are going to focus on comorbidities, spending 21 \\npercent of the institute's budget on the 0.29 percent who \\nhappened to be co-infected with HIV, it seems like we're going \\nin the wrong direction.\\n    Thoughts?\\n    Dr. Collins. So, I am not totally familiar with the \\ndetailed numbers you present, but I will certainly look at \\nthose.\\n    Certainly, we are in the process, Senator, of trying to \\nright-size the way in which our HIV research budget is being \\nallocated. The Office of AIDS Research has the potential to \\nmove dollars around between Institutes and between programs.\\n    Senator Cassidy. But can we move it out of HIV? For \\nexample, I have a study here. There has been $1 million that \\nhas gone to study behavior of Chinese men having sex with men \\nin some city in China, $1 million over the last 4 years. It \\nwould have been great to put that to Alzheimer's or to Oregon, \\nwhere Merkley's researcher would find--one of your predecessors \\nsaid that we are not the international institute of health, we \\nare the national institute of health.\\n    Why are we spending 1 million bucks on a behavioral health \\nstudy in China?\\n    Dr. Collins. Again, we have now identified I think the four \\nareas of high priority. Frankly, I do not think that that study \\nwould necessarily fit those priorities.\\n    Senator Cassidy. So I guess my question, you mentioned the \\nOffice of AIDS Research moving dollars between Institutes. But \\nif this is the kind of study--if at NHLBI, its 42 percent \\napproval rate for the HIV/AIDS study, frankly, they are getting \\ntoo much money for HIV/AIDS. They are having to find people to \\napply for something which is 21 percent of their budget.\\n    Can we move money out of that area into neurodegenerative \\ndiseases, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS?\\n    Dr. Collins. I certainly agree with you that we should be \\nmaking decisions across NIH on the basis of public health \\nneeds, scientific priority. I would say there are scientific \\npriorities emerging in HIV/AIDS that I would not want to see \\nneglected, particularly the opportunity to end this epidemic, \\nand particularly the investment in the vaccine, which is likely \\nto be quite expensive.\\n    So taking your point, I do not think we should in the \\nprocess of rethinking this portfolio, which we are doing \\nactually quite actively right now, we should not neglect the \\npotential of actually investing in different ways in HIV/AIDS \\nthat will bring an end to this epidemic.\\n    Senator Cassidy. There is something else I have read, and I \\nwill close with this, and I have read so much about this, I \\nlost this quote. But if you decide to focus exclusively on the \\ncure of one disease, inevitably, you end up ignoring other more \\npressing needs.\\n    We are spending $600 million right now on AIDS vaccine \\ndomestically, and I think $24 million on the international AIDS \\nvaccine initiative, not that we couldn't spend more, but to \\njustify 10 percent of the budget on the basis of that seems as \\nif we will end up neglecting Alzheimer's, dementia, mental \\nhealth, addiction, et cetera.\\n    I yield back.\\n    Senator Blunt. Thank you, Senator.\\n    Just for the record, Dr. Collins, you may have mentioned, \\nbut I don't know that I heard it, if you did, the four target \\nareas in HIV/AIDS research, when did you announce that? That \\nwas a recent reevaluation of where you are headed and a recent \\nannouncement?\\n    Dr. Collins. It was in August, Senator. I can quickly say \\nthose four priorities: reducing the incidence of HIV/AIDS; \\nresearch towards a cure for those who are infected who \\notherwise are doomed to lifelong treatment; a next-generation \\nof therapies with better adherence and fewer side effects; and \\nthese HIV-associated comorbidities, recognizing there are many, \\nmany thousands of people already infected who are having some \\nof those comorbidities. We need to understand them better.\\n    Senator Blunt. Thank you.\\n    Senator Capito.\\n\\n                              IDEA PROGRAM\\n\\n    Senator Capito: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    I thank all of you on the panel.\\n    I would like to thank Dr. Lorsch for coming and spending \\ntime in West Virginia at West Virginia University, talking \\nabout a program that I learned so much about, the IDeA Program, \\nwhich is a smart, successful program. So I thank you for that. \\nThere is research with stroke and brain, and also a \\ncollaborative effort with other universities, Marshall \\nUniversity, West Liberty, and Wheeling Jesuit. So I thank you \\nfor that.\\n    I wanted to give you a chance to say if you had any \\ntakeaways from the visit there that you might be able to \\naddress.\\n    Dr. Lorsch. I want to thank you again, Senator. It was a \\nfantastic visit that really energized my staff and myself.\\n    One thing we noticed consistently about the IDeA Program is \\nthat it is full of best practices. I think we really saw two \\nthere.\\n    The first, as you mentioned, was sharing resources to \\ncreate economies of scale, particularly in access to \\ntechnologies, which we saw was very critical, especially for \\nthe young researchers. I think that model of creating economies \\nof scale through sharing technology resources is something we \\nshould think about moving nationally because it can really get \\nthe taxpayers more science done for their money.\\n    The other area is training young investigators. We saw how \\nthe COBRE program, the Centers of Biomedical Research \\nExcellence, focuses on training young investigators. There was \\nrecently a paper, just last week, published by a group in \\nNevada, showing that investigators who participated in the \\nCOBRE centers were three times more likely to succeed than \\ninvestigators who did not participate in the COBRE centers, a \\nmatched set of investigators in terms of getting R01 grants and \\npublishing papers.\\n    Again, I think given the importance of young investigators, \\ntaking that model from the IDeA Program and thinking about how \\nwe can use it nationally is really important. I certainly give \\nSenator Cochran a lot of credit for developing the IDeA Program \\nin the first place.\\n    So thank you again.\\n\\n                      DIVERSITY IN CLINICAL TRIALS\\n\\n    Senator Capito. I think the enthusiasm we saw with the \\nyoung investigators, the young researchers, is something that \\nwas very inspiring for me. I have heard a lot about the \\nproblems of them moving to the next steps, so hopefully we can \\ndetermine that.\\n    Dr. Koroshetz, the National Institute of Aging is partnered \\nwith the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the \\nAdministration of Community Living in an initiative to bring \\nmore older Americans into research programs. The program has \\nspecific focus on Alzheimer's patients.\\n    Both my parents recently passed away from Alzheimer's. Can \\nyou talk to somebody like me who is 60 years old? How do you \\nget into these programs? How expansive are they? What are your \\nexpectations?\\n    And, actually, I went to an Alzheimer's meeting just the \\nother day, and they were talking about the push for diversity \\nin your research, where you are researching minorities and \\nother ethnic groups, women, men, because it manifests itself \\ndifferently, possibly in different types of groups, so that is \\na big question for a little bit of time.\\n    Dr. Koroshetz. Sure. Well, the National Institute of \\nNeurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Institute on \\nAging, which is the point institute for Alzheimer's disease at \\nNIH, are really working very hard on Alzheimer's projects.\\n    I think, as you mentioned, one of the stumbling blocks is \\nthe culture of research in this country. So as we develop new \\ntherapies, our barrier is really the number of people that we \\ncan enroll in studies. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's \\nDisease has a number of milestones, which are trying to really \\nexpand to increase enrollment.\\n    So in cancer, for instance, a large percentage of patients \\nwith cancer will enroll into a trial. For neurological \\ndisorders, it is much lower. So we really need to push on that. \\nI think we have some really good plans to do that.\\n\\n                        PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE\\n\\n    Senator Capito. I would like to help you with that, because \\nI think also it goes undiagnosed or it's, ``Well, they are \\ngetting old, and that is just sort of the way it is.'' I am \\nreally excited to hear about what you talked about with the \\npossibility of a vaccination or vaccine or something.\\n    Quickly, Dr. Volkow, I am from Appalachia, West Virginia. \\nWe have a very high incidence of prescription drug abuse and \\nnow heroin just on an astronomical rise, overdoses and deaths \\nresulting from the use of heroin.\\n    I am glad to see that you wrote in the Huffington Post, \\nwhich is something I don't read very often, I will admit, to \\nembrace the concept of addiction as a chronic disease. I think \\nwe are all with you there. I do not think one of us probably \\nhas been untouched by this.\\n    Rural America is really suffering from this. Some of the \\nsmaller States, lower socioeconomics, they are going to heroin, \\nand in other high unemployment areas.\\n    Where do you see your role here?\\n    Dr. Volkow. The urgency and the tragedy of what is going on \\naround the country, and in the Appalachia region, has made this \\none of our priority initiatives. It is also one of the priority \\ninitiatives for HHS.\\n    So we have been working with our sister agencies or brother \\nagencies to actually integrate our projects to maximize the \\nlikelihood of success. So HHS has three items, one of them is \\nbetter prescription practices for the proper management of \\npain. NIDA, for example, is very invested in developing \\nalternative therapy treatments for the management of pain \\nbecause we are very restricted by what we currently have, which \\nhas resulted in the overreliance on opiates, item number one.\\n    Item number two, greater access to naloxone, which \\nbasically is a medication that overturns----\\n    Senator Capito. Right, that was just legalized in our \\nState.\\n    Dr. Volkow. Which is wonderful.\\n    So we are partnering with pharmaceuticals to develop \\nalternative ways of administering naloxone that do not require \\nan injection, so anyone can administer it.\\n    The third one is deploying medication-assisted therapies \\nthat actually have been shown to prevent overdoses and prevent \\nHIV infections. So we are developing alternative medications \\nthat can increase compliance, so we are already doing that.\\n    What we want to do is to partner with CDC in order to \\ndevelop a project that can target the Appalachian region. I \\nvisited the place, and I was struck by how minimal the \\ninfrastructure there was in some of these towns. So the issue \\nis how does one address this? We have tools. How do we deploy \\nthem?\\n    Senator Capito. Right. Thank you.\\n    Thank you very much.\\n    Senator Blunt. Senator Moran.\\n\\n                      ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH FUNDING\\n\\n    Senator Moran. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.\\n    Dr. Collins and crew, welcome. Thank you for the \\nopportunity to have a conversation today.\\n    Dr. Collins, NIH recently released its professional \\njudgment budget for Alzheimer's. Am I correct in assuming that \\nthe President's budget request was the starting point, that you \\nare going to build upon the President's request? Is that true?\\n    Dr. Collins. That's true. We were building for fiscal year \\n2017 what a professional judgment would look like, assuming \\nthat the President's budget was the fiscal year 2016 number.\\n    Senator Moran. I want to give you the chance to tell us, if \\nwe are successful in accomplishing what this Committee did in \\nregard to increases in funding over the President's request, \\nwould it give us a greater opportunity to advance the success, \\nthe research necessary to address the issues of Alzheimer's?\\n    Dr. Collins. Yes, Senator, it would. Because of some of the \\nthings we imagined that we would fund in fiscal year 2017 \\ncould, in fact, be started earlier in 2016, so we would want to \\nrevise the number for the fiscal year 2017 professional \\njudgment budget on that basis.\\n    Senator Moran. So Senator Blunt's subcommittee and the \\ninclusion of a $2 billion increase at NIH, plus the specific \\nissues related to brain and Alzheimer's, would have a \\nsignificant consequence on the ability to advance the cause, \\nelimination, cure, treatment?\\n    Dr. Collins. I think we are not limited at the present time \\nby ideas or talent. We are limited by resources. Certainly, if \\nit were possible to have more resources in 2016, we could start \\nprojects that would otherwise have to wait longer. So, yes, we \\ncould go faster.\\n    Senator Moran. Of course, Dr. Collins, I think you are a \\nvery bright, intelligent person, but I have discovered that you \\nalso have the ability to say the same thing more than once. \\nPerhaps you should be a Senator. Dr. Koroshetz.\\n    Dr. Koroshetz. I would just say, to go with what Francis \\nsaid, for the Alzheimer's plan and for the BRAIN Initiative as \\nwell, we have serial projects in which one depends on the \\nother, and we do not know what fiscal year 2016 will do, but we \\nare ready to go. We have announcements ready but we will not be \\nable to fund them unless additional money does come.\\n    Senator Moran. So, let me make sure I understand that. You \\nare prepared to expend the dollars that are included in the \\nSenate Appropriations Committee recommendations, our \\nappropriation bill?\\n    Dr. Koroshetz. We are shovel ready.\\n    Senator Moran. Good to hear.\\n    The Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit occurred last \\nFebruary. NIH is poised to revise the research milestones that \\nit created in that national plan. When can we expect that?\\n    Dr. Koroshetz. So, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's \\nDisease is actually a community plan that was developed with \\nconsultation from the scientific community, advocacy community, \\npatient community, and the caregiver community. NIH conducts \\nregular revisits to the search recommendations and milestone \\nreferenced in the plan, so it is revised on a regular timeline. \\nWe alternate between NINDS, which covers Alzheimer's disease-\\nrelated dementias (like vascular disease that causes dementia, \\nParkinson's disease that causes dementia) and the NIA, which \\nleads the Alzheimer's focused research milestones.\\n    So, on a regular basis, we are alternating between those \\ntwo areas and revising the milestones.\\n    Senator Moran. Thank you very much.\\n    Dr. Collins, in the budget hearing back in April, you and I \\nhad a conversation in which you testified something along these \\nlines, ``To achieve our mission, we must serve as effective and \\nefficient stewards of the resources we have been given by the \\nAmerican public.'' This is continuing to quote you, ``To \\nsupport this focus on priority-setting, we are developing an \\noverarching NIH strategic plan, and will be linking this with \\nindividual Institutes and Centers strategic plans that reflect \\nthe rapid current progress in bioscience.''\\n    My question is, what are the details? Fill in the spaces \\nabout what has transpired since that conversation occurred. \\nWhat are you doing that is new and that will mean that we are \\ngoing forward, and we have latest opportunities because of that \\nefficiency to achieve more?\\n    Dr. Collins. Well, we are working very hard on developing \\nthe strategic plan that you mention. We are scheduled to \\ndeliver that to Congress in mid-December. It does try to lay \\nout in a clear fashion across all of NIH how it is that we set \\npriorities; how we make decisions about where the dollars are \\nmost efficiently spent; and also how we are being good stewards \\nin terms of how the process of peer review and council review \\nand director actions on what we fund is carried out, as well as \\na number of other efficiencies that we are concerned about, \\nincluding what Senator Alexander was discussing earlier, just \\nin terms of the burden that is applied to investigators who are \\ntrying to get the research done, as well as human subjects \\noversight and so on.\\n    There will be a lot in this document that will lay out, I \\nthink, in greater detail than has been possible before how we \\nintend to use all the dollars we have for the best benefit.\\n    Senator Moran. Mr. Chairman, Dr. Collins, let me repeat \\nmyself. I have offered this admonition, if that is a safe thing \\nto say, that we are often told as Members of Congress that we \\ndo not want to be meddling in the ``politics of deciding where \\nresearch dollars should be spent.'' I share that view, but it \\nmeans it is incumbent on NIH to make the decisions that are \\nnecessary as to where the dollars spent are the most likely to \\nachieve the quickest, the fastest, the best, the necessary \\nresults.\\n    Dr. Collins. And I welcome that responsibility, as do all \\nof my colleagues.\\n    Senator Moran. And I apologize if I offended you for \\nsuggesting that you could serve in the United States Senate.\\n    Senator Blunt. There might have been a time when that would \\nbe considered a compliment, but it probably would not be right \\nnow.\\n    We do have time for a second round of questions. We will \\nstart with Senator Murray.\\n\\n                       PREVENTING TYPE 2 DIABETES\\n\\n    Senator Murray. Thank you very much.\\n    Dr. Rodgers, I wanted to go back to you. You spoke earlier \\nabout the 29 million Americans who have diabetes, and the 86 \\nmillion who are prediabetic. That sounds to me like we have a \\ncrisis on our hands, as the number of Americans with that \\ndisease continues to grow.\\n    You mentioned the work your Institute has done on \\nprevention programs that incorporate regular exercise and \\nreduce fat intake and the huge difference it makes. The CDC's \\nchronic disease program, which our bill has regrettably been \\nforced to cut, helped fund programs like one in my home State \\nthat supported community health efforts through the YMCA and \\nsome other local organizations that promote healthier living.\\n    What might taking that preventative program to scale mean \\nfor this country's diabetic epidemic?\\n    Dr. Rodgers. Thank you, Senator, for that question.\\n    The YMCA that you are referring to, was able to develop \\nwhat we did in the clinical trial for the Diabetes Prevention \\nProgram, which is a lifestyle intervention on an individual \\nbasis, scale it up by doing the same lifestyle intervention but \\nproviding it in a group setting. In fact, their results after \\nthe first year or 2 were quite similar to what we achieved in \\nthe individual program, in terms of weight loss, et cetera.\\n    But more interestingly, the costs for patients involved in \\nthis clinical trial with the initial instruction and the \\nfollow-up was about $6,000 per patient. In the group setting in \\nthe YMCA, the cost was cut down to about $400.\\n    In terms of scaling this, for example, if we could expand \\nthis, we have not done any economic analysis on this, but there \\nis a private group called the Urban Institute that has recently \\nlooked at what happens if you could scale this. They estimate, \\ngiven those numbers, about $191 billion could be saved over a \\n10-year period, with some very conservative assessments or \\nassumptions, if this could go to scale.\\n\\n                            CANCER RESEARCH\\n\\n    Senator Murray. Well, that is impressive.\\n    Dr. Lowy, let me ask you, as Dr. Collins mentioned, we have \\nseen some significant progress in recent years in the use of \\nimmunotherapy to treat certain forms of melanoma lymphoma and \\nlung cancer. I believe there is universal support on the \\nsubcommittee for efforts to find similar breakthroughs for \\nother cancers. I want to ask you, what is NCI doing to make \\nthat happen? And where is the potential for new cures the \\ngreatest?\\n    Dr. Lowy. We are investing in a number of different areas \\nthroughout the cancer spectrum. I think that there are \\nopportunities in many different areas.\\n    For example, we are investing heavily in pancreatic cancer, \\nbecause this is a cancer where we have not had significant \\nprogress despite long-term recognition of how serious this \\ncancer is.\\n    We also are investing research in pediatric interventions, \\nand recently NCI supported researchers have develop two new \\ninterventions against pediatric leukemia and lymphoma. And this \\nwas initially developed in the academic sector and has been \\npicked up by venture capital, and is rapidly going forward for \\nclinical trials.\\n    We also are interacting with the pharmaceutical industry to \\ntry to identify new and important uses for drugs that are off-\\nthe-shelf, either because they have been approved for one \\nintervention but not for another. For example, BRAF inhibitors \\nin melanoma, trying them in other diseases. This is potentially \\na very important innovation, because we recognize that a \\npercentage of patients who have different kinds of cancers may \\nactually have the same molecular abnormalities and, therefore, \\nmay benefit from targeted treatments initially developed in \\nother areas.\\n    I could go on but I think that given the time----\\n    Senator Murray. Could you just tell me why immunotherapy is \\neffective in some patients but not in others who have the same \\ncancer?\\n    Dr. Lowy. Yes. I think that this is a critically important \\nissue. I think what we are doing to support research to \\nunderstand mechanisms is critically important because if we \\ncould understand why some patients are benefiting, whereas \\nothers are not, that increased understanding should lead to \\nbetter interventions for the people who currently are not \\nresponding. Or at the very least, we would not be giving them \\ntreatment for which they are not going to benefit.\\n    Senator Murray. So it is a question we need to answer with \\nmore research.\\n    Dr. Lowy. Yes.\\n    Senator Murray. Okay, thank you very much.\\n    Senator Blunt. I will go last in this second round, so, \\nSenator Shelby.\\n\\n                        REPLICATION OF RESEARCH\\n\\n    Senator Shelby. I will be as fast as I can. Thank you, Mr. \\nChairman.\\n    Dr. Collins, there have been several articles regarding \\nbiomedical study results, including those funded by NIH, that \\nappear in top peer-reviewed journals that cannot be replicated \\nor reproduced. One of the articles cited a Bayer study \\ndescribing how it had halted 64 percent of its early drug \\ntarget projects because in-house experiments failed to match \\nclaims made in the publication.\\n    You have done a study on this. What is the problem here? \\nWhy can't they replicate? Is it rushing to print too fast? What \\nis it? Would you discuss that?\\n    Dr. Collins. Senator, it was you who first brought this \\nissue to attention in a hearing about 3 years ago as it was \\njust beginning to appear. I appreciate very much your having \\nshined a light on a situation that we are taking with great \\nseriousness.\\n    This is a complicated, multi-factored situation. I am \\nactually showing up on the screen what NIH has now posted as \\nfar as a summary of all the things we are engaged in to try to \\naddress this, and also to do things to improve the training of \\nthe next generation of scientists about these issues, in terms \\nof rigor and reproducibility.\\n    I would say, of the factors that are involved, certainly \\nthe hypercompetitive atmosphere that currently exists, much of \\nit on the basis of the fact that funding is so tight, causes \\npeople to try to get publications out as quickly as possible. \\nThat may, in fact, result in circumstances where the \\nreplication study didn't quite get done. And therefore, \\nsomebody else finds out later it would not have worked.\\n    We have an issue in terms of journals also, in many \\ninstances, not having been as thorough as they should in \\nevaluating manuscripts.\\n    I am happy to say that through the leadership of Dr. \\nLawrence Tabak, the principal deputy, we convened the journals \\nto talk about this. Now more than 150 journals have signed off \\non a checklist that they use when papers come in to be sure \\nthat the experimental details are there, the statistical \\nmethods are described, and so on.\\n    It clearly is something, though, that touches many areas of \\nscience. Dr. Lorsch has been leading an effort where we are \\nlooking at projects on cell lines, because sometimes people \\npublish a paper about work on a cell line and it turns out that \\ncell line was not what they thought it was. These things get \\npassed around.\\n    Training is critical. We actually have some training videos \\nup on the site, if you want to see what we are now asking \\nmentors to use in lab meetings and other group meetings, to try \\nto bring to the attention of trainees these critical issues \\nabout study design, how you set up an experiment where you know \\nthat you have done it rigorously.\\n    So we are all over this, and we are, in fact, pushing \\npretty hard to see this problem addressed.\\n    It will always be the case that science gives you results \\nthat, later on, you cannot seem to make sense out of. But if \\nthat happens, we want it to happen in a way that was \\nunavoidable, not because people were actually cutting corners.\\n    I think we have the whole attention of the community now to \\nthis, and you are going to see the problem get less than it had \\nbeen. I hope much less.\\n    Senator Shelby. But this is a very important question, \\nbecause it goes right to the essence of the investigation and \\nreplicating what you have found or discovered and what we \\nbenefit from. Is that correct?\\n    Doctor, do you want to comment on that?\\n    Dr. Koroshetz. Yes, I was going to add one other point. We \\nhave looked at this at our Institute, and there is another side \\nto this, which is that for some of these things, it is not that \\nyou can't reproduce them. It is that given the effort that you \\nput in, you didn't reproduce them.\\n    So we have, for instance, really interesting technologies. \\nWhen you first try to reproduce it, you can't do it. But when \\nthe people who develop the technologies open up their labs, \\npeople can go in and learn how to do it, and then it works.\\n    Senator Shelby. So some of them were on the right road, but \\nthey just did not have the means to finish it?\\n    Dr. Koroshetz. That's right.\\n    Senator Shelby. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Blunt. Thank you, Senator.\\n    Let's go to Senator Cassidy and then Senator Moran.\\n\\n                       BASIC SCIENCE OF ADDICTION\\n\\n    Senator Cassidy. First, I misspoke last time. $66 million \\nis not 21 percent of the NHLBI. That was too much. But \\nnonetheless, the point is taken. The best we can find out, it \\nis about 1,800 people who die of HIV with cardiovascular \\ndisease. We are spending $66 million on it.\\n    Dr. Volkow, I heard people say that the basic science of \\naddiction and mental health is a barren field. I am not a \\nmental health professional nor an addictionologist. But I am \\njust asking, do you feel as if you had, to take the question \\nasked earlier, significant more resources, would you be able to \\ndo the clinical and basic science to make significant advances \\nin the area of addictionology? And could you speak to that for \\nmental health as well?\\n    Dr. Volkow. Yes. Definitely, we could accelerate a lot of \\nthe discoveries. And I apologize, Senator, but I am going to \\ndisagree, because I would not say the research on mental health \\nand substance abuse disorders has been barren as it relates to \\nover the past 10 years, 15 years, a really expanded \\nunderstanding about the abnormalities in the brain of people \\nwho suffer from mental illness.\\n    Senator Cassidy. I accept that. Actually, I did not know \\nenough to disagree, but you would say there is great academic \\nprogress?\\n    Dr. Volkow. There has been great academic progress, and \\nthat has enabled us to identify potential targets for \\ntreatment.\\n    But there is a problem going----\\n    Senator Cassidy. Can I stop you?\\n    Dr. Volkow. Yes.\\n\\n                   FUNDING NEURODEGENERATIVE RESEARCH\\n\\n    Senator Cassidy. Dr. Koroshetz, again, the issue on \\nAlzheimer's dementia and ALS and Parkinson's, I heard people \\nsay the promise is not there as it might be in other fields.\\n    I also have parents with dementia and Alzheimer's. I want \\nto give you a lot of money. I am hoping to convince my \\ncolleagues who have more sway--that is where they go ahead of \\nme, they have more sway than me--to do so as well. Would that \\nbe a worthy investment? Is there academic promise in those \\nfields, that if you got the money, you can do the basic \\nresearch, clinical research, et cetera?\\n    Dr. Koroshetz. I think the neurodegeneration field, in \\ngeneral, is bringing in lots of really smart people to try to \\nsolve these problems. So we have the workforce. I think with \\nthe resources, we could really make hay.\\n    As I said before, there are a couple things that are really \\ntantalizing now, and that is that all the neurodegenerative \\ndiseases--Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS--all have one common \\nfeature. The cells that die have proteins that aggregate and \\nget stuck in those cells.\\n    So, people really are on the idea that maybe there is a \\nunified theory. If we can stop this process for one disease, we \\ncan stop it for all of them.\\n    So, it is a leap of faith right now, but there is evidence \\nthat this is not impossible, that we can make a big \\nbreakthrough.\\n    Senator Cassidy. Dr. Collins.\\n    Dr. Collins. I would just like to add to that----\\n    Senator Cassidy. I have a question for you, Dr. Collins.\\n    Dr. Collins. Okay, this will be quick. Just basically, the \\npoint here is that you are never quite sure where the \\nbreakthroughs are going to come from. We have to be careful not \\nto overly target research plans in a direction of a specific \\ndisease because the answer might come out of some very \\ndifferent investigation or some very basic science, as we are \\ncelebrating today with the Nobel Prizes.\\n    Just a quick example, the biggest breakthrough that I have \\nheard about in the last month for ALS----\\n\\n                            DECISION MAKING\\n\\n    Senator Cassidy. No, can I just stop you? I have a minute \\nand 45 seconds. Can I stop you for a second?\\n    You have a bunch of bright, aggressive people who they \\nwould not be who they are were it not for you being the \\npinnacle. Believe me, I am a doc. I know you are the pinnacle \\nof the docs.\\n    You mentioned earlier the academic promise, the research \\npromise, of HIV/AIDS as a rationale to somewhat continue there. \\nI guess what I was trying to figure out is, is it lacking \\nelsewhere? One of the excuses--or one of the reasons, I should \\nsay, to continue the funding in one area as opposed to others \\nis the apparent academic promise in the one as opposed to the \\nothers.\\n    How do you balance each of these folks who have such \\npromise in their field as you make that decision?\\n    Dr. Collins. That is a great question. That is something we \\ntalk about every day around the table.\\n    Certainly, in every one of these Institutes, there are \\nareas that are up-and-coming and others that perhaps are not \\nquite as rapidly moving. We are constantly trying to adjust the \\ndecisionmaking, but also not trying to be overly top-down in \\nmaking decisions because a lot of the great ideas come from our \\nwonderful scientific community out there, and we cannot always \\nanticipate where they are going. So it is a constant revision \\nday by day, week by week, of where we want to put the emphasis.\\n    Senator Cassidy. Okay.\\n    And if my wish were fulfilled and dollars were redirected \\nfrom HIV/AIDS into some of these other areas, it sounds like \\nthere are fertile fields that that money would, indeed, \\nfertilize and hopefully sow great benefits.\\n    Dr. Collins. There are fertile fields all across our \\nlandscape.\\n    Senator Cassidy. Okay, I yield back. Thank you.\\n    Senator Blunt. Senator Moran.\\n\\n                                  ALS\\n\\n    Senator Moran. Mr. Chairman, thank you.\\n    Dr. Collins, the most significant development that has \\noccurred in the last 30 days is? On ALS?\\n    Dr. Collins. Okay, thank you. It sort of fits with the \\nconversation we are having.\\n    It was an investigator who is actually studying HIV/AIDS \\nand trying to understand one of the comorbidities, which is a \\nneurological problem, which resembles ALS in a modest way. This \\nis an intramural investigator, Avi Nath.\\n    He discovered that there is an activation of an endogenous \\nretrovirus that we all carry around called HERV and that it \\nstarts making copies of itself and it causes this damage to the \\nneurological system, particularly those anterior horn cells. \\nThis looks very much like ALS. And in fact, the publication, \\nwhich just came out, suggested that this might be one of those \\nmissing clues to what is happening in Lou Gehrig's disease, not \\nfor people who have HIV at all, but who have similar symptoms.\\n    I don't know where that is going to go. Dr. Koroshetz \\nprobably could tell you a lot more about the details.\\n    But it was an interesting example where you are studying \\nthis disease over here, and you learn something about that one \\nover there, and you didn't expect that to happen.\\n    Senator Moran. Thank you.\\n\\n                    UPDATE ON PEDIATRIC MATCH TRIAL\\n\\n    Dr. Lowy, welcome to this panel. I look forward to getting \\nbetter acquainted with you. I just want to give you the \\nopportunity to express, as the relatively new Acting Director, \\nyour vision for the National Cancer Institute. I particularly \\nwanted to highlight a program that is being launched, a \\npediatric clinical trial called Pediatric MATCH trial, and can \\nyou tell me about that and where you see it going and what it \\nmay mean.\\n    Dr. Lowy. The Pediatric MATCH trial, Senator, is a trial \\nthat is currently under development. What it does is \\nessentially do for pediatric cancer research what the Adult \\nMATCH trial that started 2 months ago is doing for adults who \\nhave advanced cancer for which there is no standard treatment.\\n    It puts the molecular abnormality of the patient front and \\ncenter, rather than the origin in the body of where it occurs. \\nAnd it takes drugs that are off-the-shelf, either experimental \\ndrugs or that have been approved for other uses, and it tests \\nthem in these other ways for cancers where they are not yet \\napproved.\\n    The goal is to improve the outlook for these patients. This \\nis a trial that, as I said, is under development and one of the \\nuses for the Precision Medicine Initiative, the oncology \\nportion, that people have been talking about.\\n    Senator Moran. And your vision for NCI?\\n    Dr. Lowy. The overall vision for NCI is to support basic \\nresearch, as we have done historically, to invest in precision \\nmedicine, not just in the areas of cancer treatment, as is \\noccurring with the Precision Medicine Initiative and the \\noncology portion, but also to emphasize precision medicine in \\nthe area of cancer prevention and cancer screening, \\nunderstanding better the causes of cancer, understanding better \\nhow cancer comes about, and, in addition, to put a focus on \\nhealth disparities in cancer.\\n    Unfortunately, there are many different kinds of cancer \\nwhere certain underrepresented minorities have a much higher \\nincidence of mortality, and we need to treat these populations \\nas we would any high-risk population to understand the biology, \\nthe lifestyle factors, and the utilization of medical utility, \\nand, in addition, to try to mitigate these factors just as we \\ndo for any high-risk population.\\n    These are some of the important areas that we are looking \\nforward to making progress in.\\n    Senator Moran. Thank you very much. I wish you well.\\n    Mr. Chairman, thank you for this hearing. Thanks to you and \\nSenator Murray for your leadership in this area of medical \\nresearch.\\n\\n                    SUPPORT FOR INNOVATIVE RESEARCH\\n\\n    Senator Blunt. Well, thank you, Senator Moran.\\n    Dr. Lorsch, when Senator Moran was the ranking member on \\nthis Committee, they started an effort like the Defense \\nAdvanced Research Projects on high-risk. I think it was fiscal \\nyear 2014.\\n    You mentioned high risk, high reward, a couple times. Give \\na couple examples of either things that did work out, or things \\nthat did not that we should be thinking about when we think \\nabout going to a high-risk area as opposed to something that is \\nmore likely to produce a result, but maybe not nearly as big of \\na result.\\n    Dr. Lorsch. I think the recent developments in gene editing \\nare an example of something that was an out-of-the-box idea. \\nCould you use this bacterial system that allows rearrangements \\nof genes and then use it to edit genes in a mammalian cell to \\npossibly repair those genes in a diseased state? That is \\nsomething, as you may know, that has recently worked and has \\ntaken off and is revolutionizing biotechnology and has the \\npromise to revolutionize medicine in a variety of ways. I think \\nthat is a great example of that.\\n    Dr. Collins. I might mention that the Common Fund at NIH, \\nwhich the Congress made into a permanent part of our budget \\nback in 2006, is a place that specifically aims to try to \\nsupport these high-risk, high-reward projects that no single \\nInstitute would probably be able to invest in, but collectively \\nwe can.\\n    A couple examples there. The microbe biome, this effort to \\nunderstand how the microbes that live on us and in us that \\nactually outnumber us if you start counting up cells, how do \\nthose play a role in our health and in the cause of disease.\\n    This has been an absolutely revolutionary set of insights \\ncoming about because of new technologies that allow us to find \\nout what is there and how it changes over time. That was one of \\nthose high-risk, high-reward programs that has now changed the \\nwhole landscape of how all the institutes are doing research \\nbecause you really do not want to think of the human as an \\norganism now. You want to think of us as superorganisms. It is \\nboth us and the microbes, and it is the interaction between the \\ntwo that makes a big difference. That is an example.\\n    Another one, which is closer to clinical medicine, is to \\ntry to come up with a really standardized, reliable way of \\npatients reporting outcomes from their perspective. So much of \\nclinical research is the researchers or doctors saying here is \\nwhat we think happened to this patient who was given this \\ntreatment. You want to hear what the patient thought, too. \\nSometimes it is not quite the same thing.\\n    But we have not had those majors, so a program called \\nPromise, which many people thought this was going to be really \\nhard, has actually transformed that process. It makes it \\npossible now for us to run more clinical trials where the \\npatients are not really patients. They are partners. They are \\nfull participants. Their input is guiding our decisionmaking \\nabout what works and what doesn't.\\n    Senator Blunt. I think Washington University is doing some \\nof the microbial work.\\n    Dr. Collins. They are. Jeff Gordon, your heroic figure \\nthere at Wash. University is one of the main leaders in the \\nworld.\\n    Senator Blunt. And unlike the genetic structure, the \\nmicrobial structure is changing all the time and how you impact \\nthat is the question here. Is that right?\\n    Dr. Collins. That is right. And as we are now mounting this \\nPrecision Medicine Initiative, thinking about following 1 \\nmillion Americans over time, to know what is happening to their \\nmicrobe biome would be enormously interesting, as a consequence \\nof diet, exercise, the presence of illness or not, taking \\nantibiotics. We could find this out on a scale not previously \\nimaginable once we get this up and going.\\n    Senator Blunt. Right.\\n\\n                        OPIOID AND HERION ABUSE\\n\\n    I am going to come to you, Dr. Volkow. Senator Murray \\nmentioned earlier the cut to the block grant fund. In fact, we \\ncut lots of programs in this budget to begin to reorient the \\nbill towards other priorities. In fact, I think we eliminated \\ntotally funding for 43 programs that this year we are spending \\n$1.25 billion, all of which had very good titles. There was not \\na single title that was not meritorious.\\n    But the process of prioritizing is exactly that. You do not \\nreally prioritize if all you do is get more money and spend it \\non something more important than you thought you were spending \\non last year. That is not really prioritizing. That is just \\nadding more money on top for good things.\\n    But what brought me to that when I thought about, well, we \\ndid cut those block grants by about 3 percent. But the majority \\nof that money, in my view, went into increasing the money to \\ncombat opioid abuse, which, frankly, a handful of years ago I \\nhadn't heard of at all. But in Committee hearings this year, we \\nheard about it all the time.\\n    Would you talk a little bit about both opioid abuse and \\nwhat research may be going on to come up with pain medicines \\nthat are less easily abused, and less easily converted to other \\ndrugs to be used in other ways? That would be helpful.\\n    Dr. Volkow. Yes, indeed. Unfortunately, you are hearing \\nabout opioids because of their devastating consequences. So on \\nthe one hand, we have basically seen 16,000 people die from \\nprescription opioid overdoses. Over the past 6 years, we have \\nseen a fourfold increase in people dying from heroin. So it was \\nstable for many years, at around 2,000 deaths per year. And in \\nthe past 5 years, it has increased to over 8,000 deaths in \\n2013. So we are seeing a really steep increase in deaths from \\nprescription opioids and now from heroin.\\n    That has led us to realize the nature of the problem. So on \\nthe one hand, we have the reality that there are many patients \\nsuffering from chronic pain but we do not have sufficient \\nalternatives, as I was mentioning before.\\n    So in partnership with the pain consortia at NIH, NIDA is \\ntrying to develop alternative medications that are effective \\nfor severe pain that are not addictive. We are trying to also \\npartner with the pharmaceutical industry to develop opioid \\nmedications that will not be diverted.\\n    We are partnering, of course, with the funding agencies. \\nAnd the FDA recently approved some new indication that an \\nopioid medication cannot be diverted.\\n    We are also encouraging the better education of the \\nhealthcare providers on how to screen properly for pain and how \\nto manage opioids, and how to, of course, screen for substance \\nuse disorders.\\n    So there is a multipronged approach, both from the \\nperspective of NIH with various Institutes working together and \\nat the same time with our sister agencies.\\n    Senator Blunt. And I would think one of those groups may be \\nwhatever is happening in the Defense Department research on \\nthis topic because, certainly, servicemembers and veterans have \\na really high propensity to find themselves in that trap of \\nbecoming addicted to the pain medicines that they are given, \\noften because of their service-related injuries, and that \\ncannot be a good thing.\\n    Dr. Volkow. You are pointing at something that, \\nunfortunately, not many people are aware of. The prevalence of \\npain in military people returning is much higher. As a result \\nof that, they are much more likely to be given prescription \\nopioids, much higher than the rest of the public.\\n    Therefore, the number of people who are dying from \\nprescription opioids among the military is higher, just by the \\nfact of what you are saying. They are suffering from pain, and \\nwe do not have many pain alternatives, so they receive opioid \\nmedications.\\n    Senator Blunt. Well, thank you for your help on that.\\n    Senator Shaheen.\\n    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    I would like to follow up on the concerns that you are \\nraising about opioid abuse and also heroin, the fact that it \\nhas led to a heroin epidemic. That is a huge challenge that we \\nare facing in the Northeast and across this country.\\n    I can tell you that in my little town of Dover with a \\npopulation of about 20,000 people, they had two recent deaths \\njust in 1 day from drug overdoses. I think it should rise to \\nthe level of the kind of cross-agency--it is a crisis, and I \\nappreciate that you all have a different mission in terms of \\nresearch. But this is something that the medical community, the \\nlaw enforcement community, the treatment community, all need to \\nbe working on together. Until that happens, we are going to \\ncontinue to see this crisis escalate. It is already out of \\ncontrol, and it is only going to get worse.\\n    So when, in a small town in New Hampshire, you can buy a \\nbag of heroin for less than you can get your prescription \\nfilled for $7 a bag, then we have a real problem.\\n    So I want to make that point, because I am not sure if \\nthere are other ways in which you all are looking at addressing \\nthis issue, beyond just the challenge of opioids. And the \\nextent to which that gets people addicted, are there other \\nthings you are looking at with respect to the opioid and heroin \\nepidemic that is going on in the country right now? I am happy \\nto direct that to whoever would like to take it.\\n    Dr. Volkow. Yes, indeed. Again, it is a devastating \\nsituation, but one of the reinforcing things to me has been how \\nintegrated the agencies have been in working together to come \\nup with solutions and how these solutions are actually coming \\ninto very specific action items, like the FDA approving new \\nindication for deterrent formulations, like the DEA coming up \\nwith let's bring back all those opioid medications that are not \\nbeing used.\\n    These actually are resulting in effective interventions. So \\nthere is a very strong, concerted effort.\\n    The good news is that there are medications that we \\ncurrently have that are effective for the treatment of people \\nthat become addicted to those opioid prescriptions. The \\nchallenge is that they are not being implemented. So we are \\nworking with agencies to actually develop implementation \\nstrategies to increase it, to provide medications for the \\npatients that would be easier to take so that they are \\ncompliant.\\n\\n                             USE OF NARCAN\\n\\n    Senator Shaheen. Right. Sorry to interrupt.\\n    So does NIH have a view on whether Narcan should be \\navailable over-the-counter to families, not to law enforcement \\nor other people who actually do interventions, but to families \\nwho are concerned about drug overdoses and their families? Is \\nthat something that you think should be readily available?\\n    Dr. Volkow. I think we are extremely lucky to have Narcan. \\nWe should make it as widely available as possible.\\n    Senator Shaheen. Thank you.\\n    I would just urge NIH to think about all of the ways in \\nwhich you can engage on this issue, because it is, as you know, \\nout of control and getting worse, not better, despite all of \\nthe coordinated efforts. We see those in New Hampshire and \\nother States that are dealing with this issue, but we still \\nhave not made it, I think, the kind of all-hands-on-deck \\npriority that it should be.\\n    Dr. Collins. I would just add to that, there is a lot of \\ninteragency work on this. There is interagency pain research \\ncoordinating committee that meets. It is all the Federal \\nagencies. I think they are doing very good work. We have \\neducation programs.\\n\\n               COORDINATION OF EFFORTS--STATE AND FEDERAL\\n\\n    Senator Shaheen. Can I just interrupt? So how are they \\ncoordinating the work that they are doing at the State level, \\nwith States that are dealing with this issue?\\n    Dr. Collins. I would have to get back to you on the State \\nlevel, because that is something that we have not really \\napproached. But there is a national pain strategy that we are \\nworking on through HHS to be cleared soon that addresses some \\nof these problems.\\n    There are education programs that NIH funds. One of the \\nissues is really educating the practitioners on the actual \\nproper use. So we have centers of excellence for education on \\nhow to manage pain that NIH funds. HHS has a tremendous video \\nfor education of practitioners on the use of narcotics and best \\nmanagement of pain, trying to reverse this problem.\\n    Senator Shaheen. Well, I do not know how we make sure that \\nStates are aware of the work that is going on, but, certainly, \\nthat seems to be one of the coordinating points that has to \\nhappen in order to better address the crisis. So I would urge \\nthat you all think about that, and if we can be helpful in \\nthinking about how to make sure that that kind of information \\nand effort is available.\\n    Dr. Collins. I would just add quickly, Congressman Hal \\nRogers, who has been such an effective leader in terms of \\nbringing attention to this, runs a summit every April and \\nbrings in the States. And Dr. Volkow and I have been at that \\nsummit each time for the last couple years. Tom Frieden, head \\nof the CDC, comes.\\n    It is an opportunity for States to really hear what the \\nopportunities are that are being thought about across the \\nNation. It is probably not enough because, as you say, we are \\nstill in the thick of a very serious epidemic. But those \\nconnections are trying to be made, and I have to give \\nCongressman Rogers a lot of credit for being a convener.\\n    Senator Shaheen. Thank you.\\n    Senator Blunt. Thank you, Senator Shaheen.\\n    Dr. Collins, thank you and thank you for the fine \\nrepresentation of your team. As you suggested, there are even \\nmore on the bench that you could call in at some future time \\nfor a hearing. We might ask you to do that.\\n\\n                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS\\n\\n    Over the next week, the record will stay open for \\nquestions. I know Senator Alexander and others have already put \\nsome questions out there, and I am sure you will get some.\\n    [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but \\nwere submitted to the Department for response subsequent to the \\nhearing:]\\n             Questions Submitted to Dr. Francis S. Collins\\n                Questions Submitted by Senator Roy Blunt\\n                          alzheimer's funding\\n    Question. Dr. Collins, the Senate received the NIH's first bypass \\nbudget for funding Alzheimer's disease which requested an increase of \\n$323 million for fiscal year 2017.\\n  --Given that the Senate Labor/HHS bill for fiscal year 2016 provides \\n        more funding ($350 million) than what NIH requested for fiscal \\n        year 2017, how would the bypass budget be changed for next \\n        year?\\n  --Can we assume all of the requested research projects for fiscal \\n        year 2017 would, instead, be done in fiscal year 2016 if the \\n        Senate funding level for NIH is enacted?\\n  --Dr. Collins, how do you prioritize funding for a disease when you \\n        know, as in the case of Alzheimer's disease, that the disease \\n        burden is only going to increase over the next 20 years?\\n    Dr. Collins, has Alzheimer's research had significant application \\nto other major disease research efforts? What crossover benefits have \\nwe seen from increasing Alzheimer's research funding?\\n    Answer. NIH recognized that a substantial increase in funding for \\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) for fiscal year 2016 would have an impact on \\nthe implementation of the milestones linked to the fiscal year 2017 \\nBypass Budget. To address this possibility, NIH created a separate plan \\nfor accelerating many of the activities outlined in the fiscal year \\n2017 Bypass Budget milestones to be initiated in fiscal year 2016. \\nUnder this circumstance, the fiscal year 2018 Bypass Budget would \\nreflect this acceleration and include estimates for targeting new goals \\nfrom its overarching list of long-range milestones.\\\\1\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Https://www.nia.nih.gov/budget-files/alzheimers-disease-\\nresearch-implementation-milestones-2013-2025.pdf.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Not all of the projects outlined in the fiscal year 2017 milestones \\ncan be accelerated into fiscal year 2016, even if the Senate funding \\nlevel for NIH is enacted. For example, the creation of new cohorts to \\naccelerate the identification of gene variants and other risk and \\nprotective factors is a lengthy, detailed, and labor-intensive process, \\nas it involves the collection of large amounts of data, including \\ninformed consent from thousands of participants. In addition, some \\nresearch areas require further development and will be explored further \\nin fiscal year 2017. These include aging processes in human cell models \\nof AD; the planned biorepository for AD biological samples; \\ntranslational bioinformatics; and validation of the NIH Toolbox for \\nAssessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function, among others.\\n    NIH recognizes that the public health burden of AD will only become \\nlarger, if preventative therapies and treatments are not established. \\nAD is a prominent focus of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership, a \\nmajor public-private partnership between NIH, FDA, 10 biopharmaceutical \\ncompanies and multiple non-profit organizations to transform the \\ncurrent model for developing new diagnostics and treatments by jointly \\nidentifying and validating promising biological targets for \\ntherapeutics.\\n    Increased support for Alzheimer's has advanced our knowledge not \\nonly of that disease, but of other diseases and conditions, as well--\\nmost notably other neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal \\ndementia (FTD). For example:\\n  --The efforts toward discovery and standardization of imaging \\n        biomarkers made in Alzheimer's are being leveraged in other \\n        neurodegenerative diseases, such as FTD and Parkinson's \\n        disease.\\n  --Investments in fluid biomarker discovery using various ``omics'' \\n        technologies--metabolomics in particular--are geared toward the \\n        identification of biomarkers that can be used to stratify \\n        patients for clinical trials, and identify participants most \\n        likely to respond to a specific therapy, for both AD and \\n        related dementias.\\n  --NIA has funded research on the development of human induced \\n        pluripotent stem (iPS) cells for AD modeling. Further studies \\n        have shown that such use of ``disease-in-a-dish'' models can be \\n        effectively used to study molecular mechanisms underlying not \\n        only AD, but also other neurodegenerative and \\n        neurodevelopmental diseases.\\n    Systems biology approaches aimed at identifying complex genetic and \\nmolecular networks, such as the Accelerating Medicines Partnership \\n(AMP), will enable the identification of molecular signatures and \\nnetworks underlying the various disease processes that lead to symptoms \\nassociated with AD. These efforts will lay the foundation for precision \\nmedicine for AD and other dementias (i.e., it will enable us to treat \\nthe right disease process with the right drug at the right time). The \\nAMP-AD systems biology efforts will also enable us to identify \\nmolecular events that are shared between AD and other disorders. This \\ncould facilitate successful repurposing of drugs that prove effective \\nfor AD for their use in other neurodegenerative conditions with similar \\nunderlying pathologies--and vice versa.\\n    Finally, NIH-supported Alzheimer's genetics initiatives have \\nprovided genetic information relevant to several unrelated conditions, \\nincluding autism, congenital heart disease, scoliosis, pain, cancer, \\nand neurologic disease. In 2012, the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer's \\nDisease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) and the Database for Genotypes and \\nPhenotypes (dbGaP) formed a unique partnership in order to efficiently \\nprovide data to the research community. Through this exceptional \\narrangement, dbGaP's capacity to work with specific genetics user \\ncommunities was augmented. The interface between the two databases now \\nserves as a prototype for other genetics user communities; similar \\ndesigns are being explored or planned by three other NIH Institutes \\n(NINDS, NHGRI, and NHLBI). Most recently, the Gabrielle Miller Kids \\nFund Common Fund initiative has engaged NIAGADS for discussion on \\ndesign of a similar interface.\\n                           precision medicine\\n    Question. Dr. Collins, at our hearing in April, we discussed the \\nrevolutionary idea of Precision Medicine. Since that time, NIH has made \\nprogress on developing a plan to move this initiative forward and \\nstakeholders have been able to express their thoughts about the plan. I \\nhave heard several concerns from cancer researchers about the 1 million \\nperson cohort. In particular, researchers have expressed concern about \\nwhat scientific question a cohort would be answering and how the NIH \\nwould ensure the cohort includes a proportionate representation of \\nAmericans, particularly individuals from racial and ethnic minorities.\\n    What are your views on these concerns and can you discuss how the \\ncohort would be setup to take into consideration these concerns and how \\na 1 million person cohort will inform the initiative?\\n    Answer. The appropriate size, composition, and research power of \\nthe Precision Medicine Initiative\\x04 (PMI) cohort were major foci of the \\ndeliberations of the PMI Working Group of the Advisory Committee to the \\nDirector, which delivered its blue print for the PMI Cohort Program on \\nSeptember 17, 2015. The Working Group included renowned experts from \\nall sectors: private and public sectors, academic research, clinicians, \\nand participants. Their deliberations and recommendations were informed \\nby four major national workshops, two requests for information, and a \\npublic survey. The primary objective of the PMI Cohort Program will be \\nto enroll one million or more volunteers into a cohort that broadly \\nreflects the diversity of the U.S. population, and to follow their \\nhealth and clinical outcomes over time. The PMI Working Group report \\nhas been widely embraced and applauded by the scientific community \\nincluding industry and patient groups.\\n    NIH has now released a number of funding opportunities to solicit \\nthe very best ideas from the scientific community to build the PMI \\nCohort (https://www.nih.gov/precision-medicine-initiative-cohort-\\nprogram/funding-opportunities). The funding opportunities specifically \\nrequest that applicants address past experience with inclusion of \\ndiverse populations and provide specifics plans a capabilities for \\ndoing so as a part of the PMI Cohort Program. The potential of this \\ndiverse cohort of one million or more presents a spectacular variety of \\nscientific opportunities, including:\\n  --Develop quantitative estimates of risk for a range of diseases by \\n        integrating environmental exposures, genetic factors and gene-\\n        environment interactions\\n  --Identify the causes of individual variation in response to commonly \\n        used therapeutics (pharmacogenomics)\\n  --Discover biological markers that signal increased or decreased risk \\n        of developing common diseases\\n  --Use mobile health (mHealth) technologies to correlate activity, \\n        physiological measures and environmental exposures with health \\n        outcomes\\n  --Develop new disease classifications and relationships\\n  --Empower study participants with data and information to improve \\n        their own health\\n  --Create a platform to enable trials of targeted therapies\\n                   pmi and national children's study\\n    Question. Congress appropriated over $1 billion over a decade for a \\ncohort of children as part of the National Children's Study (NCS). The \\nNCS was plagued with problems, in particular with composing a cohort \\nthat adequately reflected the diversity of Americans. It eventually was \\nended in 2014 with virtually no studies being conducted and $1 billion \\nbeing spent. How do we ensure that this will not happen with the \\nPrecision Medicine cohort?\\n    Answer. In order to pre-emptively identify and address challenges \\nthat the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) Cohort, a large-scale, \\nlongitudinal cohort, might face, the PMI Working Group consulted on \\nthis issue with research cohort management experts including David \\nMurray, the NIH Associate Director for Prevention who is tasked with \\nmanaging the closure of the NCS, and Sir Rory Collins, the Chief \\nExecutive of the UK Biobank and a member of the PMI Working Group. \\nThese consultations resulted in a number of ``lessons learned'' for \\nboth successful (the UK Biobank was able to bounce back after initial \\nchallenges) and unsuccessful (NCS was unable to find its footing) \\nlarge-scale cohort studies. These lessons included the suggestion to \\nguide the cohort design with a limited set of research questions; to \\nrequire partners to provide high degrees of data standardization and \\ncentralize core data; to select a sampling approach that is efficient \\nand feasible; to design a strong and nimble governance structure that \\nis aware of and rapidly responsive to changes in the social, \\ntechnological, and scientific elements arising in a cohort over time; \\nto carefully select the right funding mechanisms for the project scope; \\nto carefully test new procedures in small pilots; and to ensure that \\nenrollment is convenient.\\n    These ``lessons learned'' were incorporated into the PMI Working \\nGroup recommendations for the PMI Cohort Program. For example, the \\nWorking Group began its work by defining the scientific questions it \\nexpected the cohort to be able to answer. It recommended a core data \\nset required for partner organizations and volunteers that will be \\ncollected in a centralized data center, with federated inquiries \\navailable for other data. It recommended an approach that favors \\ndiversity over representativeness, and a small and powerful governance \\nstructure, composed primarily of one director and a small executive \\ncommittee, that will ensure that the PMI Cohort Program can be \\nimmediately responsive to necessary changes in the program's structure. \\nThe NIH carefully examined the best funding mechanisms for each element \\nof the program, and proposes early pilots that will allow us to \\ncarefully test and retest the program elements, including proposals to \\ntest the best way to enroll participants directly as well as through \\nhealthcare provider organizations (see Blunt Question: PMI Accuracy and \\nQuality).\\n                    pmi accuracy and quality of data\\n    Question. Dr. Collins, it is challenging to deal with the accuracy \\nand quality of data when it comes from multiple sources. How will the \\nPrecision Medicine cohort deal with this issue?\\n    Answer. The accuracy and quality of the Precision Medicine \\nInitiative\\x04 (PMI) cohort data was another focal point of discussions \\nfor the PMI Working Group of the Advisory Committee to the Director. \\nThe PMI Working Group included multiple experts in the field of \\nbioinformatics and ``big data'' research, all of whom emphasized that \\ndata standards should be developed before data collection begins, given \\nthat the use of data standards promotes quality science, consistency in \\ndata use and re-use, and meta-analysis. PMI Working Group deliberations \\nand recommendations were also informed by four major national \\nworkshops, one of which focused specifically on scientific and \\nmethodologic considerations to maximize the quality, accuracy, and \\nutility of detailed health information for PMI Cohort participants. The \\nPMI Working Group made a number of recommendations that NIH will \\nimplement in order to ensure accuracy and quality of PMI data coming \\nfrom multiple sources, such as recommendation to create a data \\ncoordinating center that will be responsible for the storage, \\nmanagement, and transmission of a curated and analysis-ready core set \\nof data; to develop a system whereby the details of data collection and \\ncuration will be agreed upon between data collection sites and the data \\ncoordinating center before data collection begins; to adopt and utilize \\nexisting data standards to the greatest extent possible and require the \\nuse of common data models to develop a structured core data set that \\ncan be distributed to researchers; and to establish a data subcommittee \\nof the PMI Cohort Program governance structure to oversee ongoing data \\ncollection and ensure that the program maintains high quality, \\naccuracy, and utility.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n               Questions Submitted by Senator Jerry Moran\\n                      alzheimer's disease research\\n    Question. Following the Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit last \\nFebruary, NIH is poised to revise the research milestones created by \\nthe National Plan. When can we expect to see in the updated milestones? \\nTo what extent do those milestones match the recommendations that were \\nprinted in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia in October of last year? \\nDoes NIH intend to release program announcements that are tied to the \\nmilestones document?\\n    Answer. NIH released two related sets of research milestones, along \\nwith the fiscal year 2017 Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias \\nBypass Budget, on July 27, 2015. One was a broad set of Alzheimer's-\\nspecific milestones that included a number of long-range research goals \\nthat extend to 2025: https://www.nia.nih.gov/budget-files/alzheimers-\\ndisease-research-implementation-milestones-2013-2025.pdf. These \\nmilestones reflected recommendations made across the diverse range of \\nresearch topics covered at the 2015 Alzheimer's Disease Research \\nSummit. NIH also released a set of fiscal year 2017-specific milestones \\nfor Alzheimer's and related dementias (https://www.nia.nih.gov/budget-\\nfiles/fy-2017-alzheimers-disease-bypass-budget-milestones.pdf). The \\nlatter milestones were used to develop the fiscal year 2017 Alzheimer's \\nDisease and Related Dementias Bypass Budget: https://www.nia.nih.gov/\\nbudget-files/Reaching-for-a-Cure-Alzheimers-Disease-and-Related-\\nDementias-Research-at-NIH.pdf. Thirteen NIH ICs contributed to the \\nfiscal year 2017 milestones, and they were informed by two scientific \\nmeetings (in addition to the 2012 and 2015 Alzheimer's Disease Research \\nSummits), the 2013 conference on Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias, \\nand the 2013 meeting on Advancing Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease in \\nIndividuals with Down Syndrome.\\n    With respect to the relationship between the NIH's established \\nmilestones and the recommendations for updating the 2012 milestones \\npublished in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, there is considerable \\noverlap. The recommendations published in the academic journal reflect \\ninput assembled by a non-Federal funding organization, and NIH took \\nthese recommendations into consideration as it produced its latest \\npublished research milestones.\\n    Ten Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) were released by the \\nNIA in the fall of 2015 to address the updated research milestones and \\noffer flexibility for funding in a wide range of budgetary \\ncircumstances. The FOAs have set-aside funds associated with them, and \\nwill be supported according to the availability of funds in fiscal year \\n2016 and fiscal year 2017. They fall into seven broad categories, and \\noffer opportunities for investigators in virtually every aspect of AD \\nresearch--including health disparities, caregiving, epidemiology, \\ndiagnosis and prediction, molecular and cellular mechanisms, brain \\naging, and clinical trials. These FOAs incorporate themes and \\nrecommendations from the 2012 and 2015 Alzheimer's Disease Research \\nSummits. The categories are intentionally wide-ranging and each FOA is \\nimportant in its own way.\\n                            brain initiative\\n    Question. What would be the biggest impact of a shortfall in the \\nprojected funding for the BRAIN Initiative?\\n    Answer. The biggest impact lies in the inability to fully, and in a \\ntimely manner, realize the bold, ambitious goal of the BRAIN \\nInitiative: to revolutionize our understanding of the human brain, and \\nempower researchers seeking new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent \\nbrain disorders.\\n    The gap between NIH's fiscal year 2015 budget request for the BRAIN \\nInitiative, and the funds actually appropriated, has two direct \\nconsequences. First, it delays the overall pace at which NIH can scale-\\nup its efforts for the BRAIN Initiative, causing scientific progress to \\nfall further and further behind the 12-year plan laid out by the \\nAdvisory Committee to the NIH Director (ACD) in their report BRAIN \\n2025: A Scientific Vision. The BRAIN 2025 plan outlines a step-wise \\nsequence of research with subsequent steps dependent upon prior \\nsuccess. Shortfalls in funding slow the stepwise progress. Secondly, it \\nforces NIH to scale back the scope of research being funded under \\ncurrent Funding Opportunities which leads to gaps that could undermine \\nthe solid foundation laid out in the BRAIN 2025 plan. As one example, a \\nmajor project in the BRAIN Initiative is to assemble research teams to \\ncollect, analyze, and share data from recordings of the human brain. \\nThis project was vetted by the external scientific experts that compose \\nthe BRAIN Multi-Council Working Group and was announced to the \\nscientific community in fiscal year 2015. However, the grant \\nsolicitation process was halted due to the gap between the budget \\nrequest and appropriated funds. This project and the fiscal year 2016 \\nprojects described below are ready to launch pending budget \\navailability. In general, the competition for the fiscal year 2015 \\nBRAIN Initiative awards was extremely competitive and funds were \\ninsufficient to support many otherwise excellent proposals.\\n    The BRAIN Initiative is focused on developing neurotechnologies \\nthat enable scientists to understand the functions of specific brain \\ncircuits, including circuits relevant to neurological disorders such as \\nParkinson's disease, epilepsy, recovery from traumatic brain injury and \\nstroke, mental illness, and addiction. To achieve this goal, NIH is \\nfunding teams of engineers, physicists, chemists, and neuroscientists \\nto develop devices that can record and modulate activity in the brain \\nat scales that span from single neurons to entire brain regions. This \\nwork promises to enable accurate early diagnosis of disorders of brain \\ncircuit activity such as depression, autism, and schizophrenia, as well \\nas to build upon the success of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's \\ndisease to develop new ways to reduce suffering caused by a variety of \\nneurological and mental illnesses. Funding shortfalls inevitably lead \\nto delays in achieving such goals. These delays mean that people \\nsuffering now with devastating brain diseases and disorders may have to \\nwait longer for the treatment breakthroughs that could transform their \\nlives and the lives of their families and communities.\\n                      alzheimer's disease research\\n    Question. Recent budgets have included money to expand research \\nefforts related to Alzheimer's disease. Can you tell me about some of \\nthose efforts and things you hope to achieve in the next few years?\\n    Answer. New investments include large-scale research for \\nidentification of new risk and protective genes; development of new \\ncellular models of the disease to enable rapid screens of potential \\ntherapeutic agents; establishment of translational centers that will \\nsupport drug discovery and development; and groundbreaking prevention \\ntrials in people at the highest risk of disease. Joint initiatives are \\nidentifying imaging and fluid biomarkers that enable us to detect and \\ntrack the onset and progression of Alzheimer's-related brain changes. \\nClinical trials are now underway testing therapies in pre-symptomatic \\nvolunteers at risk for developing Alzheimer's. These ground-breaking \\ntrials may lead to the long-sought interventions that can directly \\ninfluence the underlying pathology. Collaborations among NIH, the \\nbiomedical industry and advocacy groups--such as the Accelerating \\nMedicines Partnership--are overcoming traditional barriers to drug \\ndiscovery.\\n    Other new investments include the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing \\nProject supporting the analysis of whole exome and genome sequencing \\ndata; testing of anti-amyloid drug interventions through the \\nAlzheimer's Prevention Initiative APOE4 trial and the Dominantly \\nInherited Alzheimer's Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU); and studies of \\nexercise and physical activity in preventing, treating, and managing \\nAlzheimer's disease. Research is also being continued on support \\ninterventions for those caring for individuals with Alzheimer's disease \\nand other dementias; for example, the NIA-funded REACH II intervention \\nthat is currently being broadly translated in 15 States through the \\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and in 3 States by the Administration on \\nAging.\\n    Recently, NIA released 10 Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs). \\nThese FOAs incorporate themes and recommendations from the 2012 and \\n2015 Alzheimer's Disease Research Summits. They fall into seven broad \\ncategories, and offer opportunities for investigators in virtually \\nevery aspect of AD research--including health disparities, caregiving, \\nepidemiology, diagnosis and prediction, molecular and cellular \\nmechanisms, brain aging, and clinical trials. The FOAs have set-aside \\nfunds associated with them, and will be supported according to the \\navailability of funds in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017.\\n    Finally, while Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of \\ndementia, related dementias, including vascular, frontotemporal, and \\nLewy body dementias, also represent a significant burden of dementia. \\nBrain vascular disease such as silent stroke, diffuse white matter \\ndisease and arteriosclerosis is exceedingly common in persons with \\nAlzheimer's dementia. The neurodegenerative processes can be difficult \\nto distinguish clinically and frequently overlap. Research, too, is \\nfocused on neural processes that are shared among the different \\nneurodegenerative disease and how aged blood vessels contribute to loss \\nof brain function. For instance, increased funding for Alzheimer's and \\nrelated dementia research allows researchers to begin sequencing DNA \\nfrom 1,500 people with frontotemporal dementia and 1,300 people with \\nLewy body dementia to identify regions of DNA associated with risk for \\nthese disease and has enabled scientists to better understand the \\ninteractions between blood vessels, neurons, support cells, and \\nproteins associated with Alzheimer's disease and how these interactions \\ncontribute to dementia.\\n           impact of cr to the precision medicine initiative\\n    Question. I know NIH has kicked off its precision medicine \\ninitiative, which has generated quite a bit of excitement. With the \\nagency currently under a continuing resolution, what precision medicine \\nefforts are currently being delayed by limitations on new starts and \\nnew efforts?\\n    Answer. NIH efforts around the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) \\ninclude both PMI Cohort Program, coordinated through the NIH Office of \\nthe Director (OD), and PMI for Oncology, coordinated through the \\nNational Cancer Institute (NCI). NIH OD is working diligently to \\nimplement the PMI Working Group's recommendations to build the PMI \\nCohort Program, developing funding opportunities, governance roles, and \\nstructures, and working to promote policies that are needed for the \\nsuccess of the PMI Cohort Program. These preparations are critical for \\nensuring that the PMI Cohort Program can begin its important work as \\nsoon as possible. Much of this planning can be done under the current \\ncontinuing resolution, but a full-year continuing resolution would \\nrequire us to put a halt to all of the PMI Cohort Program efforts. \\nSimilarly, NCI's PMI for Oncology has begun foundational work upon \\nwhich it will build its PMI effort. By way of example, enrollment was \\nopen and highly successful for the NCI-MATCH trial, which will be \\ndramatically expanded under the PMI, adding more sites and adding more \\ntherapeutic agents, as well as speeding the development Pediatric \\nMATCH. These planned expansions are jeopardized under the continuing \\nresolution, slowing the progress of this critical trial.\\n              funding grants during continuing resolution\\n    Question. The NIH has a set system for operating and dealing with \\nits grant portfolio during a continuing resolution. Could you please \\ndescribe the methodology you must implement when NIH does not have a \\nfull-year appropriation?\\n    Answer. When NIH operates under a continuing resolution (CR) for \\npart of the year, a Notice in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts is \\nreleased describing the financial operations planned for grant awards \\nduring the CR (An example notice is NOT-OD-15-050, found at http://\\ngrants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-050.html). \\nGenerally, NIH's funding policy is to fund non-competing continuation \\nawards at up to 90 percent of the committed award level, noting that \\nreductions may be restored after an appropriation is in place. Since \\nnew, competing awards have not yet been committed, they are typically \\nheld until either appropriations legislation has been passed or, as in \\nfiscal year 2011, a CR is approved to set funding levels through the \\nend of the fiscal year. As a consequence, funding is delayed for highly \\nmeritorious new awards that are ready to be funded at the start of the \\nfiscal year.\\n    In fiscal years 2011-2015, more than three-fourths of NIH's new, \\ncompeting grants were awarded in the third and fourth quarters when a \\nfinal funding resolution or appropriation was in place. Thus, new, \\ncompeting awards bear the brunt of funding delays. However, since \\nyearly continuation award dates are linked to the date of the original, \\ncompeting award, the practice of issuing multiple continuing \\nresolutions affects the NIH funding cycle for the 4-5 year life of new \\nawards issued in a given fiscal year.\\n                       neuronext clinical trials\\n    Question. The University of Kansas Medical Center is a site in the \\nnew NeuroNEXT clinical trials consortium. Can you tell us about the \\nNeuroNEXT clinical trials program and how it has been a success in \\ndelivering clinical trials to neurology patients faster and more \\nefficiently?\\n    Answer. The NIH Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical \\nTrials was established in 2011 to provide shared infrastructure and \\ncentralized resources to expedite the development and execution of \\nearly phase clinical studies across a range of neurological disorders \\naffecting adult and/or pediatric populations. To date, the network has \\ninitiated five clinical trials in five different neurological \\nconditions and is streamlining the process of testing new therapies in \\npatients.\\n    The first study in the network completed enrollment ahead of \\nschedule, and investigators are currently analyzing the data to \\nidentify early biological markers of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in \\ninfants. The raw data from this study will also be shared with the FDA \\nin order to inform their ongoing evaluations of potential treatments \\nfor SMA. Three other trials are underway and are on target to complete \\nenrollment on or ahead of schedule: one study is testing the safety and \\nefficacy of a potential neuroprotective therapy in patients with \\nprogressive multiple sclerosis; another is exploring whether the drug \\nrituximab can reduce the need for steroid use (which can have \\nintolerable side effects) in patients with myasthenia gravis; and \\nanother is testing a new agent that has the potential to protect brain \\ntissue in patients with moderate strokes who have been given the clot-\\nbusting drug tPA. The fifth study in the network was recently approved \\nand will assess the tolerability of a new drug for treatment of \\naggression and irritability in patients with Huntington's Disease (HD), \\nwhich are among the most distressing aspects of the disease.\\n    NeuroNEXT has successfully engaged communities and partnered with \\nprivate entities. Patient advocacy groups have been involved in all of \\nthe NeuroNEXT studies from early stage protocol development through the \\nactual conduct of the study. The HD study is being conducted as a Small \\nBusiness Innovative Research (SBIR) project, and the other studies have \\nreceived contributions from private industry partners. The use of \\nshared infrastructure and centralized expertise and resources, such as \\na single Institutional Review Board, has reduced inefficiencies and \\nenabled the NeuroNEXT studies to achieve quicker start-up times than \\nwould have been possible in the traditional approach of establishing \\nseparate multi-site processes for each new trial. Further, their \\nability to consistently meet recruitment targets on schedule decreases \\nclinical trial costs and facilitates on-time study completion. The \\nexpertise of the NeuroNEXT team and their ability to effectively \\nrecruit and partner across a broad range of neurology disciplines is \\nreflected in the diversity of disorders and patient populations being \\naddressed by the network.\\n                           pmi working group\\n    Question. The PMI Working Group that Dr. Collins discussed in his \\nQFR response has issued a report (which you probably have seen, but \\nhere it is for sake of convenience.\\\\2\\\\ The Working Group recognized \\nthat excluding children would ``limit the scientific validity and \\nutility of the cohort, deprive PMI cohort participants of opportunities \\nto benefit from research, and worse, could increase health disparities \\nfor these groups.'' The Working Group also recommended that the PMI--P \\ninclude individuals from all life stages.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\2\\\\ Http://www.nih.gov/precisionmedicine/09172015-pmi-working-\\ngroup-report.pdf\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    However, in reference to inclusion of special populations such as \\nchildren, the Working Group noted that there are ``scientific, ethical \\nand policies issues surrounding these populations that warrant further \\ndiscussion. Therefore, the Working Group recommends that NIH consider \\nthe safeguards necessary to ensure the appropriate enrollment, \\nretention, and protection of these groups into the PMI cohort.''\\n    Considering these statements from the Working Group, could we get \\nan update on NIH's plans for including a pediatric population within \\nthe PMI research cohort now that the Working Group has made \\nrecommendations?\\n    Answer. NIH will include children as participants in the PMI Cohort \\nProgram. As recommended by the PMI Working Group, NIH is currently \\nconsidering how to best incorporate pediatric participants into the \\ncohort while fully addressing the unique scientific approaches and \\nethical commitments to this population.\\n    Children present a unique set of legal, ethical and policy issues \\nin clinical research that warrant careful consideration before actively \\nrecruiting them into the cohort. For example, existing Federal rules \\nfor the protection of research participants provide specific regulatory \\nrequirements for research involving children, including additional \\nreview by the Institutional Review Board and special consent \\nprocedures.\\\\3\\\\ NIH is looking at an early pilot to enroll families as a \\nway to test the best approaches to pediatric participation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ Please see the HHS Office for Human Research Protections \\nguidance on subpart D of the HHS regulations at 45 CFR part 46 to learn \\nmore about regulations for research involving children at http://\\nwww.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/faq/children-research/special-requirements-\\nchildren-research.html.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n              Questions Submitted by Senator Thad Cochran\\n                           cannabidiol (cbd)\\n    Question. At NIH, the Congress traditionally has allowed science to \\ndictate how research dollars are spent. What is the potential utility \\nof CBD-rich extracts in refractory childhood epilepsy (and perhaps \\nother neurological disorders) and is the science there to justify the \\nexpenditure of Federal funds for research in this area?\\n    Answer. There is evidence from small non-controlled (open label) \\nstudies that Cannabidiol-rich extracts may be effective in treating \\ncertain severe forms of childhood epilepsy in some individuals. Other \\nstudies have suggested that medical marijuana in various forms may \\nrelieve some symptoms of other neurological disorders. While these \\nstudies point to the promise of this research, they also highlight the \\nneed for rigorous studies to determine the safety and effectiveness of \\nthese compounds in treating neurological disorders, especially in \\nchildren. Investigator-initiated research deemed meritorious through \\nNIH's peer review process that follows applicable regulations would be \\nan appropriate mechanism to help answer these important questions. The \\nNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is \\ncurrently conducting studies to investigate the anti-seizure activity \\nof some of these compounds through NINDS's Anticonvulsant Screening \\nProgram (ASP), which offers academic and industry-based investigators \\nthe opportunity to screen compounds for anti-seizure activity in a \\nbattery of well-established rodent seizure models. Having obtained \\napproval for appropriate Schedule 1 licenses, ASP is now collaborating \\nwith NIDA to conduct anti-seizure studies in rodents on Cannabidiol and \\ntetrahydrocannabidiol (THC), the primary psychotropic compounds found \\nin marijuana.\\n    Question. If the science is there to justify CBD research, does NIH \\nhave sufficient funding for researchers to conduct these clinical \\ntrials?\\n    Answer. In general, NIH does not set aside funding for research in \\na particular area, but rather funds the most meritorious investigator-\\ninitiated research--as determined by the NIH peer review process--\\nacross all the research areas within the NIH mission. Proposals for \\nclinical trials are carefully reviewed to insure that there is \\nsufficient pre-clinical research prior to testing potential therapies \\nin humans. NIH welcomes investigator-initiated research on pre-clinical \\nand clinical research on the promise of CBD for treating disease.\\n    Question. Does NIDA's current contractor, the University of \\nMississippi, have the capacity to cultivate sufficient cannabis to meet \\nresearchers' needs and the ability to produce CBD under Current Good \\nManufacturing Practices (cGMP) for clinical research/trials?\\n    Answer. The University of Mississippi has been able to meet the \\nsupply demands of the scientific community for marijuana thus far; \\nhowever, interest in marijuana research is rapidly growing and \\nresearchers are interested in many diverse strains of marijuana \\nincluding strains with high levels of CBD. While the NIDA contractor \\ncould increase the volume of marijuana grown and available it would be \\nimpractical for NIDA to produce, at this single facility, more than a \\nfew of the varieties of marijuana currently being used in the various \\nStates. This has led some to argue that it is important to license \\nadditional growers of marijuana for research purposes. Federal agencies \\nincluding HHS, the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of National \\nDrug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the State Department have been working \\ntogether to identify potential solutions to this issue that are in \\ncompliance with U.S. laws and international treaty obligations.\\n    Currently, the NIDA Drug Supply Program does supply CBD for animal \\nresearch purposes, and the University of Mississippi has developed a \\nmarijuana extract with a high concentration of CBD under cGMP \\nprocedures. This extract is available for human research studies; \\nhowever, the current formulation is not conducive for easy \\nadministration within human clinical trials. Researchers interested in \\nusing this extract for human studies would need to develop a \\nformulation for easy administration (e.g., oral suspension in sesame \\noil). NIDA is currently working with the FDA to develop easy-to-use \\nformulations and dosages of this extract for human research.\\n    In addition, NIDA recently awarded an SBIR to Aphios to develop a \\nmethod for generating cGMP grade CBD for use in clinical trials and \\nother research projects. The primary goal of this research program is \\nto develop a process for manufacturing pharmaceutical grade CBD \\nfollowing current cGMP of the FDA for use in clinical trials for \\nchildhood epilepsy and other indications. The secondary goal is to \\ndevelop a standardized, enriched CBD product for use in clinical \\ntrials. Having additional suppliers of both marijuana plant products \\nand purified CBD would ensure that these products are available to \\nscientists in a more timely fashion.\\n    Question. If there is both the capacity to cultivate sufficient \\namounts of cannabis and the ability to produce CBD under cGMP at the \\nUniversity of Mississippi, is the barrier to production due to a lack \\nof funding within NIDA?\\n    Answer. The University of Mississippi has been able to meet the \\nsupply demands of the scientific community for marijuana thus far.\\n                              idea program\\n    Question. The Mississippi IDeA Network of Biomedical Research \\nExcellence links colleges and universities across the State in order to \\nengage our talented researchers and students in research projects. \\nNIH's investment in the IDeA program, which benefits almost half the \\nStates in the Nation, is relatively modest compared to the overall NIH \\nbudget. Do you plan to invest more in the IDeA program in the future \\nand what are your strategies for continuing to ensure the success of \\nthis program?\\n    Answer. NIH appreciates the Committee's support for the \\nInstitutional Development Award (IDeA) program and recognition of the \\nimportance of the goals of providing research infrastructure and \\nbuilding research capacity in the IDeA institutions. In fiscal year \\n2016, NIH anticipates making 12 new Center of Biomedical Research \\nExcellence (COBRE Phase I) awards and supporting up to 8 COBRE \\ncompeting continuation (Phase II) awards and 6-7 new COBRE Phase III \\nawards. Twenty-three IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence \\n(INBRE) awards have competed successfully for continued support. NIH \\nanticipates making one additional competing continuation INBRE award \\nand 4 new IDeA-CTR awards. NIH also anticipates co-funding 25 R01 and \\nR15 awards across NIH Institutes and Centers. Additionally, support \\nwill be provided for the non-competing COBRE, Institutional Development \\nAward Program Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research \\n(IDeA-CTR), and INBRE awards that constitute the IDeA base.\\n    To ensure the success of this program, NIH plans to:\\n  --Continue to build active biomedical research environments in IDeA \\n        States and improve access to modern, state-of the-art \\n        biomedical research for students, researchers, and the general \\n        public in IDeA States.\\n  --Ensure that States without medical schools have an opportunity to \\n        develop research capacity for conducting basic, translational \\n        and clinical research.\\n  --Continue to provide opportunities to address health disparities in \\n        medically underserved groups residing in IDeA States.\\n  --Continue promoting the Small Business Innovation Research/Small \\n        Business Technology Transfer programs, technology transfer, \\n        entrepreneurship, and public-private partnerships to create and \\n        enhance vibrant translational research environments within IDeA \\n        supported institutions.\\n  --Encourage collaborations and leveraging among IDeA research \\n        resource centers to capitalize on each other's unique \\n        capabilities to solve complex research queries, and encourage \\n        consolidation of research resources that hold complementary \\n        technologies to improve efficiency and create economies of \\n        scale.\\n  --Enhance the competitiveness of institutions by providing \\n        opportunities for talented undergraduate students to \\n        participate in research training and research careers in the \\n        biomedical sciences.\\n    Develop best practices, training tools, workflows, databases, and \\nanalysis tools that assist clinical and translational researchers to \\ndevelop and perform clinical and translational protocols to quickly and \\nefficiently address important questions in multiple areas of science.\\n                leveraging existing alzheimer's research\\n    Question. The University of Mississippi Medical Center serves as a \\nstudy site and conducts research in the Atherosclerosis Risk in \\nCommunities (ARIC) Neurocognitive Study. This study is the most \\ncomprehensive research project currently funded by NIH that examines \\nrisk factors for dementia. How do you plan to maximize the potential of \\nexisting research studies, like ARIC, as NIH moves forward with the \\nBRAIN initiative?\\n    Answer. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) is a \\nprospective study of almost 16,000 participants in four U.S. \\ncommunities that is exploring the causes and consequences of \\natherosclerosis, and how cardiovascular risk factors, medical care, and \\ndisease vary by race, gender, location, and date. Extensive medical, \\nsocial, and demographic information was collected on the participants \\nthrough five in-person examinations over 25 years, and their health \\nstatus continues to be followed annually by phone. The ARIC \\nNeurocognitive Study is investigating the role of midlife vascular risk \\nfactors in dementia and cognitive impairment, and how the burden of \\nthese conditions varies by race and sex. Cognitive testing has been \\nconducted to assess decline in cognitive ability, executive function, \\nmemory, and language skills, and brain MRI has been performed to detect \\nabnormalities known to be associated with cognitive impairment. These \\nstudies have led to the finding that high blood pressure in midlife was \\nassociated with cognitive decline in later life, results that were \\ndemonstrated in a recent publication (Gottesman et al., 2014. JAMA \\nNeurol; 71(10): 12181227). An additional ancillary study to ARIC is the \\nPET-Amyloid Imaging Study, which is conducting specialized brain \\nimaging on some of the participants to better understand the link \\nbetween vascular risk factors and hallmark characteristics of \\nAlzheimer's disease that can be seen on amyloid imaging, and how their \\nprevalence associates with development of dementia. The ARIC study \\nprovides an important opportunity to study potentially modifiable risk \\nfactors for dementia over a long period of time and thus could have \\nimportant implications for public health.\\n    In addition to large-scale observational studies such as ARIC, \\nresearch conducted through the Brain Research through Advancing \\nInnovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative also holds potential to \\nadvance dementia research. A patient's symptoms are the manifestation \\nof dysfunction in brain circuit activity, yet currently available tools \\nfor monitoring and modulating brain circuits are inadequate for fully \\nunderstanding the basis for neurological and mental disorders. The \\nBRAIN Initiative promises to deliver new technologies that will amplify \\nour ability to monitor and therapeutically change brain circuit \\nactivity, leading to a new understanding of how individual cells and \\ncomplex neural circuits interact in both normal and disordered \\nconditions. Advances in neuroimaging technologies in particular will \\nenhance our ability to study dementia and other brain disorders more \\neffectively. Unprecedented opportunities will emerge from these \\nadvances to pursue new ways to treat a wide range of brain disorders, \\nincluding dementia, and in combination with the wealth of knowledge we \\nare gaining from studies like ARIC NCS, the research community will be \\nwell poised to translate these discoveries into improved public health.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n                Questions Submitted by Senator Mark Kirk\\n                             batten disease\\n    Question. One of the cities I represent has been gripped by the \\nstory of Charlotte and Gwenyth Gray, two beautiful young girls \\ndiagnosed with Batten Disease, a neurodegenerative brain disease that \\nwill leave them blind, immobile, cognitively impaired and eventually \\ndead between the ages of 6 and 12. A disease for which currently there \\nis no treatment or cure. This community, that I am proud to represent, \\nrecently came together to raise $350,000 for research to cure Batten, \\ntrying to beat the clock for Charlotte and Gwenyth and believing that \\nno other parents and children should have to face this horrible disease \\nand deadly outcomes. However, as you well know, the funds that can be \\nraised privately pale in comparison to the Federal disease research \\ninfrastructure. What can NIH do to assist researchers racing to help \\nchildren with Batten Disease?\\n    Answer. NIH assists researchers racing to help children with Batten \\ndisease directly by supporting their research. NIH also supports the \\ndevelopment of research tools, resources, and basic research that \\nunderpins progress against many diseases, including Batten disease. For \\nexample, researchers studying Batten disease have applied genetic \\ntechnologies, online genetics databases, and informatics tools \\ndeveloped through NIH support to identify specific gene defects that \\ncause Batten disease. They have used methods from NIH investments in \\nbasic stem cell biology to develop induced pluripotent stem cells \\nderived from skin cells of patients with Batten disease that enable \\nthem to study crucial aspects of the disease in cell culture and to \\nscreen for potential treatments. And they have capitalized on advances \\nin genetic engineering to produce transgenic mouse models of Batten \\ndisease to study the disease and test interventions. Likewise, \\nresearchers developing candidate therapeutic interventions for Batten \\ndisease rely on more general progress in gene therapy, stem cells, \\nbiomarkers, imaging technologies, and methods to, among other example, \\nprovide access of therapeutic agents through the blood brain barrier. \\nFor example, studies are underway to advance gene therapy for Batten's \\ndisease using viral vectors to deliver the missing enzyme.\\n    Question. And how can this orphan disease and others like it, get \\nthe Federal grant funding they need to make a difference for children?\\n    Answer. Because of the devastating effects of Batten disease on the \\nbrain, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke \\n(NINDS) leads NIH research against this disease. Other parts of NIH \\nsupport research and bring their expertise to bear as appropriate to \\ntheir missions; for example, the National Eye Institute (NEI) supports \\nresearch on blindness caused by this disease. NINDS, like all of NIH, \\nplaces a high priority on supporting research against rare disorders \\nbecause the private sector is less likely to invest in rare diseases \\nand rare disorders provide crucial clues to more common diseases. Most \\nimportantly, rare diseases have an enormous impact on families. NINDS \\nprovides a wide array of different types of grants suitable for all \\ntypes of investigator-initiated research on rare diseases, from early \\nexploratory research to in-depth studies, and from basic research on \\ndisease mechanisms through preclinical therapy development and clinical \\ntrials. The NeuroNext clinical trial network was designed specifically \\nto serve the needs of clinical research in rare pediatric neurological \\ndiseases, such as Batten disease, as opportunities emerge. Private \\nadvocacy groups play a very important role in encouraging researchers \\nto take up the challenge of Batten disease and other rare diseases, and \\nNINDS scientific program directors guide investigators to take \\nadvantage of these funding opportunities. Currently funded grants \\nrelated to Batten disease include pilot projects, traditional R01 \\ngrants, and multi-investigator projects, and range from basic studies \\nto understand how gene defects cause harm, though early preclinical \\ntherapy development using a variety of strategies, and clinical studies \\nin patients to develop advanced MRI and laboratory tests to objectively \\nmeasure the progress of the disease and whether patients are responding \\nto therapies. The NIH RePORT website (https://projectreporter.nih.gov/\\nreporter.cfm) provides access to summaries and links to published \\nresults from current and past grants on Batten disease.\\n                     induced pluripotent stem cells\\n    Question. How are induced pluripotent stem cells being used in \\nlaboratories at NIH to advance biomedical research? To what extent has \\nthis research led to new treatments or cures?\\n    Answer. Recent research has demonstrated that stem cells have the \\nremarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the \\nbody. In many bodily tissues, stem cells serve as a kind of internal \\nrepair system, dividing extensively to replenish other cells as long as \\nthe person or animal is alive. When a stem cell divides, each new cell \\nhas the potential either to remain a stem cell or become another type \\nof cell with a more specialized function, such as a muscle cell, a red \\nblood cell, or a brain cell. A recently developed research technique, \\nwhich garnered the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, now \\nmakes it possible to create a new type of stem cell called an induced \\npluripotent stem (iPS) cell in the laboratory. iPS cells are derived \\nfrom mature cells, typically from a patient's skin or blood, which \\nresearchers can reprogram back to an immature state. These cells can \\nthen be turned into a wide variety of cell types, including liver \\ncells, neurons, cardiac cells, and blood cells. NIH-funded scientists \\nare studying iPS cells and other types of stem cells, not only to \\nunderstand better cell function and disease pathways, but also to \\ndevelop therapies for a variety of diseases and disabilities, including \\nParkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal cord \\ninjuries, heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. Since the development \\nof iPS cells is a relatively new discovery, most NIH funded research is \\nfocused on finding ways to develop different cell types from iPS cells, \\nrefining methods so that the resulting cells would be safe to use in \\npeople, and testing the cells in animal models. Three examples are \\ngiven here of promising approaches:\\n  --Macular degeneration: an NIH intramural scientist is pursuing \\n        preclinical efficacy and safety studies with retinal pigment \\n        epithelium tissue, developed from a patient's own skin cells \\n        using iPS technology, to treat age-related macular \\n        degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly.\\n  --Type 1 diabetes: NIH-funded researchers at Harvard University \\n        developed a multistep process to coax large numbers of both iPS \\n        cells and human embryonic stem cells into a state that closely \\n        resembles naturally-occurring pancreatic beta cells, with the \\n        ability to respond to fluctuating glucose levels by \\n        appropriately increasing or decreasing secretion of insulin. \\n        Two weeks after transplantation into a mouse model of type 1 \\n        diabetes, these stem cell-derived beta cells were still able to \\n        produce significant amounts of insulin in response to glucose \\n        and protect against hyperglycemia. Although the process will \\n        need to be adapted for large-scale manufacturing, and further \\n        tests must be conducted to determine if stem cell-derived beta \\n        cells can be a long-term replacement for beta cells in people, \\n        this dramatically improved process for making large amounts of \\n        beta cells is a promising step toward developing therapeutic \\n        stem cell therapies; it may also lead to advances in artificial \\n        organ development.\\n  --Liver failure: NIH-funded researchers at the University of \\n        California, San Francisco and the Gladstone Institutes have \\n        coaxed iPS cells into becoming what appear to be fully \\n        functional liver cells. They have developed a protocol that \\n        transforms human skin cells into mature liver cells that not \\n        only function normally in a lab dish, but proliferate after \\n        they have been transplanted into mice that model human liver \\n        failure. This ability to proliferate is a hallmark of normal \\n        liver cells--and the secret to the liver's astounding capacity \\n        to regenerate after infection or injury.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n              Questions Submitted by Senator Bill Cassidy\\n                              hiv funding\\n    Question. As was asked during the Appropriations Hearing on October \\n7, 2015, in fiscal year 2014, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \\nInstitute (NHLBI) received $64,044,000 from the Office of AIDS Research \\n(OAR) (or 2.1 percent of all the AIDS Research funding at NIH) to study \\nheart, lung, and blood disease co-morbidity with HIV. After much \\nresearch, we learned from the American Heart Association that in 2013, \\nthe CDC reported an incidence of 1,815 cardiovascular disease deaths \\nwith HIV as the underlying cause. CDC also reported that about 610,000 \\nAmericans die from cardiovascular disease every year. Of those who die \\nfrom cardiovascular disease each year, only .29 percent of them have \\nHIV as underlying cause--that is very low. During the meeting of the \\nNational, Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Committee in 2012, it was \\nreported that the success rates for AIDS application that were much \\nhigher than for non-AIDS applications--42 percent vs 18%--suggesting \\nthat projects with low review scores and low significance are being \\nfunded. Please provide answers to the following related questions:\\n  --What are the success rates for HIV related applications at the \\n        other NIH Institutes that receive OAR funding?\\n  --What are the success rates for non-HIV applications at Institutes?\\n    Answer. NIH Institutes and Centers provide AIDS funding to \\nunsolicited investigator-initiated grant applications and applications \\nsubmitted in response to specific funding opportunity announcements \\n(FOAs) that are deemed highly meritorious in NIH's dual level peer \\nreview process. Applications awarded under a FOA targeted to a specific \\nscientific topic or objective may appear to have an unusually high \\nsuccess rate, but this is not because projects with low review scores \\nand low significance are being funded; on the converse, targeted FOAs \\nsometimes attract a small number of applications prepared by applicants \\nwho are exceptionally qualified to address the objectives of the FOA, \\nand a larger proportion of these applications are deemed to be highly \\nmeritorious in the peer review process.\\n    The success rate indicates the percentage of reviewed grant \\napplications that were awarded on a fiscal year basis. It is determined \\nby dividing the number of competing applications funded by the sum of \\nthe total number of competing applications reviewed and the number of \\nfunded carryovers. The success rate calculation is always performed \\nafter the close of the fiscal year. To better reflect the funding of \\nunique research applications, the number of grant applications is \\nadjusted by removing the number of revised applications and correcting \\nfor projects where the resubmitted application is submitted in the same \\nyear as the original grant application.\\n    NIH supports a comprehensive program of biomedical, behavioral, and \\nsocial science research on HIV/AIDS and its associated comorbidities, \\ncoinfections, and other complications. As therapeutic approaches to \\nmanaging patients with HIV/AIDS have improved, so has the longevity of \\npatients who can tolerate the side effects, toxicities, and other \\ncomplications associated with the treatment regimens. As a consequence, \\nthere also is an increasing occurrence of HIV-associated comorbidities, \\nincluding cardiovascular, hepatic, metabolic, renal, neurologic, AIDS-\\ndefining, and non-AIDS defining malignancies, and other clinical \\ncomplications associated with long-term HIV disease and antiretroviral \\ntherapy. An overarching priority for the NIH HIV/AIDS research program \\nis the prevention and treatment of HIV-associated comorbidities and \\ncoinfections.\\n    The clinical challenges confronting HIV-infected patients on \\noptimal antiretroviral therapy is shifting from acute infectious \\ncomplications associated with HIV to chronic diseases, such as coronary \\nartery disease, chronic lung disease, and chronic anemia. By 2030, it \\nis estimated that 84 percent of the HIV population will have one or \\nmore co-morbidities, and 78 percent will have cardiovascular disease. \\nResearch findings also suggest that HIV-infected individuals are up to \\ntwice as likely as those without HIV to have cardiovascular disease, \\nyet this important public health issue remains understudied.

Please provide an update on the NIH Centers for \\nAccelerated Innovations (NCAI) program and any progress the initiative \\nhas made in addressing the gap in the commercialization pipeline \\nbetween scientific discovery and moving breakthrough innovations. Are \\nany NIH institutes considering hosting a similar concept with their \\nfunds?\\n    Answer. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) \\nestablished the NIH Centers for Accelerated Innovations (NCAI) as a \\npilot program to identify emerging technologies in the academic \\nlaboratory research setting and facilitate their transition into \\ncommercial products that can improve patient care and enhance health. \\nLaunched in September 2013, the three Centers merge the strengths of 15 \\nhigh-impact research institutions with expertise and resources from \\nboth Federal and private-sector partners. The NHLBI committed $35.5 \\nmillion over 7 years to the NCAI program, and the Centers have raised \\nnon-Federal matching capital to leverage this Federal investment.\\n    To accomplish their goals, NCAIs support proof-of-concept studies, \\neducate academics on the technology development process, and provide \\nearly access to the scientific and business expertise needed for \\ncommercialization. NCAIs provide early mentoring to innovators to \\ndevelop key business elements (legal, business development, regulatory, \\nreimbursement, access to partners and capital), which are often not \\nwell understood by academic scientists and are critical for commercial \\nsuccess of developed technologies. Innovator response to the program \\nhas been robust, and the Centers received a wide range of applications \\nto develop devices, therapeutics, diagnostics, and tools to address a \\nbroad spectrum of heart, vessel, lung, blood, and sleep disorder and \\ndiseases.\\n    Over the past year, efforts to address the gap in the \\ncommercialization pipeline between scientific discovery and \\ncommercialization were expanded in two ways. First, the National \\nInstitute on Drug Abuse joined the NCAI program and committed $3 \\nmillion to support innovator education and technologies targeted to \\nsubstance abuse at one of the three centers. Second, the NCAI model was \\nscaled across NIH through a new, 3-year trans-NIH, $9 million dollar \\nResearch Evaluation and Commercialization Hub program (REACH). Working \\nin concert, the NCAI and REACH programs will enable development of \\nself-sustaining biomedical technology development ecosystems that \\nencourage the conversion of laboratory discoveries into products and \\nservices and disseminate best practices for technology development to \\nother agencies, institutions, and regions across the Nation. NIH will \\nclosely evaluate both of these programs as they are completed. By \\nmoving innovative technologies into the private sector for patient \\nbenefit, this network will enhance the commercial outcomes of \\nfederally-funded research for health, societal, and economic benefit.\\n                            brain initiative\\n    Question. What has been the average amount of funding for grants \\nawarded to date through the BRAIN initiative?\\n    Answer. The average award amount for grants funded by NIH through \\nthe BRAIN Initiative is approximately $650,000 annually per award. Most \\nare 3-year grants.\\n    Question. Should the additional funding requested for BRAIN be \\nprovided in fiscal year 2016, would NIH expect to use a portion of \\nthese funds to support significantly larger awards to tackle bigger \\nchallenges facing the initiative?\\n    Answer. In short, yes. The BRAIN Initiative is focused on \\nunderstanding the functions of specific brain circuits, including \\ncircuits relevant to Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, recovery from \\ntraumatic brain injury and stroke, mental illnesses, and addiction. \\nUnderstanding this circuit functionality in the human brain is a \\ncritical goal highlighted by the external scientific advisors that \\ndeveloped BRAIN 2025, the roadmap for NIH's portion of the BRAIN \\nInitiative, and one that is echoed by the BRAIN Multi-Council Working \\nGroup, another group of esteemed external neuroscience experts that \\nprovides ongoing oversight of the long-term scientific vision of the \\nNIH BRAIN Initiative. This goal is also a major challenge facing the \\nInitiative, and starting in fiscal year 2016, NIH would like to greatly \\nexpand its BRAIN research investments on understanding human brain \\ncircuit function. Such research includes both invasive studies, which \\nwill make use of latest-generation brain stimulating and/or recording \\ndevices, as well as research with noninvasive devices for modulating \\nbrain function, which do not require surgery and do not penetrate the \\nbrain (for example, transcranial magnetic stimulation with a magnetic \\ncoil). These non-invasive devices are rapidly being developed and could \\nbecome an alternative or an adjunct to current therapies for various \\nbrain diseases and disorders.\\n    To support this expansion into human brain research, the awards are \\nlikely to be larger than prior NIH-funded BRAIN grants. This is partly \\ndue to the cost of doing research with human subjects, and partly \\nbecause NIH has focused much of its current BRAIN investment in smaller \\nplanning grants and other types of preliminary, exploratory awards \\naimed at developing new technologies and tools. Nevertheless, it will \\nbe important for NIH to continue supporting a wide range of BRAIN \\ninvestigators and while some awards will likely be larger as described, \\nNIH will still likely continue support of smaller, exploratory, high \\nrisk projects in various areas, under the continued direction of the \\nBRAIN Multi-Council Working Group.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n                Question Submitted by Senator Jack Reed\\n                              idea program\\n    Question. What is NIH doing through IDeA and other initiatives to \\nhelp States like Rhode Island become more competitive for Federal \\nresearch dollars so that we don't wind up concentrating our investments \\nin the same institutions and geographic areas?\\n    Answer. The Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program is \\ndesigned to enhance the research infrastructure and increase the \\nresearch capability and competitiveness of investigators in \\ninstitutions located in States with historically low aggregate grant \\nawards from NIH. Grant awards are made to independent biomedical \\nresearch institutions that award doctoral degrees in the health \\nsciences or sciences related to health within IDeA-eligible States and \\nto research institutes. The primary objectives of the IDeA program are \\nto develop research capacity and broaden the geographical distribution \\nof NIH funding, ensuring that cutting-edge biomedical research is \\nconducted throughout the Nation.\\n    The IDeA program continues to strive to meet its primary goal of \\nproviding for biomedical research capacity across all of the IDeA-\\neligible States and to distribute its resources broadly and \\nappropriately to support cutting edge biomedical research that serves \\nthe needs of the medically underserved populations in these regions. \\nThe program continues to support competing (new and renewal) and non-\\ncompeting Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) and IDeA \\nNetwork of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) awards that \\nconstitute the IDeA base. Additionally, support is provided for IDeA \\nProgram Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research (IDeA-\\nCTR) awards and continued co-funding of Independent Research Project \\n(R01 and R15) awards solicited from across the NIH Institutes and \\nCenters (ICs). In fiscal year 2015, the National Institute of General \\nMedical Sciences (NIGMS) supported 23 INBRE awards, 54 Phase I/II and \\n46 Phase III COBRE awards, and 5 IDeA-CTR awards. In fiscal year 2015, \\nIDeA co-funded 25 R01/R15 awards to 18 NIH ICs.\\n    NIH will continue to support new competing Phase I COBRE awards, as \\nwell as Phase II and Phase III COBRE awards. Funds will be provided to \\nsupport competing INBRE applications. Additionally, NIH anticipates \\nsupporting new IDeA-CTR awards.\\n    In terms of collaboration and shared funding from outside NIGMS \\nsources, NIH ICs are taking increasing interest in and are working with \\nthe IDeA program. For instance, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National \\nInstitute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is working with \\nIDeA program staff to develop two funding announcements to support \\nPediatric Clinical Research Networks in IDeA States. A proposed Data \\nCoordinating and Operations Center (DCOC) will support the activities \\nof the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Research Network (ISPCRN). The \\nfunded DCOC will cooperate with the IDeA Program Directors/Principal \\nInvestigators to train pediatric clinical trial teams. These teams will \\nutilize existing infrastructure and networks put in place by the IDeA \\nprogram in these States to support new research paradigms to address \\npediatric health, particularly in rural and underserved communities. \\nThese initiatives, developed by NICHD in conjunction with NIGMS, will \\nbe supported by funds from the NIH Office of the Director.\\n    IDeA program staff have engaged the Director of the Division of \\nExtramural Research at NIDCR in exploring ways to inform dental schools \\nin IDeA States about the funding opportunities for COBRE Phase I \\nawards. The possibilities discussed were a webinar or having \\ninformation available at the NIDCR booth in the dental research \\nmeeting. The NIDCR Director will consult with senior staff at that \\ninstitute.\\n    NIGMS and other ICs will continue to support, through co-funding, \\nmeritoriously reviewed research projects that have not made the pay \\nlines of the other ICs. The IDeA Director sends out solicitations to \\nall the ICs for meritorious applications for nomination of co-funding \\nby the IDeA program.\\n    Six IDeA States have Clinical and Translational Science Awards and \\ninstitutions in IDeA States continue to be eligible to compete for \\nthese awards. NIGMS is speaking with staff from the National Center for \\nAdvancing Translational Sciences to promote this idea.\\n    Lastly, NIGMS is also considering options to set up biotechnology \\naccelerators in each of the four IDeA regions to facilitate translating \\nbasic discoveries to marketplace, as directed by the Senate (Senate \\nLHHS report 2016, page 92).\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n              Questions Submitted by Senator Brian Schatz\\n                             tobacco to 21\\n    Question. Tobacco prevention and control is one of the most cost-\\neffective public health interventions we can use as policymakers to \\nprevent unnecessary tobacco deaths. In March, the Institute of Medicine \\nconcluded that raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco \\nproducts would result in 223,000 fewer premature deaths, 50,000 fewer \\ndeaths from lung cancer, and 4.2 million fewer years of life lost for \\nthose born between 2000 and 2019. It would also reduce tobacco \\ninitiation, especially among youth 15 to 17 years old. That's why I \\nintroduced S. 2100, the Tobacco to 21 Act with nine of my Senate \\ncolleagues, which would raise the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco \\nproducts to 21.\\n    The NIH has a Tobacco Regulatory Science Program that coordinates \\nthe trans-NIH collaborative effort with the FDA's Center for Tobacco \\nProducts to do research and support its tobacco regulatory activities. \\nI am also aware that the NIH funds numerous studies on tobacco and \\nnicotine use and their impacts on public health.\\n    I have two questions for Dr. Collins and Dr. Lowy, in particular, \\nregarding tobacco research:\\n      1. Has NIH studied the relationship between increasing the \\n        minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products and an \\n        improvement in public health? What were the results of that \\n        research? And what would you expect from increasing the minimum \\n        legal age of sale of tobacco products from 18 to 21?\\n      2. What are other demonstrated successes from a research \\n        perspective in the effort to prevent and control tobacco \\n        deaths? Do you have data on deaths averted and lives saved \\n        thanks to these preventive efforts, and/or data on cost-\\n        effectiveness of these efforts?\\n    Answer. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released the report, Public \\nHealth Implications of Raising the Minimum Age of Legal Access to \\nTobacco Products, in March 2015. The report was commissioned by the \\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) to specifically address the \\nquestions noted here in part a. That report used statistical modeling \\nand other methods to determine its findings. Specifically, the report \\nconcluded that, based on modeling, raising the age of legal access to \\ntobacco products, particularly to age 21 or 25, will likely lead to \\nsubstantial reductions in smoking prevalence and smoking related \\nmortality. The report also concluded that, based on a review of the \\nliterature and on modeling, that an increase in the minimum age of \\nlegal access to tobacco products will likely improve maternal, fetal, \\nand infant outcomes by reducing the likelihood of maternal and paternal \\nsmoking.\\n    One of the two statistical models that informed the IOM findings is \\nNCI's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) \\nsmoking population model, which simulates annual age-specific smoking \\nprevalence and smoking-attributable mortality. NCI also provided \\nsupport for the SimSmoke modeling of the potential impact of increasing \\nthe minimum age of sale on birth outcomes. As of this time, NCI has not \\nfunded other research on the potential impact of increasing the minimum \\nlegal age of sale of tobacco products. NCI concurs with the IOM \\nreport's findings that raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco \\nproducts would likely result in a reduction in the prevalence of \\ntobacco use and a reduction in disease, including cancers, caused by \\ntobacco use.\\n    NIH, including NCI and other Institutes and Centers, supports a \\nbroad-based portfolio of tobacco control and prevention research. This \\nresearch continues to contribute to the evidence base for understanding \\nand reducing tobacco use among youth and adults. Successful strategies \\nto reduce tobacco use include mass media campaigns, raising taxes on \\ntobacco products, comprehensive smoke-free air laws, efforts to promote \\nnon-smoking norms, and barrier free access to evidence-based smoking \\ncessation treatment. Over many decades, these and other programs and \\npolicies have contributed to substantially reducing smoking prevalence \\nand smoking-caused disease. For example, a study conducted by NCI \\nCISNET investigators estimated that twentieth-century tobacco control \\nprograms and policies averted nearly 800,000 deaths from lung cancer \\nbetween 1975 through 2000.\\\\6\\\\ Similarly, NCI supported researchers \\ndetermined that the long-running California tobacco control program \\nreduced smoking prevalence and per capita cigarette consumption; this \\nresearch also estimated that between 1989 and 2008, the California \\ntobacco control program cost $2.4 billion, but led to approximately \\n$134 billion in healthcare expenditures savings.\\\\7\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\6\\\\ Http://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/\\nTobaccoControlCISNET.\\n    \\\\7\\\\ Http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3572143/.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Despite significant progress in reducing the prevalence of tobacco \\nuse in the United States, and the incidence of tobacco related cancers, \\ntobacco use continues to represent a major threat to public health. In \\naddition, decreases in tobacco use have not been consistent across the \\npopulation and prevalence remains high among certain groups. For this \\nreason, NCI supports a broad range of research on the etiology, \\nprevention, treatment, and control of tobacco use.\\n    Additionally, within the framework of the Family Smoking Prevention \\nand Tobacco Control Act, signed into law in 2009, the NIH and FDA's \\nCenter for Tobacco Products (CTP) formed an interagency partnership to \\nfoster tobacco regulatory research. NIH biomedical, behavioral and \\nsocial sciences research supported in partnership with FDA is providing \\nthe scientific evidence needed to inform FDA's regulatory authorities.\\n    In collaboration with the NIH Tobacco Regulatory Science Program, \\nNCI is developing an evidence base to inform the FDA CTP regulatory \\nauthority over the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco \\nproducts in order to protect public health. Although a vast and sound \\nscientific evidence base exists to support the Tobacco Control Act, new \\nresearch will provide scientific evidence in several areas. This \\nincludes research to better understand e-cigarettes and other tobacco \\nproducts (initiation, use, perceptions, dependence, toxicity), and the \\nimpact of tobacco product characteristics on initiation, especially \\namong youth and other vulnerable populations.\\n                         telehealth and mhealth\\n    Question. As I've talked about before, I am a strong believer in \\nTelehealth, including mobileHealth or mHealth, and remote patient \\nmonitoring as a way to improve healthcare quality and access, and \\ndecrease costs.\\n    The VA, DOD, and private insurers have well defined protocols and \\nstandards for delivery of Telehealth. However, there are many \\nrestrictions on Medicare reimbursement of Telehealth in the 1834(m) \\nstatute under the Social Security Act which I am working with my \\ncolleagues to address.\\n    Dr. Collins, how is the NIH engaged on research to demonstrate the \\nefficacy and cost-effectiveness of Telehealth? What initiatives are you \\npursuing?\\n    Answer. Listed below are NIH activities related to Telehealth and \\nmHealth.\\n    NIH's Extramural activities--Telehealth, including mobile health \\n(mHealth), is well represented in the extramural funding of the various \\nNIH institutes and centers with over 200 awarded projects in fiscal \\nyear 2015. See selected examples below:\\n  --Randomized Trial of an Innovative Smartphone Intervention for \\n        Smoking Cessation.--With over 400 smoking cessation mobile \\n        applications being downloaded millions of times in the United \\n        States over 2012-2013, there is a need for systematic, rigorous \\n        evaluation of the effectiveness of cessation intervention \\n        trials. This randomized trial will utilize an approach, called \\n        Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), which has a dual focus \\n        on subjects increasing willingness to experience physical \\n        cravings, emotions, and thoughts that cue smoking while making \\n        values-guided committed behavior changes. If effective, the \\n        smartphone application will provide a cost-effective \\n        intervention with maximal population-level impact.\\n  --Perinatal Nurse Home Visiting Enhanced with mHealth Technology.--\\n        The Institute of Medicine, World Health Organization and \\n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognize that \\n        prenatal home visitation, which improves the well-being of \\n        mother and children, presents an opportunity to provide early \\n        intervention to reduce intimate partner violence (IPV), and the \\n        impact the exposure has on the children. This study will \\n        utilize mHealth technology which aims to increase the \\n        sensitivity of screening instruments and reduce communication \\n        barriers between nurses and clients regarding IPV, as well as \\n        enhance and standardize the implementation of IPV \\n        interventions.\\n  --A personal exposure and response monitoring system for pediatric \\n        asthma study.--This study will develop a button-sized device \\n        that can monitor asthma triggers (chemicals and particulate \\n        matter) and physiological signals of a child 24 hours a day. \\n        This system can potentially impact the epidemiological study of \\n        the pollution exposure-response relationship, and eventually \\n        the prevention of pediatric asthma. The project will bring \\n        together strengths in chemical sensors, particulate matter \\n        detectors, epidemiology, and digital health from different \\n        groups, as well as industry collaborators.\\n  --Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth \\n        technologies.--Despite the effectiveness of available \\n        psychosocial and pharmacological treatments to establish \\n        abstinence for patients with alcohol use disorder, the vast \\n        majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the \\n        first few months following treatment. The goals of this project \\n        are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a \\n        dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting \\n        alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk \\n        prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated \\n        mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through \\n        adaptive use of continuing care services.\\n    To facilitate rigorous research in mobile health, the Office of \\nBehavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) has engaged in a number \\nof funding opportunity announcements and training activities. For the \\npast few years, OBSSR has led a number of NIH mHealth training sessions \\nwhich bring together biomedical and behavioral researchers and computer \\nscientists and engineers to learn skills in developing and evaluating \\nmobile health applications. In fiscal year 2015, OBSSR, NIBIB, and \\nother partner institutes awarded a mobile health research resource to \\nthe University of California San Francisco (1U2CEB021881) that will \\nprovide researchers with a large test bed of mobile phone users and the \\nresources to encourage rigorous mobile health research. NIH also \\nrecently released a competitive supplement funding announcement to \\nencourage current NIH grantees to incorporate and test new mobile and \\nTelehealth technologies in their research.\\n    NIH Intramural Activities.--NIH's Center for Information Technology \\n(CIT) is one of the NIH Intramural Research Program leaders in \\nTelehealth and mHealth. CIT created an extensive Telehealth program for \\nNCI that connected a number of cancer centers in major hospitals in the \\nUnited States and abroad (e.g., Ireland and Jordan) to allow \\ncollaboration on difficult cancer cases. This system, called \\nTELESYNERGY\\x04, provided real time multi-center collaboration and \\nincluded high resolution imaging capability. In 2006, CIT adapted for \\nNIDDK, TELESYNERGY\\x04 to create a telemedicine clinic that runs in \\nconjunction with the Indian Health Service's Zuni Indian Hospital. This \\nclinic meets regularly, and NIH CIT provides technical support as \\nneeded.\\n    More recently, NIH CIT created mHealth iPad application called the \\nmICU Clinical Information System (CIS) App, which allows the NIH \\nCritical Care Medicine Department staff to quickly ascertain the status \\nof patients in their Critical Care Unit. This application has been \\napproved to be interfaced with the Clinical Center's Clinical Research \\nInformatics System (CRIS), so that it can go online when connected, \\nproviding a major upgrade in functionality to the CRIS system. Finally, \\nthe Radiation Research Program at NCI is interested in an updated \\nversion of TELESYNERGY\\x04 that can be deployed via an iPad to physicians \\nin rural areas or undeveloped countries. These iPads would connect to \\nservers in the closest major hospitals and provide physicians access to \\nmore specialized diagnosis and treatment options that might not \\notherwise be available. NIH CIT also is beginning to develop two new \\nmHealth applications, an iPad App for the Connectome project in \\ncollaboration NINDS and an iPhone App, to study teen driving habits \\nwith NICHD.\\n    A number of other ICs have started or are planning to start \\nprograms in these areas. On October 22, 2015, NIH had its first mHealth \\nInterest Group meeting. There is a great deal of enthusiasm in this new \\ninterest group. Roughly 14 NIH ICs have expressed an interest in \\nparticipation in this newly formed group.\\n    NIDA Intramural Research Program Treatment Section aims to realize \\nthe full breadth of possibilities for mHealth, seeking results that can \\napply not only to substance-use disorders, but to any health condition \\nwith behavioral and environmental-exposure components. Methods for \\nambulatory assessment combine real-time self-report, continuous \\nphysiological monitoring, and continuous geospatial tracking; this \\ncombination places individual behavior in the context of the social and \\nbuilt environment. These efforts have already shown both expected and \\nunexpected relationships between neighborhood surroundings and \\nemotional/behavioral States. These findings can inform scientific \\ntheory about addiction and other psychiatric disorders, as well as the \\nimplementation and evaluation of public-health policies. NIDA is now \\nfocusing on methods that can predict the immediate behavioral future \\n(for example, risk of lapse to drug misuse or HIV-transmitting \\nbehaviors) based on input that poses the least possible burden to the \\nuser (for example, GPS tracks rather than frequent self-reports). These \\nfuture-prediction methods could be the basis of treatment interventions \\nthat are automatically triggered by and delivered through smartphones, \\nexactly when and where they are needed. NIDA has a patent application \\nsubmitted for prediction methods. In collaboration with the Biomedical \\nInformatics Section, NIDA also has developed and tested a program to \\ndeliver HIV-risk reduction education via smartphone.\\n                              walkability\\n    Question. Dr. Collins I'd like to ask about NIH's research \\nregarding the physical and mental health impacts of walkable, livable \\ncommunities. Last fall a researcher presented the results of a study \\nfunded by the National Institute on Aging, administered through the \\nUniversity of Kansas Alzheimer's Disease Center that suggests towns \\ndesigned to promote walking can actually blunt cognitive decline in \\nolder adults. In addition to mental health benefits it has been \\nsuggested that cities planned to be ``age-friendly'' can reduce \\npedestrian fatalities, increase exercise and increase opportunities for \\nsocialization and community involvement across all age groups. Can you \\nprovide a summary of NIH's body of research on the impact of a person's \\nbuilt environment on his or her mental and/or physical health? Can you \\nprovide an update about any ongoing studies NIH is funding or \\nparticipating in regarding the impact of a person's built environment \\non his or her mental and/or physical health? Earlier this year the \\nWashington Post reported on a trend by physicians to prescribe physical \\nactivity to combat certain mental and physical ailments. Has the NIH \\nstudied the efficacy of this type of treatment compared to prescription \\ndrug interventions?\\n    Answer. Research on the effect of the ``built environment''--the \\nphysical environment in which humans function--on health and well-being \\nhas long been of interest to several NIH Institutes and Centers. For \\nexample, in 2004, the National Institute of Environmental Health \\nSciences (NIEHS) hosted the ``Obesity & the Built Environment: \\nImproving Public Health Through Community Design'' conference that \\nbrought together partner researchers, planners, healthcare providers, \\ndevelopers, policy makers, and community and business leaders. More \\nrecently, in 2009, NIEHS hosted the third and final meeting of grantees \\nin the Obesity and Built Environment (OBE) Program. A key aim of the \\nmeeting was how modifiable aspects of the built environment can \\ninfluence overweight and obesity among residents and how those factors \\nmay be manipulated to improve public health.\\n    Some NIEHS-supported research has indicated that older individuals \\nwho live in neighborhoods with more ``walkability'' experience a slower \\nrate of decline in leg strength. Small park areas in neighborhoods seem \\nto increase physical activity of families with children, and children \\nwho live in neighborhoods with more trees are generally more physically \\nactive.\\n    The National Institute on Aging supports a number of studies on \\naging and the built environment, with studies on how physical \\nsurroundings influence mobility, health, and wellbeing. The Eunice \\nKennedy Shriver National Institute on Child Health and Human \\nDevelopment has supported research on potential associations between \\naspects of the built environment and childhood obesity, and the \\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute supports studies on the \\ninfluence of the physical environment on exercise behaviors, health, \\nand function.\\n    A few of the many currently active studies in this area include:\\n  --A study investigating the relationship between physical exercise \\n        and depression risk in older adults, as well as the influence \\n        of the neighborhood environment on both of these factors. The \\n        research team is also evaluating the impact of a program to \\n        improve pedestrian safety for older adults that will be \\n        implemented in 10 neighborhoods within the study area over the \\n        course of the project (R01 MH085132-05).\\n  --A study examining the relationships between neighborhoods built \\n        environment, use of physician services, and preventable \\n        hospitalizations and emergency department visits among elderly, \\n        chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries in an urban environment \\n        (K01 AG039463-05).\\n  --A project to link data on neighborhood characteristics with \\n        longitudinal data on cognitive function assessed in a \\n        nationally representative sample of older adults in the Health \\n        and Retirement Study This study will also examine potential \\n        mediators of this relationship, as well as factors that may \\n        inform pathways by which neighborhoods influence cognitive \\n        outcomes, and will identify subgroups that are most vulnerable \\n        to neighborhood effects based on sociodemographic and genetic \\n        characteristics (R01 AG043960-03).\\n  --A study drawing on data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of \\n        Atherosclerosis and the Study of Women's Health Across the \\n        Nation to improve knowledge about physical and cognitive \\n        functioning and their decline over time in the context of the \\n        neighborhood environment, with special emphasis on social and \\n        physical aspects of neighborhoods, and to elucidate how \\n        neighborhood environments contribute to race/ethnic and \\n        socioeconomic status disparities in function (K01 AG039554-05).\\n  --Studies funded under the Transdisciplinary Research on Energetics \\n        and Cancer initiative that investigate mechanisms by which \\n        built environment features and policies impact physical \\n        activity and obesity and influence carcinogenesis across the \\n        lifespan (U54 CA155626, U54 CA155435, U54 CA155850, U54 \\n        CA155496, U01 CA116850).\\n  --The Healthy Communities Study, a national study of community-based \\n        initiates, environment characteristics, and family and child \\n        factors that influence childhood diet, weight, and physical \\n        activity (BAA NHLBI-HB-10-15).\\n  --Studies of the effects of mass transit availability, including bus \\n        and light rail, on physical activity and health outcomes \\n        (Several from NCI and NIDDK)\\n    NIH has studied physical activity and exercise to prevent and treat \\na variety of diseases and conditions. One prominent example is the \\nDiabetes Prevention Program, which found that both lifestyle changes \\n(diet and exercise) and treatment with the drug metformin reduced the \\nincidence of diabetes in persons at high risk; however, the lifestyle \\nintervention was more effective than metformin--particularly among \\nstudy participants over age 60. At the 10 year follow-up, the \\ninvestigators found that incidences in the former placebo and metformin \\ngroups fell to equal those in the former lifestyle group, but the \\ncumulative incidence of diabetes remained lowest in the lifestyle \\ngroup. Prevention or delay of diabetes with lifestyle intervention or \\nmetformin can persist for at least 10 years.\\n    Other studies comparing physical activity or exercise to \\nprescription drug interventions include:\\n  --The MS FLASH (Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for \\n        Symptoms and Health) suite of studies tested promising \\n        treatments, mostly non-hormonal, for the most common symptoms \\n        of menopause (e.g., hot flashes and night sweats). \\n        Investigators found that yoga did not improve hot flash \\n        frequency or severity; however, participants reported an \\n        improvement in quality of life.\\n  --An ongoing study is comparing changes in bone strength at the hip \\n        and spine in women who take 12 months of either: 1) optimal \\n        calcium and vitamin D alone; 2) bisphosphonate risedronate with \\n        calcium and vitamin D; or 3) a bone-loading exercise program \\n        with calcium and vitamin D.\\n    In addition, exercise is being studied as an adjunct to standard \\ntreatment for a number of conditions, including cognitive decline and \\nAlzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and \\narthritis.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n                Questions Submitted to Dr. Douglas Lowy\\n               Questions Submitted by Senator Jerry Moran\\n                     nci designated cancer centers\\n    Question. As many people know, those of us in Kansas are very proud \\nof the research conducted at the University of Kansas and felt a sense \\nof pride when the KU Cancer Center was recognized as a ``National \\nCancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center'' in June 2012. I understand \\nthat many NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, including KU, have community \\npartners to help expand their reach and to ensure that a broader \\npopulation has access to clinical research. Can you explain how that \\nmodel works, and if this is a standard approach of NCI-designated \\ncancer centers?\\n    Answer. NCI and NIH share your commitment to ensuring cancer \\npatients have access to NCI-supported clinical trials. Earlier this \\nyear, NCI's-designated Cancer Centers Program added its 69th \\ninstitution, and four other centers were awarded the comprehensive \\ndesignation. Much of the work these centers do is collaborative, often \\nwith researchers at other NCI-designated cancer centers as well as with \\nsmaller hospitals and community clinics.\\n    NCI-designated cancer centers and many community hospitals around \\nthe country are part of the network of institutions that comprise NCI's \\ntwo major clinical research programs: the National Clinical Trials \\nNetwork (NCTN) and the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP). \\nNCTN and NCORP form a network of 2,400 clinical sites that covers most \\nof the United States, ensuring that patients, regardless of where they \\nlive, have access to trials that are testing the latest in cancer \\nprevention, early detection, treatment, and survivorship care.\\n    The overall goal of NCORP is to bring cancer clinical trials and \\ncancer care delivery research to individuals in their own communities, \\nand to contribute to improved patient outcomes and a reduction in \\ncancer disparities. NCI supports 53 NCORP sites across the country, \\nincluding two sites in Kansas--the Wichita NCORP and the Kansas City \\nNCORP. These 53 community sites and research bases extend their reach \\neven further through a network of 840 component sites--local cancer \\ncenters, hospitals, and clinics that are affiliated with the NCORP \\nnetwork and make NCI-supported clinical trials available in a community \\nsetting. For example, in Kansas, the Wichita and Kansas City NCORPs \\ninclude 24 component sites across the State.\\n    NCTN was designed to respond rapidly to new and emerging scientific \\nopportunities. Foremost among these opportunities are precision \\nmedicine clinical trials--a new generation of clinical studies focused \\non developing molecularly targeted and immune-based therapies. The \\nmajority of NCTN's lead sites are located within NCI-designated cancer \\ncenters, and many NCORP sites collaborate with NCI-designated cancer \\ncenters through their participation in NCTN. NCORP facilitates patient \\nand provider access to treatment and imaging trials from the NCTN, and \\ncontributed substantially to patient accrual to NCTN trials. For \\nexample, 240 affiliates of 13 NCORP sites accounted for seventy percent \\nof all sites preregistered to the NCI Molecular Analysis for Therapy \\nChoice (MATCH) precision medicine trial launched in August 2015.\\n    Additionally, NCI supports the Partnerships to Advance Cancer \\nHealth Equity (PACHE) program, which enables NCI-designated cancer \\ncenters and institutions serving health disparity populations and \\nunderrepresented students to conduct research in cancer and cancer \\nhealth disparities, train scientists from diverse backgrounds, and \\neffectively deliver cancer advances to underserved communities. NCI \\ncurrently funds twenty PACHE partnerships.\\n    The NCI-designated Cancer Centers Program, NCTN, and NCORP form the \\nfoundation of NCI's clinical research efforts and are critical in \\nbrining NCI-supported clinical trials to patients in their own \\ncommunities. The continued growth of the Cancer Centers Program, and \\nthe partnerships it fosters, is essential to the success of the \\nNational Cancer Program.\\n                         nci precision medicine\\n    Question. Dr. Lowy, what do you envision for how the NCI will \\nfacilitate the NIH's precision medicine initiative? Is there potential \\nfor supplemental Cancer Center Support Grant awards to implement \\nprecision medicine initiatives like the MATCH trial?\\n    Answer. Cancer presents an exceptionally promising opportunity to \\nrefine the principles and practices that will serve as the foundation \\nfor precision medicine. The additional funding associated with the \\nprecision medicine initiative (PMI) will allow NCI to expand the NCI-\\nMATCH study. This expansion will include the addition of new \\ngenetically targeted therapies to which patients can be matched and an \\nincrease in the number of genetic alterations included in the study. \\nMATCH is implemented through the NCI Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), a \\ngroup that is formally connected to many NCI-designated cancer centers \\nby their designation as ``lead academic participating sites'' or \\n``LAPS'' sites. All NCI-designated cancer centers and all NCI's \\nCommunity Oncology Research Program (NCORP) sites can enroll patients \\ninto the MATCH study. PMI funding will also accelerate planning for the \\nPediatric MATCH study. NCI will continue to provide details and updates \\nto the committee on established NCI programs in precision oncology and \\nthe status of NCI progress related to the new and expanded activities \\nunder the fiscal year 2016 Precision Medicine Initiative.\\n    The 69 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers form the backbone of NCI's \\nprograms for studying and controlling cancer, and they will be \\ncritically involved in precision medicine initiatives at every stage of \\nthe research continuum. NCI's PMI efforts will be focused on further \\ndeveloping and expanding research in the following areas:\\n  --Evolution of a new standard for clinical trials in which the \\n        molecular characterization of cancers becomes the clinical \\n        standard for accurate diagnosis and treatment. This requires \\n        identifying or developing an array of treatments that can be \\n        matched to the molecular features of a tumor to successfully \\n        control the disease, overcoming drug resistance in cancer \\n        treatment. The goal is to develop cancer models from tissues \\n        obtained at the time of diagnosis and at relapse to uncover \\n        mechanisms of resistance to treatment. This involves analyzing \\n        tumor DNA and tumor cells circulating in blood samples to \\n        develop methods to predict relapse before this problem is \\n        identified clinically or in radiologic studies. It also \\n        includes testing combinations of targeted agents in clinical \\n        trials.\\n  --Development of new laboratory models for research by greatly \\n        increasing the number of human cancer cell lines available, as \\n        well as the number of patient-derived tumor xenografts--model \\n        systems developed by transplanting a patient's tumor cells into \\n        laboratory mice. Providing these and other tools to researchers \\n        to gain new insights into tumor biology and better predict \\n        patients' responses to cancer treatment.\\n  --Development of a national cancer knowledge system to support \\n        precision medicine by building an information platform. This \\n        would support the integration of genetic information about \\n        tumors with data on how the tumors respond to therapy, and \\n        incorporate genetic, biochemical, environmental and clinical \\n        data from patients to define molecular subtypes and to identify \\n        the approaches to cancer care that will improve patient \\n        outcomes.\\n    NCI will work to achieve these goals by using its existing \\ninfrastructure such as the NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, the NCTN, and \\nthe NCORP, which supports consortia of community hospitals, oncology \\npractices, and integrated healthcare systems across the country. This \\nprogram includes a specific focus on underserved populations, with \\ntwelve NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Sites with patient \\npopulations comprised of at least thirty percent racial/ethnic \\nminorities or rural residents. NCI also supports a partnership program \\nbetween NCI-designated cancer centers and institutions serving \\nunderserved health disparity populations that aims to train scientists \\nfrom diverse backgrounds in cancer research and to effectively deliver \\ncancer advances to underserved communities.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n                Questions Submitted by Senator Mark Kirk\\n                     stomach cancer in young people\\n    Question. I am gravely concerned about the rise of stomach cancer \\nin young people. This recalcitrant cancer hides until it is late stage \\nand is deadly when metastatic; only 4 percent survive when diagnosed at \\nlate stage. The research investment for this cancer is severely lacking \\nand the science is not as advanced as it is for other cancers. I hear \\nfrom stomach cancer researchers that it is very difficult for them to \\nget funded in the competitive grants environment and that the lack of \\nfunding is deterring investors from the field of stomach cancer \\nresearch altogether.\\n    It is my understanding that promising stomach cancer data is \\navailable from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). What is the NCI doing to \\ntranslate TCGA-generated knowledge to actual advances for stomach \\ncancer patients, for whom there is a lack of effective treatments? \\nWhile I understand the promise of the NCI MATCH Trial, researchers tell \\nme it will have limited utility for stomach cancer.\\n    Answer. NCI is committed to full exploration of the data from The \\nCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and similar projects to advance genomic \\nresearch and translate findings into the clinic to improve the precise \\ndiagnosis and treatment of cancers such as gastric cancer. NCI supports \\na wide range of basic research projects and clinical trials on gastric \\ncancer, including five Specialized Programs of Research Excellence \\n(SPORES) focused on gastrointestinal cancers such as stomach, \\nesophagus, and colon cancers. NCI is currently sponsoring several \\nclinical trials for gastric and gastro-esophageal (GE) cancers. \\nExamples include a study of combination chemotherapy for gastric \\ncancer, a study of a targeted therapy with personalized antibodies for \\nGE cancer, and a phase II study of a drug that inhibits tumor growth \\nreceptors for advanced esophageal gastric cancer. In addition, NCI's \\nNational Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) is currently supporting several \\ntrials for gastric cancer, including a trial of combination therapy for \\ngastric cancers with high hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) \\nexpression, as well evaluating whether the addition of molecularly-\\ntargeted therapies can enhance the survival of patients treated with \\ncombinations of traditional surgical, radiation, and chemotherapeutic \\napproaches. It is too early to tell what the NCI MATCH Trial will yield \\nfor any particular cancer type, and there are several applicable \\ntargets for gastric cancer, including human epidermal growth factor \\nreceptor 2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and \\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV).\\n    Sequencing data from TCGA has enabled the extensive \\ncharacterization of cancer genomes as well as associated analyses \\nacross cancer types that have shown that some cancer subtypes may be \\nmore similar to each other than to others from the same organ-of-\\norigin. These analyses (called Pan-Can analyses) have also shown that \\nthese cancer types also might share common genetic features that could \\nbe susceptible to some targeted therapies on the market, but not yet \\nconsidered for the particular subtype. In other words, seemingly \\ndissimilar cancer types may share a vulnerability for which a drug is \\nalready available. NCI is supporting new projects to expand on these \\nanalyses and to enable researchers to examine a variety of new research \\nhypotheses in this area.\\n    NCI is also supporting the development of new cancer models, \\nincluding gastric cancer models, sometimes referred to as ``organoid'' \\ncultures and ``conditionally reprogrammed'' cells. NCI has completed a \\npilot program in the development of these organoid models and is co-\\nleading an international consortium effort for broad development of \\nmodels for many cancer types. When successful, NCI will distribute \\nthese new cancer models broadly to cancer researchers to help develop \\ndiagnostic and treatment strategies tailored to specific subtypes of \\ncancer and to specific molecular abnormalities.\\n    Question. Additionally, if stomach cancer researchers have \\ndifficulty competing for research grants because the knowledge base of \\nstomach cancer is lacking, what can NCI do to help level the playing \\nfield?\\n    Answer. NCI's investment in TCGA and a pilot study specifically to \\nobtain biospecimens for gastric cancer has enabled more successful \\napplications focused on gastric cancer research. The success rate for \\nall gastric cancer grant applications (both new and competing) ranged \\nfrom 16 percent and 46 percent between fiscal years 2010-2014, with the \\nhighest gastric cancer success rate to date was in fiscal year 2014, \\nwith 46 percent of gastric cancer applications being funded. The \\naverage success rate for all NCI grant applications during this time \\nperiod ranged 12-14 percent.\\n    Results from TCGA analyses to date have led to more than 3,000 \\narticles in research journals. Data from TCGA has not only generated a \\nlarge number of publications, it has also stimulated many new research \\nproposals, many of which have been funded. To date, NIH has received \\nover 3,000 grant applications utilizing TCGA data, and the success rate \\nfor these applications has been above the NIH average. NCI will \\ncontinue to support promising research proposals that address important \\nscientific questions, and will use the breadth of funding mechanisms \\navailable to support both individual and team science approaches. \\nProjects like TCGA are providing a new classification framework focused \\non the genetic abnormalities of cancer that has the potential to alter \\ndiagnostic categories, enhance treatment strategies, enable early \\ndetection and prevention, and improve outcomes for all patients. NCI is \\nseeking innovative research proposals to advance these goals through a \\nvariety of funding opportunity announcements.\\\\8\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\8\\\\ Http://deais.nci.nih.gov/foastatus/RFA-PA.jsp.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Question. Researchers and patients alike tell me a dedicated \\nfunding stream, such as a through a RFA for stomach cancer, would help \\nto bridge the research gap and give hope to the many young people who \\nhave or will be diagnosed with stomach cancer. Is this something NCI \\ncould consider to assist these patients?\\n    Answer. NCI is fostering many opportunities to study gastric \\n(stomach) cancer via several different types of funding opportunity \\nannouncements (FOAs) supporting a wide variety of investigator-\\ninitiated research applications ranging from basic studies of cancer \\netiology and structural biology to studies of early detection and \\nbiomarkers and clinical trials. An ``RFA'' (request for applications) \\nis a specific funding mechanism with set-aside funds that is typically \\nutilized for defined research areas, and one that may be appropriate in \\nthe future for specific gastric cancer research projects. NCI is also \\nsupporting training opportunities for talented individuals who might \\ndevelop an interest in gastric cancer through individual fellowships, \\ninstitutional training awards, and career development awards; and NCI \\nprogram managers are available to provide guidance to investigators who \\nseek help in finding the most appropriate funding mechanisms to support \\nproposed work on gastric cancer and other types of cancers.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n                Question Submitted by Senator Jack Reed\\n                            childhood cancer\\n    Question. Director Douglas Lowy, National Cancer Institute--\\nChildhood Cancer: In July, I introduced the Childhood Cancer \\nSurvivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act, along with my \\ncolleague on the Subcommittee, Senator Capito. The legislation would \\nexpand opportunities for childhood cancer research, improve efforts to \\nidentify and track childhood cancer incidences, and enhance the quality \\nof life for childhood cancer survivors. As you know, cancer remains the \\nleading cause of death by disease among our children--and while \\nresearch supported by NIH and NCI is leading to progress, we still have \\na long way to go. What do you see as the most promising research \\nopportunities in this area, and what is NCI doing to support these \\nefforts?\\n    Answer. NCI is committed to advancing research on all fronts to \\nbenefit children with cancer--from basic science to preclinical \\nstudies, translational research, and clinical trials, as well as \\nefforts focused on survivorship, quality of life, and psychosocial \\ncare. This work is represented by key investments across our extramural \\nportfolio, at cancer centers and institutions across the country, as \\nwell as through NCI's Pediatric Oncology Branch at the NIH Clinical \\nCenter.\\n    These priorities include a new 5-year commitment to NCI's Pediatric \\nPreclinical Testing Consortium and significant investments in NCI's \\nChildren's Oncology Group to support pediatric clinical trials, \\nincluding the NCI Pediatric Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice \\n(Pediatric MATCH) trial. Pediatric MATCH will provide a tremendous \\nopportunity to test a range of molecularly targeted therapies in \\nchildren with advanced cancers who have few other treatment options. \\nWith the genomic data captured in the trial, it will also produce an \\ninvaluable resource for studying the genetic basis of relapse in \\npediatric cancers. Through the Children's Oncology Group, NCI is also \\nsupporting nationwide clinical trials introducing new immunotherapy \\nagents into evaluation for children with cancer and clinical trials \\nevaluating precision medicine concepts in children with newly diagnosed \\nlymphomas and leukemias.\\n    In addition to these efforts, NCI has prioritized the development \\nof new treatments for pediatric cancer in the NCI Experimental \\nTherapeutics (NExT) Program.\\\\9\\\\ This program focuses on advancing \\nbreakthrough discoveries in basic and clinical research into new \\ntherapies, and several new inhibitors with potential to treat pediatric \\ncancer are being studied for this purpose.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\9\\\\ Http://next.cancer.gov/about/mission.htm.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    NCI's translational research efforts include a recently awarded a \\nSpecialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) award focusing on \\nneurofibromatosis type 1 and related cancers in children and \\nadolescents and young adults. This award is exciting for a number of \\nreasons. This is the first SPORE grant that is non-organ specific, and \\ninstead targets a pathway--known as the RAS pathway. SPORE grants are \\nalso typically awarded to a single institution, and this effort is \\ncollaboration across institutions--including the University of \\nCalifornia San Francisco, Indiana University, the University of \\nAlabama, and the Johns Hopkins University. The effort will also include \\na focus on cancer survivorship and understanding how chemotherapy and \\nradiation promote the development of second cancers--a critical issue \\nfor pediatric and adult cancer survivors.\\n    Childhood cancer survivorship research continues to be a priority \\nfor NCI. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, launched by NCI more than \\ntwo decades ago, is a critical resource for investigators conducting \\nsurvivorship research, as well as for clinicians making treatment \\ndecisions and delivering survivorship care. NCI also supports a \\ncomplementary effort, the St. Jude Lifetime study, which will allow for \\nreplication of findings from genomic studies and the development of \\ncollaborative projects to refine risk-based follow-up guidelines and \\nimprove outcomes among childhood cancer survivors.\\n    NCI continues to support new research opportunities and \\ncollaborations in pediatric oncology. In February 2015, NCI brought \\ntogether dozens of experts to identify critical gaps in our knowledge \\nabout the genetic changes underlying childhood cancers.\\\\10\\\\ The \\nChildhood Cancer Genomics Gaps and Opportunities workshop included \\nresearchers and clinicians, members of regulatory agencies, and \\nadvocates for research on childhood cancers. A full summary of the \\nworkshop is available on NCI's website.\\\\11\\\\ Participants continue to \\ncollaborate to pursue opportunities identified at the workshop, and the \\nworkshop discussions also informed NCI's decision to support \\nProvocative Questions (PQ) meetings focused specifically on pediatric \\ncancers.\\\\12\\\\ NCI's PQ initiative aims to promote cancer research on \\nimportant yet understudied areas or research questions that have proven \\ndifficult to address. NCI launched the PQ effort in 2011 to build on \\nspecific advances in cancer biology and cancer control, and to address \\ncritical questions about cancer biology that were largely unresolved. \\nThe questions are generated from the cancer research community through \\nNCI-sponsored interactive workshops with researchers. Two of the most \\nrecent PQ workshops took place in November 2015 and focused exclusively \\non identifying questions to advance pediatric oncology research.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\10\\\\ Http://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2015/\\nchildhood-genomic-workshop.\\n    \\\\11\\\\ Http://www.cancer.gov/types/childhood-cancers/research/\\nchildhood-genomics-workshop-summary.pdf.\\n    \\\\12\\\\ Http://provocativequestions.nci.nih.gov/.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    We agree that the current outlook for children with cancer and \\ntheir families is not acceptable--and NCI is committed to doing more to \\nidentify promising new therapies for children, bring these therapies to \\nthe clinic, improve the outlook for childhood cancer survivors, and \\nsupport the foundation of basic research needed to achieve all of these \\ngoals.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n              Question Submitted to Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers\\n                Question Submitted by Senator Roy Blunt\\n                             kidney disease\\n    Question. Dr. Rodgers, Medicare provides care for every American \\nwith kidney failure, regardless of age. This is an incredibly expensive \\nendeavor and a good example of how research could slow the progression \\nof the disease or help develop more cost-effective treatments for those \\nwith kidney disease. Research would have both huge health benefits and \\ncost savings for the U.S. taxpayer. Could you update the Committee on \\nyour Institute's latest efforts in kidney research?\\n    Answer. Yes, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and \\nKidney Diseases (NIDDK) is vigorously supporting research to identify \\ncauses of kidney diseases, slow or stop disease progression, develop \\ntreatments, and prevent kidney diseases and kidney failure in adults \\nand children. For example, results from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency \\nCohort Study, which is evaluating long-term cardiovascular risk and \\noutcomes of over 3,700 persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD), \\nshowed that systolic blood pressure levels above 130 mmHg -below the \\ncurrent guideline threshold of 140 mmHg--is associated with worse \\nkidney outcomes. Building on the importance of blood pressure control, \\nthe NHLBI-led and NIDDK-supported Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention \\nTrial (SPRINT) is examining the effects of intensive blood pressure \\ncontrol on the development of kidney disease, and results are expected \\nto be reported in November 2015.\\n    NIDDK is also studying children with mild to moderately decreased \\nkidney function in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study. \\nThe study is examining risk factors for further kidney decline, as well \\nas investigating risk factors for heart disease, closely monitoring \\nbrain development, and following long-term effects of poor growth in \\nthis group. The study has already found that growth is relatively \\nstunted in lower-income youth with kidney disease. In a related effort, \\nNIDDK is supporting the planning phase of a trial of phosphate binders \\nto treat children with bone disease as a result of their CKD.\\n    NIDDK established and is recruiting participants for the CKD Pilot \\nTrials Consortium to help advance possible new CKD therapies. A current \\nclinical trial is testing whether the generic drug allopurinol could \\npreserve kidney function in people with type 1 diabetes who are at high \\nrisk of kidney disease; if the result is positive, it could represent a \\nlow cost approach to prevent kidney disease in this population and \\npotentially in people with type 2 diabetes. NIDDK also renewed a \\nconsortium to promote the discovery and validation of CKD biomarkers. \\nBiomarkers could allow earlier detection of disease and thus facilitate \\nearlier treatment, and also enable clinicians and researchers to \\nmeasure responses to therapy.\\n    An ongoing effort related to kidney dialysis is a large, pragmatic \\nclinical trial comparing the effect of adding 30 minutes to the usual \\n(3.5 hour) duration of dialysis treatments for new dialysis patients. \\nThe trial will determine if the extra dialysis time increases survival, \\nreduces hospitalizations, and improves health-related quality of life. \\nNIDDK also is leading Improving Chronic Disease Management with Pieces \\n(ICD-Pieces), which is a trial in four large healthcare systems that is \\ntesting a novel health information technology (HIT) approach to reduce \\nhospitalizations in people with CKD, hypertension, and diabetes.\\n    To increase knowledge about nephrotic syndrome, a kidney disorder \\nthat can be caused by a number of diseases, NIDDK recently expanded the \\nNephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) observational study, which \\nnow includes a specific pediatric component. NEPTUNE is investigating \\nthe underlying causes of nephrotic syndrome, toward identifying new \\ntherapeutic targets. Complementing NEPTUNE, the new Cure Glomerulopathy \\nNetwork consortium will conduct translational and clinical research to \\nbetter understand the causes, treatments, and progression of several \\nforms of kidney disease. The Network is recruiting 2,400 patients, of \\nwhich at least 25 percent will be children. NIDDK also supports the \\nAssessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae of Acute Kidney \\nInjury (ASSESS-AKI) study, which will provide important information \\nabout the natural history of AKI and recovery.\\n    Recent findings from major NIH trials and studies are providing \\nnovel insights about genetic contributions to the increased risk of \\nnon-diabetic kidney disease in African Americans. For example, \\nresearchers in the SPRINT study found that variants in the APOL1 gene \\nare associated with increased risk of kidney disease, but not \\ncardiovascular disease, in African American participants with high \\nblood pressure. Additionally, results of a study leveraging five NIH-\\nsupported cohort studies suggest that sickle cell trait may be related \\nto the higher risk of kidney disease in African Americans. These \\ninsights can help identify ways to reduce the burden that kidney \\ndisease places on this population.\\n    To inform future directions for kidney disease research, the NIDDK \\nspearheaded a Kidney Research National Dialogue, engaging kidney \\ndisease researchers in a discussion to identify research strategies \\nthat would improve understanding of normal kidney function and the \\nmechanisms underlying kidney disease. The ideas that arose from these \\ndiscussions were distilled and published in a series of commentaries--\\nmaking them available to the broader community interested in kidney \\ndisease research. Complementing that effort, the Institute has also \\nsponsored several recent scientific conferences and workshops that are \\ninforming future research directions related to kidney diseases. Topics \\nof recent meetings included overcoming barriers in AKI, APOL1 and \\nkidney disease, urinary stones, and the use of health information \\ntechnology to identify and manage CKD populations.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n              Questions Submitted by Senator Patty Murray\\n                      diabetes prevention research\\n    Question. NIDDK strongly supported the development and testing of \\nthe Diabetes Prevention Program. The Diabetes Prevention Program helps \\noverweight participants with pre-diabetes to become physically active \\nand lose weight. In multiple trials, participants have become more \\nactive, lost weight, and reduced the onset of diabetes in at-risk \\npopulations by about 60 percent. The YMCA estimates that 30 percent of \\nadults could benefit from participation in the Diabetes Prevention \\nProgram, yet real-world participation is disappointingly low. What kind \\nof research is NIDDK conducting to learn how to increase participation \\nin the program?\\n    Answer. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney \\nDiseases (NIDDK) is pursuing several areas of research that could help \\nincrease participation in the National Diabetes Prevention Program \\n(NDPP). NDPP is a public health program led by the Centers for Disease \\nControl and Prevention (CDC) that is based on NIDDK-supported research: \\nthe original NIDDK-led Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical \\ntrial, as well as a subsequent NIDDK-supported pilot study showing that \\nlocal Ys could be used to deliver a lower-cost, group-based adaptation \\nof the DPP lifestyle intervention. CDC launched the NDPP based on \\nresults of the pilot study, but it was important to have a larger and \\nlonger-term study to provide more definitive evidence for delivery \\nthrough local Ys. NIDDK funded that recently published study, which \\nshowed that using the Ys to deliver the DPP lifestyle intervention \\nachieved meaningful weight loss at 12 months in low-income adults. \\nThrough its Centers for Diabetes Translation Research program, NIDDK \\nalso supported research showing that implementation of a group-based \\nDPP lifestyle program adapted for American Indian/Alaska Native \\ncommunities--populations disproportionately affected by type 2 \\ndiabetes--prevented or delayed onset of the disease. This study \\ndemonstrated the feasibility of using a DPP-based lifestyle \\nintervention in these communities, which can inform future public \\nhealth efforts to recruit and retain participants. Additionally, NIDDK \\nsupported a small business grant to Omada Health for online delivery of \\nthe DPP lifestyle intervention; the online program is now NDPP-\\ncertified (https://preventnow.com/). Having an online option could help \\nreach more people, particularly those who may not live near an in-\\nperson program or have schedules that permit in-person participation.\\n    NIDDK also supports behavioral research that could inform efforts \\ntoward increasing participation in the NDPP, such as a pilot study \\nspecifically seeking to increase NDPP recruitment, group participation, \\nand retention of men from low resource areas, based on observations \\nthat NDPP participation rates for men, particularly those from minority \\npopulations, are lower than rates for women. NIDDK is also supporting \\nresearch examining other ways to deliver the DPP lifestyle intervention \\nin a variety of community settings to high-risk or underserved \\npopulations through more efficient and scalable means. For example, one \\nresearch effort is testing a group-based DPP lifestyle intervention \\ndelivered by community health workers at community centers, and another \\nis examining the approach of offering a DPP-based lifestyle program to \\nat-risk retirees during the annual Medicare enrollment process. These \\nand other efforts can test novel, low-cost, and scalable ways to reach \\ngreater numbers of people who are at risk for type 2 diabetes and \\nenroll them in DPP-based lifestyle programs.\\n    Screening to identify people with prediabetes who could benefit \\nfrom the NDDP is an important component to increasing participation in \\nthe Program. The same simple blood tests identify people with \\nprediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes; in the United States, there are an \\nestimated 86 million adults with prediabetes and 8.1 million people \\nwith undiagnosed diabetes. In 2013, NIDDK scientists published a study \\nshowing that following the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force's \\n(USPSTF's) recommendations for diabetes screening--to recommend \\nscreening only for individuals with high blood pressure--missed about \\nhalf of the people with undiagnosed diabetes in the U.S. I am pleased \\nto report that the USPSTF recently updated its screening guidelines to \\nrecommend that doctors screen for diabetes and prediabetes in all of \\ntheir adult patients ages 40 to 70 who are overweight or obese. Because \\nthis is a ``B grade'' recommendation, screening for eligible \\nindividuals will be covered under the Affordable Care Act. This \\nexpanded screening could help identify more people who have prediabetes \\nand thus could benefit from enrolling in NDPP.\\n    Finally, NIDDK continues to follow the original DPP cohort in the \\nDPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) to determine long-term outcomes and \\ndurability of the DPP interventions. DPPOS has found that the lifestyle \\nintervention continues to be effective for at least 10 years, and that \\nit is especially effective in people over age 60 and is highly cost \\neffective. Additionally, the study is examining intervention effects on \\nother health-related outcomes, including co-morbid conditions such as \\ndepression.\\n    Question. How is NIDDK working with other agencies like the CDC and \\nHRSA to increase use of the program?\\n    Answer. NIDDK works closely with CDC on the jointly sponsored \\nNational Diabetes Education Program (NDEP). NDEP works with over 200 \\npublic and private partners at the Federal, State, and local levels to \\nimprove treatment and outcomes for people with diabetes, promote early \\ndiagnosis, and prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. One way \\nthat NDEP works to enhance participation in NDPP is by increasing \\nawareness about the program through its educational materials for \\npeople at risk for type 2 diabetes, their families, and their \\nhealthcare providers. For example, information about NDPP is available \\nas part of the ``Small Steps. Big Rewards'' educational campaign that, \\nbased on DPP findings, provides tools for people at risk for type 2 \\ndiabetes to take steps to reduce their risk of developing the disease. \\nFor healthcare providers, information about NDPP is provided in NDEP's \\nGuiding Principles document, which is a resource that helps guide \\nprimary care providers and healthcare teams to deliver quality care to \\nadults with or at risk for diabetes. NDPP also is included in NDEP's \\nGAMEPLAN toolkit and website for healthcare professionals. These types \\nof resources can help increase awareness of NDPP, so that people at \\nrisk know about the program and that healthcare providers could refer \\ntheir patients to it.\\n    Additionally, NIDDK collaborates with other Federal agencies, \\nincluding CDC, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the \\nIndian Health Service (IHS), the Heath Resources and Services \\nAdministration (HRSA), and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) on \\nthe statutory Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee \\n(DMICC), which NIDDK chairs. DMICC facilitates cooperation, \\ncommunication, and collaboration on diabetes among government entities. \\nNDPP was announced at the November 10, 2009 DMICC meeting, where \\ninitial results of the Y-based DPP adaptation were also presented, and \\nthe Committee expects to follow up on the NDPP in the near future. \\nDMICC meetings also serve as important venues to share information. For \\nexample, results of the DPP itself and of the research that I described \\nin response to your first question were shared at DMICC meetings, which \\ncould help inform public health and health delivery efforts by CDC, \\nCMS, IHS, HRSA, and VHA. Additionally, IHS and VHA efforts to implement \\nthe DPP lifestyle intervention for the populations they serve have been \\ndiscussed at DMICC meetings.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n             Questions Submitted to Dr. Walter J. Koroshetz\\n                Questions Submitted by Senator Roy Blunt\\n                    department of defense brain bank\\n    Question. The Department of Defense and the NIH are partnering to \\ncreate the world's first human brain tissue repository for military \\npersonnel. However, it is my understanding that NIH researchers are \\nhaving issues accessing post-mortem tissues from service members \\naffected by blast injury. Dr. Koroshetz, can you discuss the importance \\nof having access to brains that have experienced blast injuries?\\n    Answer. We do not know in what ways blasts have similar and \\ndifferent effects on the brain compared to impact injuries, or rapid \\nacceleration/deceleration injuries. The behavioral effects of blast TBI \\nmay appear similar to other TBI, but examining brain tissue is key to \\nunderstanding both whether blast injury causes distinct pathology in \\nthe brain, and how to prevent it in the future. Although Department of \\nDefense laboratories are studying the effects of blast injuries on \\nanimals, and scientists are also using computer models to try to model \\nthe physical effects on the brain, it is essential to also study human \\nbrains to understand the effects of blast injury, both in the short and \\nlong term. The human brain is unique in many ways, and the much larger \\nsize of the human brain, especially the cerebral cortex, compared to \\nanimals can substantially change the physical forces on brain tissue \\nfrom blast injury. The lack of a systematic evaluation of blast injury \\nin human brain is a major barrier to advancing research for those \\nservicemen and women who have experienced blast injury in the past or \\nmay experience it in the future.\\n    Question. What are the hurdles you are facing to gain access to \\nthese resources?\\n    Answer. An April 2015 Report to Congress entitled ``Overcoming the \\nChallenges of Obtaining Postmortem Brain Specimens from U.S. Service \\nMembers'' addresses research on brain samples and release of \\ninformation without a change of DOD policy for consent or interaction \\nwith families of deceased service members. The solutions outlined in \\nthis Report to Congress were considered the most appropriate and \\nexpedient ways to enable brain tissue donations. A neuropathology \\nlaboratory has been set up for the purpose of defining the pathology of \\nblast injury through the joint\\n    Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.''-NIH Center \\nfor Regenerative Medicine (USUHS-CNRM) and the U.S. Army Medical \\nResearch and Materiel Command. Brain tissue in the USUHS-CNRM brain \\ntissue repository can be accessed by investigators at any institution \\nthat has appropriate regulatory approval. CNRM has a USUHS \\nInstitutional Review Board-approved policy for tissue distribution and \\na steering committee that oversees the processes. NIH continues to work \\nwith DOD to improve processes for obtaining brain tissue samples for \\nresearch.\\n                  alternating hemiplegia of childhood\\n    Question. Dr. Koroshetz, Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) \\nis a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by repeated episodes of \\nweakness or paralysis that may affect one side of the body or the \\nother. It is rare, estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 1,000,000 \\nbirths. However, since cases may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, it is \\ndifficult to determine the true frequency of AHC in the general \\npopulation. What research is currently ongoing related to AHC and what \\nare future research plans likely to focus on, specifically?\\n    Answer. This August I gave the keynote address at the ``4th \\nSymposium on ATP1A3 in Disease'' in Bethesda. Alternating hemiplegia of \\nchildhood is one of several diseases caused by mutations in the gene \\nATP1A3. Others include, for example, types of dystonia-Parkinsonism and \\nepilepsy. The Bethesda meeting brought together researchers, including \\nthose supported by the NIH, and the disease advocacy community to share \\nthe latest findings, brainstorm about future directions, discuss \\ncollaborations, and highlight funding opportunities.\\n    AHC illustrates how decades of NIH investment can come to bear on a \\nparticular rare disease. ATP1A3 mutations affect the sodium-potassium \\nATPase, or ``sodium pump,'' which maintains the balance of ions that is \\ncrucial for electrical activity and other cell functions. This critical \\npump utilizes 50 percent of the brain's energy supply. Understanding \\nhow mutations disrupt function was accelerated by many years of basic \\nstudies on the sodium pump, including ongoing research by intramural \\nand extramural NINDS investigators. Researchers have also capitalized \\non new technologies, such as the recent advances in gene sequencing, to \\nhelp identify the many different mutations (more than 100), that can \\nalter the function of this ATPase.\\n    NINDS is currently funding research to understand the full range of \\ndevelopmental, motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms that \\nmutations in this gene can cause, which may allow a shared approach to \\ntherapy for the various diseases caused by mutations in this gene based \\non the underlying cause. Researchers are also applying advanced brain \\nimaging to identify the brain areas that are affected. This may enhance \\nfuture clinical trials and the ongoing care of patients by providing \\nobjective measures of progress over time, and could point the way to \\ndesign of future treatments, including deep brain stimulation. Ongoing \\nstudies of how the mutations affect cells at the molecular level of \\nanalysis will contribute to the design of rational therapies.\\n    As discussed at the symposium, NINDS provides a wide range of \\nfunding opportunities designed to support research across the full \\nspectrum from basic research of disease mechanisms, through laboratory \\ndevelopment of potential therapies, through clinical trials. One \\nspecific area of focus for future research involves the NeuroNEXT \\nclinical network, which is designed to facilitate early phase clinical \\ntrials as potential treatments emerge, especially for rare pediatric \\ndisorders. The Institute also works closely with other parts of the \\nNIH, including the Office of Rare Diseases Research to facilitate \\nresearch on diseases like AHC.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n               Questions Submitted to Dr. Nora D. Volkow\\n                Questions Submitted by Senator Roy Blunt\\n                            opioid research\\n    Question. Dr. Volkow, there has been a significant increase in \\nprescription drug abuse over the last several years. What is NIDA's \\nrole in researching new pain medications that may reduce abuse?\\n    Answer. NIDA supports several different areas of research to \\ndevelop alternative pain treatments with reduced potential for abuse. \\nPain is a symptom of many health problems and disease states, and pain \\nresearch is funded by many NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs). The NIH \\nPain Consortium was established to enhance and facilitate pain research \\nand promote collaboration among researchers addressing pain by \\ncoordinating funding opportunities across the 25 participating NIH ICs \\n(including NIDA) that support pain research.\\n    NIDA specifically supports both clinical and preclinical studies to \\ndevelop alternative pain treatments focused on the development of:\\n  --Medications that target the opioid system in new ways to reduce \\n        abuse potential. NIDA is engaging in strategic partnerships \\n        with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, private and \\n        public foundations, and small businesses to identify safer and \\n        more effective treatment options. Some examples include:\\n    --A partnership with Signature Therapeutics to develop an abuse \\n            deterrent formulation of OxyContin that uses prodrug \\n            technology--attaching an extension to the opioid molecule \\n            which renders the drug inactive unless it is taken orally.\\n    --New compounds that exhibit novel properties as a result of their \\n            combined activity at different opioid receptors (mu, delta, \\n            and kappa). Compounds with combined activity at the mu and \\n            delta receptors, or at all three receptors can induce \\n            strong analgesia without producing tolerance or dependence \\n            in animal models.\\n  --Medications that target non-opioid neurotransmitter systems, \\n        proteins, and signaling cascades including:\\n    --The cannabinoid system. Research has demonstrated the efficacy of \\n            cannabinoid compounds on central and peripheral neuropathic \\n            pain. A recently announced funding opportunity will support \\n            research to explore the therapeutic potential of the \\n            endocannabinoid system, which modulates pain through \\n            mechanisms distinct from opioids and may have a lower \\n            potential for abuse, as there are little to no mood-\\n            altering effects.\\\\13\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\13\\\\ Http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-15-188.html.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    --The transient receptor potential vannilloid (TRPV-1), which moves \\n            to the neuron's surface as nerve cells respond to pain \\n            stimuli. Blocking this TRPV-1 movement to the cell surface \\n            may be a potent means of preventing severe pathological \\n            pain conditions.\\n    --Resiniferatoxin, a novel compound that targets TRPV-1 channels. \\n            It produces robust analgesia in animal models of pain and \\n            FDA has approved its testing for terminal cancer pain (drug \\n            development was also supported by the National Institute of \\n            Dental and Craniofacial Research).\\n    --Other methods of selectively silencing pain fibers, including: 1) \\n            molecules that interrupt pain signals in pain-specific \\n            nerve cells; and 2) optical stimulation using infrared \\n            laser light to inhibit activity in pain neurons (photo-\\n            analgesia).\\n    --Fatty acid binding proteins that regulate inflammatory and pain \\n            responses.\\n    --G-protein receptor 55, which modulates inflammation and pain in \\n            animal models.\\n    --Transient receptor potential action channel A1 (TRPA1), which \\n            acts as a signal integrator for sensory nerve cells. The \\n            potential of TRPA1 antagonists as peripherally acting \\n            analgesics is being explored.\\n    --NaV1.7 sodium channels, which play a crucial role in pain \\n            signaling. Their modulation is an attractive mechanism \\n            under study to treat chronic pain.\\n  --Combinatorial approaches utilizing both opioid and non-opioid \\n        systems.\\n    --A current funding opportunity announcement ``Clinical Evaluation \\n            of Adjuncts to Opioid Therapies for the Treatment of \\n            Chronic Pain'' aims to identify novel strategies to reduce \\n            the amount of opioids administered to patients with chronic \\n            pain through combined delivery with other drugs that \\n            provide additive analgesic effects to minimize the dose of \\n            opioids needed for pain control.\\n  --Non-pharmacological strategies for the treatment of pain. Numerous \\n        non-pharmacological interventions have shown promise for the \\n        treatment of pain including:\\n    --Neural stimulation therapies--Several brain, spinal cord and \\n            nerve stimulation therapies--including transcranial \\n            magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current \\n            stimulation, electrical deep brain stimulation, and \\n            stimulation devices for peripheral nerves/tissues--have \\n            shown promise for the treatment of chronic pain.\\n    --Stem cell therapy--Researchers are exploring the effects of stem \\n            cell transplants to generate new pain signaling neurons to \\n            reduce inflammation and inhibit chronic pain.\\n    --Gene therapy and epigenetics- New technologies using innovative \\n            methods to alter gene expression are providing new targets \\n            for therapeutic development.\\n    --Complementary, integrative health approaches--Treatment \\n            approaches that consider the biopsychosocial nature of \\n            pain, include clinical studies on cognitive behavior \\n            therapy, exercise, complementary therapies, and mindfulness \\n            practices.\\n    Question. Are there factors that predispose or, conversely, protect \\nagainst opioid abuse and addiction?\\n    Answer. Although opioid medications effectively treat acute pain \\nand help relieve chronic pain for some patients, their addiction risk \\npresents a dilemma for healthcare providers who seek to relieve \\nsuffering while preventing drug abuse and addiction. Little is yet \\nknown about the risk for addiction among those being treated for \\nchronic pain or about how basic pain mechanisms interact with \\nprescription opioids to influence addiction potential. To better \\nunderstand this, NIDA launched a research initiative on ``Prescription \\nOpioid Use and Abuse in the Treatment of Pain.'' This initiative \\nencourages a multidisciplinary approach using both human and animal \\nstudies to examine factors that predispose or protect against opioid \\nabuse and addiction.\\n    Several genetic variations have been identified that interact with \\nthe way an individual processes and responds to opioid drugs. These \\ninclude variations in the m opioid receptor-1 gene (OPRM1) and the \\nenzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Other genetic factors have been \\nlinked to differences in pain perception and in response to opioid \\nanalgesics. An approach to pain treatment that seeks to integrate these \\ngenetic findings is ``pharmacokinomics,'' in which pharmacogenetic \\n(genetic differences in the response to drugs) and pharmacokinetic (how \\nthe body processes a drug) information is combined to optimize opioid \\ndosing to minimize addiction risk. These methods are still in the \\ndevelopmental phase, but offer the potential to personalize pain \\nmedicine with an eye toward addiction prevention.\\n    Question. Why are there not more medications available for \\naddiction treatment?\\n    Answer. There are currently three medications approved by the FDA \\nto treat opioid addiction and no FDA approved medications to treat \\ncocaine, methamphetamine, or cannabis use disorders. Developing new and \\nimproved treatment options for opioid use disorders remains a high \\npriority for NIDA due to the scope of the current opioid overdose \\nepidemic. Many larger pharmaceutical companies have not entered the \\naddiction market. Some of the possible reasons for this include: the \\nperception of a small market size, the difficulties in executing \\nclinical trials in patients with multiple comorbidities--many injection \\ndrug users are HIV or HCV positive and are taking multiple \\nantiretroviral drugs--and the high bar for obtaining approval for \\naddiction medications (the current FDA policy is to ask for a clinical \\ntrial endpoint of either abstinence or a pattern of reduced drug use \\ndemonstrated to be a valid surrogate for clinical benefit. However, \\nthere is not yet sufficient research demonstrating that reduced drug \\nuse is a valid surrogate to support use of this alternative end point \\nfor FDA approval. NIDA is engaging in strategic partnerships with \\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, private and public \\nfoundations, small businesses, and other Federal agencies to address \\nthese challenges. For example, NIDA, together with the FDA, academic \\nand industrial partners, are working towards establishing endpoints \\n``other than abstinence'' (OTA). One possible alternative measure is \\n``reduced drug use''; however, additional evidence that a reduction in \\ndrug use is linked to improved patient outcomes will be required by the \\nFDA to support its use. To this end, in 2013, NIDA issued an RFA \\nentitled: ``Identifying Health Outcomes Associated with changes in use \\nof Illicit Drugs'' and this year a new program announcement was \\npublished on this topic. Results so far include a recent publication \\nwhich found that reduced use of cocaine, as well as abstinence, \\ndecreased endothelial dysfunction--a marker of heart disease risk--\\ncharacteristic of chronic cocaine use.\\n    Despite these challenges, promising treatments are in development. \\nSome of the most promising findings from basic and clinical research \\naimed at developing new treatments for opioid addiction include:\\n  --Lofexidine--NIDA has awarded a series of grants to support the \\n        development of lofexidine as an adjunctive treatment for use in \\n        opioid detoxification. It is anticipated that an NDA for this \\n        drug will be filed with the FDA within the year.\\n  --Opioid vaccines--NIDA supports the development of vaccines to treat \\n        opioid addiction and prevent relapse. Multiple studies have \\n        reported encouraging preclinical results with anti-opioid \\n        vaccines. Additional development in this area is ongoing.\\n  --Buprenorphine implants--NIDA supported a Phase III clinical trial \\n        of buprenorphine implants, a novel formulation that provides \\n        stable round the clock dosing for 6 months. Based in part on \\n        this NIDA supported study, a New Drug Application (NDA) was \\n        submitted to the FDA. The sponsor (Braeburn Pharmaceuticals) \\n        recently performed additional studies requested by FDA with \\n        positive results, and a revised NDA was filed in September \\n        2015.\\n    Question. Why is it so difficult to treat?\\n    Answer. Opioid addiction is a complex brain disorder that is \\ninfluenced by many interacting factors including individual genetics, \\nas well as social, behavioral, and environmental factors. While our \\nunderstanding of the brain circuits involved in addiction is rapidly \\nincreasing, the development of medications that treat brain disorders \\nis notoriously difficult. This is because it is often difficult to get \\nenough of a medication across the blood brain barrier and into the \\nbrain without causing toxic effects in the rest of the body. As a \\nresult, many promising treatment strategies fail during human clinical \\ntrials. However, new tools are being developed to help predict which \\nmedications will fail due to human toxicity or failure to cross the \\nblood brain barrier.\\\\14,15\\\\ In addition, new technologies to more \\ndirectly modulate brain circuits--such as transcranial magnetic and \\ndeep brain stimulation hold promise for new treatment strategies.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\14\\\\ Kamimura H, Ito S.

They are safe, cost-effective, and reduce the \\nrisk of overdose as well as the risks of infectious-disease \\ntransmission and engagement in criminal activities. Nevertheless, MATs \\nhave been adopted in less than half of private-sector treatment \\nprograms, and even in programs that do offer MATs, only 34.4 percent of \\npatients receive them. Ongoing NIDA research is working to develop \\nimproved strategies for the implementation of these evidence-based \\ninterventions. This includes research to tailor treatment interventions \\nto individuals with unique needs, including those in the criminal \\njustice system or with HIV.\\n    Question. Are there barriers to research?\\n    Answer.

We are seeing a spike in overdose deaths due to \\nheroin and prescription drugs across the country. My legislation would \\nexpand access to naloxone, which reverses the effects of an overdose. \\nWhat is NIDA doing to look at ways we can better prevent overdose \\ndeaths?\\n    Answer. NIDA is an active partner in the initiative of the \\nSecretary of Health and Human Services to address the complex problems \\nof prescription opioid and heroin abuse, and the associated overdose \\nepidemic, through improving education of healthcare providers on pain \\nmanagement and proper opioid prescribing; increasing the implementation \\nof evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies; and increasing \\navailability and adoption of the effective overdose-reversal drug \\nnaloxone (see part b. below).\\n    Over-prescription of opioid medications has been a major driver of \\nthe opioid epidemic, and thus improving how physicians and other \\nhealthcare providers treat pain is a crucial part of preventing opioid \\nabuse. Unfortunately, pain management is inadequately covered in most \\nmedical, dental, and nursing schools, and for the past two decades \\nthere has been an overreliance on powerful, highly addictive opioids \\neven in chronic non-cancer pain conditions for which these drugs may \\nnot be ideal. Thus as part of the NIH Pain Consortium, NIDA supports 13 \\nCenters of Excellence in Pain Education (CoEPEs), which develop and \\ndisseminate pain curricula to improve how healthcare professionals are \\ntaught about pain and its treatment. In addition, the NIDAMED \\ninitiative develops continuing medical education (CME) courses for \\nphysicians and other healthcare providers on pain treatment as well as \\nhow to identify and address drug abuse and addiction. NIDA is also \\nactively researching alternative approaches to pain treatment, \\nincluding abuse-resistant formulations of existing opioid medications, \\nnon-opioid mechanisms for pain control (such as the endocannabinoid \\nsystem), and nonpharmacological (non-drug) approaches.\\n    Treating opioid use disorders is another crucial component of the \\nstrategy to end the opioid epidemic. Effective treatments exist for \\nthese opioid use disorders, yet they are highly underutilized across \\nthe United States. Ample research shows that, when used at sufficient \\ndose and for sufficient duration, three medications--methadone, \\nbuprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone--are highly effective at \\nreducing opioid use, keeping patients in treatment, and reducing \\ntransmission of infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C as well \\nas criminal justice involvement. Ongoing NIDA research is working to \\ndevelop improved strategies for the implementation of these evidence-\\nbased interventions.\\n    Question. Do you think expanding access to naloxone can play an \\nimportant role in reducing overdose deaths?\\n    Answer. Yes, expanding naloxone access is one of the most important \\nmeasures that can be taken to prevent death from opioid overdose. \\nExperimental pilot projects distributing naloxone to first responders, \\nopioid users, their families, and potential bystanders has shown it to \\nbe a lifesaver in communities where it has been implemented. Defying \\nthe expectations of some critics, these programs have reduced overdose \\ndeaths without causing an increase in opioid abuse in those \\ncommunities.\\n    Last year, FDA approved an auto-injector to make naloxone somewhat \\neasier to administer, however most pilot programs have continued to use \\nnaloxone syringes fitted with an atomizer to enable the drug to be \\nsprayed in the nostrils (intranasal administration), as this is less \\nexpensive and the easiest mode of administration for laypeople. \\nAdministering a drug formulated for injection intranasally is not \\nideal, however. Thus NIDA is working with FDA and drug manufacturers to \\nsupport the development and approval of an FDA-approvable formulation \\nof intranasal naloxone that would match the pharmacokinetics (i.e. how \\nmuch and how rapidly the drug gets into the body) of the injectable \\nversion. In executing this project NIDA partnered with two small \\ncompanies, AntiOP and Lightlake Therapeutics, which have each partnered \\nwith larger pharmaceutical companies, Indivior and Adapt \\nPharmaceuticals (respectively). Both Indivior and Adapt filed new drug \\napplications (NDAs) with the FDA this year.\\n\\n                         CONCLUSION OF HEARING\\n\\n    Senator Blunt.

Ileana Ros-\\nLehtinen (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.\\n    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. My opening statement, and I usually never \\nstart without Mr. Deutch being here, since he\\'s usually beating \\nme, and I\\'ll ask Mr. Issa for as long as he can to take over, \\nand then I\\'ll be back.\\n    So, after recognizing myself and Ranking Member Deutch when \\nhe comes for 5 minutes each for our opening statements, I will \\nthen recognize any other member seeking recognition for 1 \\nminute.\\n    We will then hear from our witnesses, and without objection \\nthe witnesses\\' prepared statements will be made a part of the \\nrecord. And members may have 5 days to insert statements and \\nquestions for the record subject to the length limitations in \\nthe rule.\\n    The chair now recognizes herself for 5 minutes.\\n    The Middle East and North Africa is a region rife with \\nconflict, instability, insecurity, and uncertainty as the \\nevents of the Arab Spring have shown us, but it also a region \\nwith potential. If some of those nations take the necessary \\nmeasures to step out from the uncertainty and instability, and \\ninstitute reforms and develop democratic institutions that can \\nbring them back into the global economy.\\n    My deepest apologies, Mr. Deutch.\\n    The Middle East and North Africa as a region accounts for \\nabout 5\\\\1/2\\\\ percent of the world\\'s total population, a \\npopulation that is one of the fastest growing in the world, but \\nits economic output falls short of expectations contributing \\njust over 4 percent of the world\\'s GDP.\\n    In terms of U.S. Direct Investment, the Middle East and \\nNorth Africa region as a whole accounts for just 1 percent of \\nthe nearly $5 trillion of outward U.S. foreign Direct \\nInvestment. Those numbers are incredibly lopsided, but that \\nmeans that there\\'s room to grow, and to expand. But it can only \\nbe done if many of the countries in the region implement much \\nneeded political reforms, economic reforms, rule of law \\nreforms. Local businesses and foreign businesses alike run into \\nrampant cronyism, protectionist policies, corruption, \\nregulatory burdens that stifle economic growth and take away \\nthe incentive for those seeking to do business in the region.\\n    This makes it difficult not only for the governments \\nthemselves to invest in infrastructure and integrate themselves \\ninto the global economy, but it also makes these countries \\nundesirable for foreign Direct Investment, which in turn \\nexacerbates their economic struggles and their inability to \\nreduce their already high unemployment numbers, and the cycle \\ncontinues.\\n    This is a region that continues to significantly \\nunderperform in terms of economic output relative to its total \\npopulation. That means they become overly reliant on outside \\nforeign assistance. And one of the largest providers of foreign \\nassistance is the United States, because these countries are \\nbehind in instituting democratic reform.\\n    In fact, the only democracy in the region is our close \\nfriend and major strategic partner, the Democratic Jewish State \\nof Israel. It is probably no coincidence then that Israel \\nenjoys the economic benefits that few countries in the region \\ndo, and that is why it is a great environment for American \\nbusinesses to operate and thrive in. But Israel is not the only \\ncountry in the region with whom we have strong ties. We have \\nfree trade agreements with five countries, including our \\npartners, Israel, as I mentioned, Jordan, and Morocco. But \\nthere are others which we can continue to seek ways to expand \\nour trade and investment opportunities.\\n    Is our policy too concentrated on security matters and not \\nenough on trade and investment opportunities? We need to find \\nways for American businesses to help the economies of the \\nregion grow. If we can do that, we can gain more leverage, and \\nwe can help to promote and support democratic reforms. We need \\nto work to help foster more hospitable positive environments \\nfor American and other foreign businesses because it is \\nimportant that we transition from aid to trade.\\n    Increased trade with the region will help to strengthen \\ntheir economies. The aim should not only be for American \\nbusinesses to create opportunities and more American jobs, but \\nto do the same for other countries in the region and help them \\nbecome economically sound and less dependent on our economic \\nassistance.\\n    This has been one of the missing pieces of the puzzle from \\nthe Arab Spring across the region. We need to find ways to spur \\nprivatization, investment, economic growth in these countries \\nthrough democratic reforms. If we can get those countries more \\ninvolved in the global economy, we may have a chance to see \\nmore countries like Tunisia with a path toward democracy and \\nmaybe finally see less conflict, and greater stability.\\n    So, today we\\'re here to discuss ways in which we can work \\nto reach a mutually beneficial position for U.S. businesses and \\nthe countries of the Middle East and North Africa through \\nincreased investment and trade. And with that, I will be glad \\nto yield to my ranking member, my friend, Mr. Deutch from \\nFlorida. And if I could ask Mr. Issa to take over. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Deutch. Thanks, Madam Chairman, and thanks to our \\nwitnesses for being here today.\\n    Over 4 years have past since the protests started in \\nTunisia setting off a chain reaction across the Middle East and \\nNorth Africa. With varying results, both positive and negative, \\nthe protest led to dramatic changes in the region. The Middle \\nEast and North Africa that we see today are different, in some \\nways it\\'s even indistinguishable from before January 2011.\\n    Over these years, our Government has attempted to position \\nitself and to direct our foreign aid in a way that would best \\npromote the democratic principles that we cherish here in the \\nUnited States.\\n    We often talk about the soft power that we use, commonly \\nthrough civil society groups and NGOs to promote good \\ngovernance, rule of law, equal treatment for women, and respect \\nfor religious minorities, among many other values. In this \\nhearing, I look forward to hearing our witnesses discuss the \\nrole that the U.S. Government plays in promoting a mutually \\nbeneficial economic policy with our allies in the region.\\n    An important element for any country strategy for meeting \\nthe needs of the people including here in the United States is \\neconomic growth. A country that prioritizes job creation and \\ndeveloping a robust economic infrastructure that encourages \\ninnovation, entrepreneurship, foreign investment, and expanded \\ntrade relations will find support from its population. Simply \\nput, an expanded and more widely accessible economy can \\ncontribute to a country\\'s success, and of great importance in \\nthe region especially, its stability.\\n    For these reasons, it\\'s important the U.S. Government do \\nwhat it can to help countries improve their national economies. \\nThat\\'s why our Embassies in the region are staffed with \\nliaisons working to improve bilateral commercial ties. Of \\ncourse, we wouldn\\'t act unless there was a mutual benefit, a \\nsubstantial return on our efforts.\\n    In this case, I think those benefits are clear. Each \\nAmerican private sector firm and business that benefits from \\nthis support will hopefully return the profits and jobs created \\nto meet the new demands back--to meet those new demands back to \\nthe United States. In addition, a more prosperous country that \\noffers more economic possibilities for its people will find \\ngreater stability.\\n    For a region experiencing significant population booms \\nreaching working age, enticing the youth, many of whom might \\ncome from difficult regions, enticing them with attainable \\neconomic opportunities can help rebuff lures to turn to \\nextremism and join ranks in terrorist groups like Ansar al-\\nSharia or ISIS. And for a region with such severe security \\nthreats, the United States should invest in any options \\navailable to us that can contribute to the security and the \\nstability of our allies.\\n    Understandably, destabilizing security threats and attacks \\ndiscourage trade and investments. This is reflected in our \\nfluctuating bilateral trade volume since 2010. In some cases, \\nit has rebounded well. For example, U.S. exports to Egypt \\nslipped in the years when the country was dealing with \\npolitical uncertainties. In 2014 it returned to pre-2012 \\nlevels. Today our exports to Tunisia have risen significantly. \\nSince the revolution, obviously, we pay close attention to the \\nresults of the recent attacks. But it\\'s important to remember \\nthat growing ones economy isn\\'t simply increasing trade or \\nforeign investment. We should not forget that many of the \\nrevolutions in the region were encouraged by large populations \\nwho did not feel the ripple effect of foreign commerce in their \\nlives. That\\'s why public trust in the government is also \\nessential.\\n    If the people of a country don\\'t see the benefits of \\nexpanded and more international commerce in their country; for \\nexample, if the profits and jobs remain solely among a small \\nelite class, then the same grievances that we heard so loudly 4 \\nyears ago will remain unabated.\\n    A country without the institutional framework for handling \\nexpansion into new sectors or increased demand volume for \\nexports and imports will not run efficiently, and won\\'t \\nmaximize the positive financial impact on the country.\\n    The government also needs to insure that they are fostering \\nfuture generations of educated citizens able to continue the \\nspecialized work of modernizing an economy. Without proper \\nworker protections and equal access for women, a modern economy \\ncannot approach full efficiency and maximization of resources.\\n    These are important considerations for countries amid their \\npolitical transitions, but we should also be cognizant of best \\npractices so that we can be prepared to take on the rebuilding \\nand the changes that will come in Syria, in Libya, and in \\nYemen.\\n    I look forward to the witnesses\\' testimony which I hope to \\nhear what steps are being taken to support U.S. commerce in the \\nregion, while at the same time considering the other factors in \\nplay to insure that the expanded commercial ties benefit the \\nentire country in all regions from the bottom to the top.\\n    I thank the chairman, and I yield back.\\n    Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. And, briefly, the 1 minute \\nI would be given by the chair were she still here. t his is an \\nimportant hearing and it will in many ways go unnoticed.\\n    Every day ISIS is in the front lines of discussion while, \\nin fact, the areas that have fomented so much of this \\nopportunity for extremism sometimes doesn\\'t get looked at \\nproperly.\\n    Today, our witnesses are, in fact, two individuals who are \\nat the front line of dealing with the pre-event portion of it, \\nthe diplomatic portion. Over the years, whether it was \\nAmbassador Welsh, Ambassador Satterfield, or William Burns, all \\nof Ambassador Burns, all of them have had similar jobs, or in \\nsome cases the identical job you have. Each of them has been a \\nmentor to me, and acutely understood what it will take in order \\nto fix the problem. So, as I listen to your statements and \\nfollow-up with questions, I will be asking, and I will be \\ninterested to know now that, as Mr. Deutch mentioned, now that \\nthe Arab Spring has proven that eliminating a dictator and \\nreplacing them with democracy is not the answer. It may, in \\nfact, be an important step in some cases, but the institution \\nof real rule of law, civil rights, and the opportunity in an \\nentrepreneurial, economic way to go from a lack of prosperity \\nto prosperity; in other words, the have nots having the \\nopportunity to eventually be the haves, and not to the \\nexclusion of others, the rising tide that in America raises so \\nmany out of poverty, or out of middle class, or out of the \\nupper middle class and does not exist in Africa or most \\nportions of the Middle East, in fact, will be a critical part \\nof what I\\'ll ask for today.\\n    And with that, it\\'s my pleasure to introduce our panel of \\nwitnesses. First, I\\'m pleased to introduce Ms. Elizabeth \\nRichard, who serves as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State \\nfor the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. Previously, she served \\nas the DCM or Deputy Chief of Mission in Sana\\'a. Boy, that was \\nan esoteric place to be that you can tell us more about, and \\nthe border coordination in Islamabad. She also was the Deputy \\nto the Special Ambassador for War Crimes and Special Assistant \\nUndersecretary for Political Affairs. Welcome.\\n    Second, we welcome Mr. Scott Nathan, who is the Special \\nRepresentative for Commercial and Business Affairs for the \\nBureau of Economic and Business Affairs. In the past, he has \\nworked as the Chief Risk Officer in the private sector at the \\nBob Post Group in Boston, and served as the economic advisor to \\nthe Governor of Massachusetts, who will remain nameless, but a \\ngovernor.\\n    And with that, Ms. Richard, you\\'re recognized for more or \\nless 5 minutes.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF MS. ELIZABETH RICHARD, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, \\n    BUREAU OF NEAR EASTERN AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE\\n\\n    Ms. Richard. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you, thank \\nyou, Mr. Ranking Member and members of the subcommittee who may \\njoin us later. Thanks very much for the opportunity to testify \\nhere today.\\n    Those of us who work on the Middle East and North Africa \\nare all too familiar with the distressing news that routinely \\ncomes out of the region. But as this subcommittee knows all too \\nwell, the region faces deep structural challenges that feed the \\nhistoric instability that we\\'re seeing today.\\n    However, what\\'s too often overlooked and what seldom gets \\nenough publicity is the good news story of the growing economic \\nopportunities for American business in the region.\\n    Over the past 4 years alone, U.S. trade with the Middle \\nEast and North Africa has grown on an average by $1 billion a \\nyear, and it\\'s reached $197 billion just last year. And U.S. \\nexports to the region are at an all time high, and our trade \\ndeficit with the region is rapidly shrinking.\\n    American businesses can and do make an immediate and \\nlasting impact on the region. Simply by investing and creating \\njobs in the Middle East and North Africa, American businesses \\ncan help make the region stronger, and that ultimately \\nstrengthens the American economy, as well.\\n    Let me be clear that jobs alone will not solve the problem \\nof violent extremism, but they can provide opportunity and \\npurpose for a very large population of at-risk people, \\nincluding youth.\\n    Moreover, facilitating U.S. businesses access to markets \\naround the region is a crucial part of Secretary Kerry\\'s \\neconomic diplomacy. A central mission of all our Embassies is \\nto fiercely advocate on behalf of American enterprises. \\nAmbassadors and our Embassy staff frequently sit down with \\nAmerican businesses to advise, strategize, and work with them \\non local business opportunities. They\\'ll meet personally with \\neconomic ministers if there\\'s a public solicitation that U.S. \\nbusiness can bid on.\\n    For example, in April, Ambassador Joan Polaschik after \\nnumerous talks with Algeria\\'s Minister of Transportation helped \\nGE finalize a $20-million deal with the state-owned railroad \\ncompany. In Iraq, Ambassador Stuart Jones and the U.S. Embassy \\nteam relentlessly advocated with high-ranking officials there, \\nand 2 weeks ago finally the grain board of Iraq announced that \\nit would spend $37 million to buy 63,000 metric tons of rice \\ngrown here in the United States is Louisiana, Missouri, \\nArkansas, and Texas. In Egypt, our Embassy in Cairo \\nsuccessfully advocated on behalf of the Great Lakes Dredge and \\nDock Company which has won a $135-million contract for work in \\nthe Suez Canal. And countries in the Middle East and North \\nAfrica have become some of Boeing\\'s largest markets. Over the \\npast few years, customers there have purchased or placed orders \\nwith Boeing worth more than $130 billion; 200 777 Aircraft \\nwhich include 300 American-made GE engines were ordered just \\nlast year alone.\\n    Ranking Member Deutch, Mr. Congressman, 41 American \\ncompanies with ties to Florida have foreign subsidiaries in the \\nregion, and companies from every part of our country do \\nbusiness there.\\n    Interestingly, and I think this is important, many of them \\nare immediately recognizable to people in the region as \\nAmerican. For example, Arby\\'s has opened a franchise in Iraq, \\nand Nestle Tollhouse is poised to begin business there soon. \\nJohnny Rockets, ReMax, Pizza Hut and 26 other franchises will \\nopen for business in Tunisia thanks in large part to the work \\nthat the U.S. Embassy has done with the Tunisian Government and \\nother stakeholders to liberalize franchising laws.\\n    Obviously, these successes alone will not solve the serious \\nchallenges this region faces, but we need to make headway, and \\nwe need our business community to play a leading role in \\naddressing the deep economic problem this region faces.\\n    So, I thank you very much for the opportunity to testify \\ntoday, and I look forward to your questions.\\n    [The prepared statement of Ms. Richard follows:]\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n        \\n    \\n                              ----------                              \\n\\n    Mr. Issa. Mr. Nathan.\\n\\n   STATEMENT OF MR. SCOTT NATHAN, SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR \\n    COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS, BUREAU OF ECONOMIC AND \\n           BUSINESS AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE\\n\\n    Mr. Nathan. Thank you, Mr. Issa, Mr. Deutch, and other \\nmembers of the committee. I appreciate the opportunity to \\ntestify today.\\n    Despite the challenges facing this region, there are still \\nmany opportunities for business, and my testimony will focus on \\nwhat the State Department is doing to help U.S. firms seize \\nthese opportunities.\\n    The business and investment climate in these countries can \\nbe difficult, but we are working with the private sector and \\nour partners to try to reverse this trend, create more jobs, \\nand spur inclusive growth. By investing and employing more \\npeople, U.S. firms play an important role in helping transform \\nthe economic landscape of the Middle East and North Africa. \\nBecause of their high standards and business practices, U.S. \\nfirms often set an example that helps catalyze broader change. \\nThey participate in local American Chambers of Commerce and \\nother business councils helping to give important private \\nsector voice to the reform agenda.\\n    My chief responsibility as the Department\\'s Special \\nRepresentative for Commercial and Business Affairs is to help \\nlevel the playing field for our companies to win more contracts \\nand enter new markets. In my 16 months as Special \\nRepresentative, I visited the Middle East and North Africa \\nthree times, and I will return to continue our efforts to \\nstrengthen commercial linkages next week.\\n    To assist the economic transitions in the region, we\\'re \\ntaking a three-pronged approach that presses for policy reform, \\nsupport our companies in pursuing commercial opportunities, and \\nhelps the development of local entrepreneurs and SMEs.\\n    First, we\\'re engaging with our Government partners through \\ntrade agreements and economic policy dialogues to support their \\nmarket-oriented reform agendas, and to facilitate greater \\nbusiness ties with the United States. Creating jobs and \\nopportunity through private sector-led expansion is critical to \\nthe future success of the region.\\n    We push for open trade and investment policies that will \\npromote sustainable growth and enable American businesses to \\nhave fair access to these growing markets. Our two-way trade in \\nthe region more than doubled over the last 5 years, and around \\na quarter of our exports to the region were sent to our five \\nfree trade agreement partners; Israel, Morocco, Oman, Bahrain, \\nand Jordan.\\n    Under the FTA with Israel, for example, bilateral trade \\nreached approximately $38 billion in 2014, up from $2.6 billion \\nwhen the agreement began 30 years earlier. In Jordan, our FTA \\nenabled a local company, PETRA Engineering, to purchase over \\n$15 million worth of equipment from U.S. SMEs just this year \\nalone, and every air conditioning unit they produce and export \\naround the globe uses components made in the United States.\\n    Second, we\\'re hoping to connect our private sector with \\npromising opportunities and we\\'re doing what we can to position \\nour companies to succeed. A high priority for Ambassadors and \\nEmbassy teams in the MENA region and around the world is to \\nadvocate for U.S. companies bidding on foreign government \\nprocurements.\\n    Last year our advocacy efforts contributed to over $45 \\nbillion worth of sales in the region supporting thousands of \\njobs in a dozen states. For example, Bechtel won a $3.1 billion \\ncontract in Saudi Arabia last year to design and construct new \\nmetro lines in Riyadh assisted by advocacy from then Ambassador \\nJames Smith and Secretary Kerry. Divida Health Care Partners \\nwon a $1.3-billion contract to provide dialysis services after \\nstrong mission Saudi Arabia support. In 2014, State Department \\nadvocacy helped secure Florida-based Blumberg Grain, a contract \\nto provide 93 storage and processing sites across Egypt. At the \\nrecent Egypt economic development conference, General Electric \\nannounced a $1.6-billion deal to provide more than 2 gigawatts \\nof power generation equipment, most of which is now operating \\nand helping Egyptians meet their peak summer demand.\\n    Third, we\\'re helping to support local private sector \\ndevelopment from the ground up through programs that bolster \\nSMEs and entrepreneurs. Just one example, for the last few \\nyears, Coca-Cola has partnered with the State Department and \\nthe Kelly School of Business to host a summer entrepreneurship \\nprogram for 100 college students from across the MENA region. \\nThese future business and civic society leaders returned to \\ntheir countries with new skills and contacts better enabling \\nthem to start businesses and create jobs. On a much larger \\nscale, President Obama\\'s Global Entrepreneurship Summit helps \\ndeepen ties between business leaders, NGOs, academics, and \\naspiring entrepreneurs. And GES has been twice held in the \\nregion. Last year in Morocco, we instituted a day devoted to \\nhelping youth and women entrepreneurs.\\n    To conclude, I\\'ve discussed only a small sample of our \\neconomic engagement with the Middle East and North Africa. \\nSustainable economic development in this region is integral to \\ndefending our nation\\'s interests and insuring the security of \\nall Americans. Our private sector plays a key role in this, and \\nwe\\'re there to support them.\\n    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Nathan follows:]\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n            \\n                              ----------                              \\n\\n    Mr. Chabot. Thank you very much. We appreciate your \\ntestimony here this morning, and we\\'ll now recognize members \\nfor 5 minutes, and I\\'ll begin with myself.\\n    The--in May 2011, the President announced the launch of the \\nMiddle East and North Africa Trade and Investment Partnership \\nInitiative with the proposed goals of facilitating regional \\ntrade, promoting integration with U.S. and European markets, \\nand helping to construct a regional trade agreement. He stated, \\n``This strategic objective was to create an economic force for \\nreform and to assist with democratic transitions in the Middle \\nEast,\\'\\' yet, very little has been said about the partnership \\nsince its launch, and there\\'s no mention of it at all in the \\nPresident\\'s latest trade policy agenda, or either of your \\ntestimonies. What is the status of the partnership, and why was \\nit not included in the President\\'s trade policy agenda? And \\nI\\'ll open it either one of you. Mr. Nathan.\\n    Mr. Nathan. Sure. Thank you very much, Mr. Chabot.\\n    In terms of our work with our partners in the region on \\ntrade, we have numerous bilateral dialogues in which the \\npossibility of economic reform to lay the groundwork for a \\ntrade agreement is underway. Just this year we had economic and \\nstrategic dialogues with Morocco. We\\'re doing so with Israel \\nand the UAE, but in order to move forward with trade agreements \\neither on a bilateral or a multilateral basis, we need to see \\nprogress on the reform agenda broadly.\\n    Mr. Chabot. Thank you. Let me move to another question \\nhere.\\n    Where are we in meeting in the partnership strategic \\nobjective, and if it\\'s not yet been that, does the President \\nplan on extending the partnership\\'s mandate?\\n    Mr. Nathan. I can\\'t give you a status report on where we \\nare on the objectives. What I would recommend is that we have \\nour experts from our trade area come up and brief you on that, \\nspecifically.\\n    Mr. Chabot. All right. Well, we would appreciate the \\nadministration get back to the committee with answers to that.\\n    Mr. Nathan. Absolutely.\\n    Mr. Chabot. Many countries in the region are working hard \\nto diversify their economies. Which countries have been more \\nsuccessful at this diversification, which need to do more, and \\nhow is the United States helping in their efforts? Ms. Richard?\\n    Ms. Richard. Sir, I think Israel is a terrific example of a \\ncountry that\\'s done exactly that. Over the past 30 years, the \\ndiversification, the investment in the private sector, the \\ninvestment in technology has allowed Israel to play on par with \\nthe developed world and with the West. There are a couple of \\nothers that are starting to make progress. I think Tunisia is \\nworking very hard in this direction, and we have quite a bit of \\nengagement with the Tunisian Government on exactly this point, \\nthe need to diversify their economy beyond some of the \\ntraditional agricultural products, and some progress has been \\nmade there.\\n    Mr. Chabot. Do you think that the recent terrorist attack \\nin Tunisia will have any impact on their progress in that area?\\n    Ms. Richard. I don\\'t think it will have any impact on the \\ngovernment\\'s commitment to diversify, but I think the fact that \\nthe tourism industry took such an immediate and significant \\nhit, has only highlighted the need to further diversify that \\neconomy. I think that they are completely devoted to continuing \\nto work on that.\\n    Mr. Chabot. Thank you.\\n    The United States has a number of trade investment \\nframework agreements with countries in the region. How many of \\nthose are likely to develop into something more, and are there \\nany countries that we consider concluding a free trade \\nagreement with that we don\\'t currently have?\\n    Mr. Nathan. So, in terms of countries that we might enter \\ninto free trade agreements, I can\\'t specifically comment on \\nwhat the prospects are with an individual country, but what I \\ncan say is that in all of our dialogue, either formal or \\ninformal, with countries in the region we\\'re pressing forward \\nwith the reform agenda, providing technical assistance on the \\nchange in laws to move toward more market-oriented regulations, \\ncutting through bureaucracy, protection of intellectual \\nproperty rights, all the things that lay the basis for then \\ntaking the next step toward a free trade agreement.\\n    Mr. Chabot. Okay, thank you. I think I\\'ve got time to get \\none more question in here before my time expires.\\n    While Saudi Arabia is our largest trading partner in the \\nMiddle East by overall volume, it\\'s mainly due to U.S. oil \\nimports, of course. What\\'s preventing additional U.S. exports \\nand investment in other economic sectors, and what is State \\ndoing to encourage additional opportunities for U.S. commerce?\\n    Mr. Nathan. So, as I mentioned in my testimony, we\\'ve been \\nadvocating hard. Our Ambassadors and posts on the grounds, as \\nwell as Washington-based principals to win contracts for \\nAmerican countries in Saudi Arabia. I cited a few examples.\\n    There\\'s always progress that could be made on transparency \\nand openness of procurement processes, and opening up of the \\nbusiness and investment climate. But, for example, Saudi Arabia \\nalready is the third largest importer of automobiles from the \\nUnited States, so it\\'s a high indication of opportunities to \\ndiversify our trade with Saudi Arabia.\\n    Mr. Chabot. Thank you very much. My time has expired. The \\nranking member, Mr. Deutch, is recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Deutch. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Ms. Richard, you spoke about the--you gave us some big \\npicture data points on the growth of our economic \\nrelationships. And, Mr. Nathan, you spoke about individual--you \\ngave some examples of individual companies who have benefitted, \\nbut if you could--I would love to hear you tell us what you\\'re \\nmost excited about. I mean, this is what you do every day. What \\nare you most excited about in the region and opportunities for \\nAmerican business?\\n    Ms. Richard. Maybe I can start with that, sir. And thank \\nyou for the question, because there\\'s a lot to be excited \\nabout. And I think that\\'s--we\\'re very thrilled to be there--to \\nbe here today for exactly this reason. There is so much bad \\nnews coming out in the press that you can\\'t believe anything \\ngood is happening, but there is a lot. And I think one of the \\nthings, we always talk about the youth demographics here as a \\nproblem, and an obstacle, and a danger, and something that can \\nbe exploited by terrorists, and that\\'s all true. But it\\'s also \\nan incredible opportunity, and I think if you look at some of \\nwhat\\'s being done on the small and medium enterprise scale, \\nparticularly as regards technology, there is a lot that\\'s \\nhappening, and it\\'s very exciting.\\n    It is moving around a little bit some of the moribund \\neconomies, some of the things that keep these economies from \\ndeveloping like lack of transparency, poor regulatory \\nenvironment and the like. And it\\'s also really opened up an \\navenue for women to join the workforce. Women in the workforce \\nin the Middle East is the lowest level in the world. In Africa, \\nfor example, about 63 percent of the labor force is women; in \\nthe Middle East it\\'s 21 percent. But technology has given an \\nopportunity for women, and especially young people to work \\nbeyond those obstacles. So, for example, we can have women \\nrunning a business from their home. They can employ other women \\nwho are also working from their home. And we have some really \\ninteresting programs to help with this, Tech Women, Tech Girls. \\nWe bring female entrepreneurs to the United States to sit with \\ntheir counterparts here and learn how to do this. So, I think \\nthe opportunity side of what\\'s going on with this huge youth \\npopulation and the opportunity for U.S. business to take \\nadvantage of that is huge.\\n    Mr. Deutch. Great, thanks. Mr. Nathan.\\n    Mr. Nathan. So, I echo my colleague\\'s comments about the \\nopportunities in entrepreneurship. There\\'s just fantastic \\nopportunities there for us to make progress, and empowering \\nyouth, women, disadvantaged communities by giving them the \\ntools, the ability to reach their human potential through \\nstarting a business, and helping them navigate through what is \\noften a very challenging environment of bureaucracy.\\n    But I want to return to what we do on commercial advocacy. \\nIt\\'s really in many ways the bread and butter of what my office \\nfocuses on. There are many parts of the U.S. Government which \\nhelp support this, the Department of Commerce and elsewhere \\naround the interagency, but I\\'m a competitive guy. I\\'m a deal \\nguy. I like to win, and the idea of helping U.S. companies \\ncompete on a level playing field and win contracts that not \\nonly help on the ground in the region bring examples of good \\nbusiness practice, but also strengthen our own economy at home \\nand create jobs. That\\'s a win-win. I know how much our \\nAmbassadors on the ground are committed to this idea. They like \\nto win, and they\\'re competitive, as well.\\n    Mr. Deutch. All right, thanks.\\n    Can we just get back to something you both just mentioned, \\nwhich was some of the positive aspects on the ground in \\nsociety. Is it too soon for us--well, can you identify positive \\nsocial trends? Is it too soon to describe trends we\\'ve seen \\nwith respect to advancement for women, or more opportunities \\nfor young people in countries where we\\'ve seen increased \\neconomic ties with the United States?\\n    Mr. Nathan. So, I\\'d say that I think from a statistical \\npoint of view it\\'s probably too soon to prove that out. There \\nare plenty of anecdotes, however. I mean, one that I\\'ll just \\nhighlight, under the Global Entrepreneurship Program that we \\ncoordinate out of the Office of Commercial and Business \\nAffairs, we\\'ve recently signed up an entrepreneur in residence, \\nthe first regional entrepreneur for the Gulf Region. She\\'s a \\nwoman, a star on reality TV in Kuwait, has a huge social media \\nfollowing, and really serves as in a large-scale way a mentor \\nto women throughout the region about the possibility of \\nempowering themselves through business. It\\'s anecdotes like \\nthat that I think give me hope for the future.\\n    Mr. Deutch. Ms. Richard.\\n    Ms. Richard. Yes, I would second that. And if I might from \\nmy own experience in Yemen for the 3 years from the start of \\nthe Arab Spring and 3 years on, one of the things I saw among \\nthe younger people is a willingness, and ability, and comfort \\nlevel to sit with each other, to collaborate with each other \\namong the youth, and among men and women, which is very, very \\ndifferent. And in quite a very conservative country as Yemen \\nis, it was very interesting to see this through the Arab Spring \\nprotests and through the national dialogue process, which ended \\nup with young men and young women sitting together to try and \\ncreate a new constitution for the country.\\n    Mr. Deutch. Thanks. And to the extent--this is very helpful \\nto the extent that there are American businesses who hearing \\nall of the wonderful opportunities you discussed would like to \\nlearn more. I mean, what\\'s the best place? Where should members \\ndirect them to go for the best and central location for this \\ninformation?\\n    Mr. Nathan. Well, there\\'s a--I mean, the best source of \\ninformation about opportunities on the ground are our posts, \\nour missions, our Embassies, the Ambassadors and their teams. \\nBut whether it\\'s the State Department, the Commerce Department, \\nor other parts of the Government here in Washington, we have \\nmany programs through our Web sites that provide that sort of \\ninformation.\\n    Mr. Deutch. Any in particular, Ms. Richard? Thanks.\\n    Ms. Richard. No, I would agree with that. This is an \\nabsolute priority for Secretary Kerry. Economic diplomacy is \\nforeign policy, and so the State Department is a great place to \\nstart. Our colleagues at the Department of Commerce also spend \\nan awful lot of their time and energy doing this, and as Mr. \\nNathan said, our Ambassadors live and breathe to do exactly \\nthis.\\n    Mr. Deutch. Let me try it a different way.\\n    Mr. Nathan. I can mention one specifically.\\n    Mr. Deutch. Please, yes.\\n    Mr. Nathan. So, we have a program called the Direct Line \\nfor Business. It\\'s instituted in 2012. It allows SMEs and other \\nbusinesses here to connect with our posts on the ground to \\nconsider particular opportunities. The Ambassadors and their \\nteams through webinars or conference calls can relate business \\nopportunities. We\\'ve had 30 of these webinars just in the MENA \\nregion alone. They\\'re focused on opportunities like the health \\ncare sector in Oman, or the security sector in Libya.\\n    Mr. Deutch. Finally, Ms. Richard, that\\'s helpful if the \\nbusiness is not quite at that point, they just want to learn \\nmore and they went to State.gov, what should they look for? I\\'m \\njust trying to really----\\n    Mr. Nathan. So, at State.gov, there\\'s the Commercial and \\nBusiness Affairs tab, and Business USA.\\n    Mr. Deutch. That\\'s what I want.\\n    Mr. Nathan. Thanks.\\n    Mr. Deutch. Okay, thanks very much. I yield back.\\n    Mr. Trott. I want to thank the ranking member for holding \\nthis hearing, and also thank the witnesses for testifying. And \\nI now recognize myself for 5 minutes.\\n    Either witness, the United States\\' decreased reliance on \\nMiddle Eastern crude oil has caused the price of oil to fall \\nbelow $50 a barrel. Is that negatively impacting our \\nrelationship with countries in the region, either witness would \\nbe great?\\n    Ms. Richard. Let me start and simply say no, it has not \\nreally affected our relationships. Our relationships across the \\nregion are based very, very much more than simply on oil, and I \\nthink you see that today. What I would say that is the change \\nin the price has changed the dynamics in the region a little \\nbit, depending on whether you\\'re a net producer or a net \\nimporter. But, fundamentally, we have such a broad range of \\ninterests in that region that this is only one aspect of it.\\n    Mr. Nathan. I would say, I mean, it probably goes without \\nsaying, but the effect of lower oil prices on the budgets and \\neconomies of some of the countries in the region has been \\ndetrimental.\\n    Mr. Trott. With respect to Egypt, the efforts to privatize \\nstate-owned industries has slowed in recent years due to legal \\nchallenges. What\\'s the--how has that impacted U.S. commerce, \\nand what are we doing to try and move the privatization process \\nalong in Egypt?\\n    Ms. Richard. That\\'s an absolutely excellent question, \\nbecause that is a fundamental problem for that economy. Egypt \\nis a country with a moribund economy, with a very small, as in \\nscale private sector. The private sector is actually quite \\nclosed, and there are many, many significant problems. If you \\nlook at a recent World Bank study, for example, on the \\nconstraints to growth, they are macroeconomic instability, \\nregulatory instability, political instability, and corruption. \\nAnd these four elements are present in Egypt in a significant \\nway, so we are working very hard with the Egyptian Government \\nto help them recognize these key areas that need to be worked \\non, to open up the economy not just for U.S. business, but for \\ntheir own companies to grow.\\n    Mr. Nathan. Can I just briefly add to that?\\n    Mr. Trott. Please.\\n    Mr. Nathan. I had the opportunity to travel with Secretary \\nKerry to Egypt in March for the Egypt Economic Development \\nConference. It was really an event that highlighted that \\naspiration to move forward with the reform agenda, and to \\ncreate more opportunities for business. There were many, many \\nAmerican companies there. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce hosted a \\nhuge event, and many deals, whether Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, GE were \\nall announced at this event. So, there still are great \\nopportunities in Egypt, and we\\'re working hard at multiple \\nlevels to help them with the reform agenda to make sure that \\nnot only is their economy strengthened, but U.S. companies have \\na chance to compete.\\n    Mr. Trott. And how would you assess President Sisi\\'s \\nefforts to deal with the economic problems and attract foreign \\ninvestment in Egypt?\\n    Mr. Nathan. So, as I just mentioned, the conference that \\nhappened in March was an event that I think was very personally \\nimportant to President Sisi. Many leaders from around the \\nregion, many businesses from around the globe attended it. He \\nwas front and center the whole time, and I think really drove \\nthe agenda. There\\'s a lot of challenge, as my colleague \\nmentioned, in Egypt, but I think there\\'s no shortage of energy \\ndevoted to pushing forward with the reform agenda and the \\neconomy.\\n    Mr. Trott. Okay. In Lebanon, they\\'re working hard to combat \\ncorruption and the anti-bribery network, and is it--are they \\nmaking progress? Is it lending itself to a more commercially \\nreasonable environment for folks to do business in Lebanon?\\n    Ms. Richard. They are making some progress. It\\'s slow, and \\nthe fact that there hasn\\'t been a President for a long time, \\nand the government is a little bit stuck is definitely a \\nproblem. The other thing I\\'d say is a problem, and the Lebanese \\neconomy is incredibly resilient, somehow has posted a very \\nmodest gain this year, I think about 2 percent, which is really \\nsaying something in the environment that exists there now.\\n    The instability in the region and the overflow from Syria, \\nthough, is creating serious problems for them, and they affect \\ntourism, the tourism sector, they affect investment and the \\nwillingness of investors to go into the country. So, these are \\ntwo areas that are extremely vulnerable right now, and I think \\nthat we need to keep working on the macroeconomic part of this, \\nthe laws, et cetera. But the stability issue is also very much \\nan element here.\\n    Mr. Trott. With respect to Morocco, I think I have time for \\none more question. It\\'s the gateway for growing economies in \\nthe African Continent, except unemployment is staggeringly \\nhigh. Is there a reason for this disconnect? And, again, are \\nthey making progress in trying to bring the unemployment down \\nin Morocco?\\n    Mr. Nathan. So, I know that they\\'re very focused on the \\nquestion. I was there last November. They hosted President \\nObama\\'s fifth Global Entrepreneurship Summit, and two elements \\nof what you mentioned in your question were highlighted by the \\nGovernment of Morocco through this event. One is their place is \\na gateway to Africa, and I should mention they\\'re the only \\ncountry on the Continent of Africa with whom we have a free \\ntrade agreement. And the second point was doing what\\'s \\nnecessary to spark entrepreneurship. In a clear way the \\nbureaucracy changed the attitude in the region toward taking a \\nrisk and provide the support and mentorship necessary to make \\nthat possible. It\\'s through small enterprises, through \\nentrepreneurs that they\\'ll be able to create the jobs to absorb \\nthe unemployment problem that you\\'re talking about. And it was \\nclear, 6,000 people attended this event in Marrakesh. It was \\nclear that they had put a lot of effort into that, and were \\nputting force behind it.\\n    Mr. Trott. All right. Well, my time is expired. I\\'m not \\nsure if there are any other members of the committee that have \\nquestions. Ranking Member Deutch, please.\\n    Mr. Deutch. Thanks, I appreciate it. Thanks to both of you \\nfor coming. It\\'s a very positive story that you\\'re telling that \\nwe don\\'t often get a lot of positive news in this committee, so \\nI appreciate that.\\n    I just wanted to circle back, Mr. Nathan, to the--you both \\nmentioned the Florida companies that are impacted by all this, \\nbut there\\'s one in South Florida, in particular, Blumberg \\nGrain. The suppliers for that project are U.S.-based. They are, \\nas I understand it, mostly small and medium-sized businesses. \\nHow--on a project like that where there are some 93 storage \\nsites I think you said, how do you--what role can you play to \\ninsure that a company like that, when deals like that come \\nalong, how do we insure that it can be built upon when there \\nare successes that wind up having the benefits back home for \\nthe suppliers to those companies?\\n    Mr. Nathan. So, thanks for the question, because Blumberg \\nGrain really is a success story. They attended the conference \\nin March that I mentioned, the Egypt Economic Development \\nConference, and they\\'ve had good news since the advocacy that I \\nmentioned that got them the first contract for the 93 storage \\nfacilities. President Sisi has recently announced a tripling of \\nthe program with this company. It\\'s not only an example of an \\ninnovative solution with U.S. content that is a successful \\nexport, it\\'s also solving a problem for Egyptian society and \\nthe Government of Egypt, which is food security, how to have \\nbetter storage and processing at a cheaper price in a more \\nefficient way throughout Egypt. I mean, it\\'s been a millennial \\nproblem in the region, and Blumberg Grain is bringing a \\nsolution to that. They work closely with our post on the \\nground. They work closely with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and \\nthe local U.S.-Egypt, and Egypt-U.S. Business Councils. They \\ntake full advantage of the opportunities to get in front of the \\nEgyptian Government, and push forward the advantage of their \\nproduct, and we\\'re there to support them.\\n    Mr. Deutch. That\\'s great. I appreciate that. Thanks very \\nmuch, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\n    Mr. Trott. Well, I don\\'t believe any other committee \\nmembers--recognize the gentleman from Virginia for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Connolly. Forgive me, Mr. Chairman, I had a markup the \\nOversight and Government Reform Committee, and had a bill to be \\nmarked up. And welcome to our panel.\\n    If I could ask maybe some broader geopolitical questions \\nabout commerce in this region, has commerce effectively stopped \\nin large chunks of the region given insurgencies, and \\ninstability, and violence? I mean, how has it affected our \\ncommerce with Lebanon? Either one.\\n    Ms. Richard. Well, maybe I can start. Absolutely, the \\ninstability in the region has affected commerce, but it \\ncertainly has not stopped commerce. And I think the two of us \\ntoday have mentioned, and also in our written testimony, really \\na staggering number of success stories that we don\\'t hear about \\nevery day in the press. And I know our Ambassador in Egypt, \\nAmbassador Beecroft, is currently working on advocacy for I \\nthink about $19 billion worth of deals right now.\\n    Mr. Connolly. Of?\\n    Ms. Richard. About $19 billion worth of deals. The Embassy \\nin Egypt is advocating right now. Now, that\\'s a very good \\nnews--that\\'s very much a good news story, and there\\'s a lot \\nhappening.\\n    In Lebanon, in particular, I mentioned a moment ago, \\nLebanese companies somehow, and the Lebanese economy is somehow \\nmanaging to be very resilient in the face of quite a bit of \\ninstability on its borders, and recently posted about a 2-\\npercent growth. That\\'s modest growth, but that\\'s growth in a \\nregion that\\'s quite challenged right now. But there\\'s no doubt \\nthat this situation is affecting, as I mentioned, investment, \\nforeign Direct Investment in Lebanon. And it\\'s affecting the \\ntourism sector, and it\\'s also affecting those sectors that \\ndepend on transportation because so many of the transport \\nnetworks throughout the region, intra regional trade depend on \\ngoing through Syria.\\n    Mr. Connolly. Sure. I would also--to what extent is \\npersonal security a barrier, as well? I mean, businessmen and \\nbusinesswomen, and investors are willing to take risks up to a \\npoint, but if my own personal security is always at risk where \\nI stay, where I eat, when I travel, who I meet with, there are \\nplenty of places to invest and do business with that don\\'t put \\nme in that kind of risk. And have my family back home really \\nworried sick about my personal security. To what extent is that \\na serious barrier in encouraging U.S. deals, trade, investment?\\n    Ms. Richard. Let me just have one personal story here. I \\ncan tell you from having served, a career foreign service \\nofficer and my last three postings have been Sana\\'a, Yemen, \\nIslamabad, Pakistan, and Kabul, Afghanistan. So, I can tell \\nyou----\\n    Mr. Connolly. Somebody loves you at the State Department, \\nobviously, Ms. Richard.\\n    Ms. Richard. I did something right or wrong.\\n    Mr. Connolly. Yes, you did something----\\n    Ms. Richard. But I can tell you, yes, risk is absolutely an \\nissue, but one can work in these areas. And I think American \\ncompanies are looking at these markets. Look at Egypt, 90 \\nmillion people, that is a vast market for consumer goods and \\nfor all kinds of commerce. So, they\\'re looking at those, \\nthey\\'re assessing their security, of course, and we work very \\nclosely through our OSEC councils to collaborate with U.S. \\ncompanies. Our Ambassadors meet with them regularly to talk \\nabout risk, but there\\'s a lot of opportunity here. And \\ncompanies, I think, are making smart decisions.\\n    Mr. Connolly. Mr. Nathan?\\n    Ms. Richard. Mr. Nathan.\\n    Mr. Nathan. I really don\\'t have anything to add to that. I \\nwas going to mention the role that our posts on the ground \\nthrough the OSECs play in helping businesses.\\n    I guess what I would say is that we meet with businesses \\nall the time that are looking for assistance in pursuing \\nopportunities through the region, and the question you raised \\ndoes not come up. I think in------\\n    Mr. Connolly. Does not?\\n    Mr. Nathan. Does not come up, and I think the reason is \\nthat many of these companies have operated in this region and \\nelsewhere around the world for years where there are security \\nchallenges. And that doesn\\'t make it easy, but it means that \\nthey\\'ve become to some extent accustomed with how to deal with \\nit. It does act as a tax on doing business. This is true in any \\nregion where there\\'s instability. But, nonetheless, the \\nopportunities are such that they continue to pursue them.\\n    Mr. Connolly. Well, I\\'m somewhat--I mean, I worked in the \\nprivate sector for 20 years until I came up here, and I can \\ntell you, the two companies I worked for were both \\ninternational, and we did our own assessment of risk. Now, \\nmaybe that\\'s what happens, we decide we\\'re not going to play in \\ncertain venues and you don\\'t ever meet with us. And, as I said, \\nI mean, I understand that especially in more dicey parts of the \\nworld the risk factor is higher, of course. But I guess I\\'m \\nasking to what extent does it become a real high barrier for a \\nU.S. presence? I was with some folks who have been multiple \\ntimes, many multiple times to Afghanistan and, candidly, the \\nsecurity situation has just plummeted in the last few years, \\nand you can\\'t do business. I mean, it\\'s very--I mean, maybe you \\nneed to stay in the compound. If you stay there, you have to \\nhire armed guards. If you\\'re outside the green zone you\\'re at \\nrisk, you could be targeted. You\\'re very aware of it, and \\nthey\\'re having trouble recruiting anybody who wants to frankly \\nwork in that kind of environment.\\n    Mr. Nathan. Yes.\\n    Mr. Connolly. At any rate, I just--I think it\\'s good to \\nhear that we\\'re still doing business in the region, and there \\nare deals to be had and we haven\\'t abandoned. But I\\'d love to \\nget more of a sense of--but with rising instability in certain \\nparts of the region, the rise of ISIS and, you know, outright \\nwarfare, and what\\'s going on in Syria, and dislocations, and \\nrefugee populations swelling, and so forth, has that \\nappreciably shown itself in data in terms of U.S. economic \\npresence to a trade investment and the like? And I\\'d be very \\ninterested in following that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Trott. The gentlewoman from New York is recognized for \\n5 minutes.\\n    Ms. Meng. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and \\nto our witnesses for being here today.\\n    I have a question about in general localities in states \\nsuch as California has had water shortage and drought issues. I \\nknow that in the region, Middle East in general, but \\nparticularly Israel has had a lot of success in groundbreaking \\ntechnology and usage of techniques in water shortage situations \\nof their own. So, I know that there\\'s been some conversation \\nand some action, but I was wondering your thoughts on \\npotentially more areas of collaboration between Israel and \\nlocalities or states, such as California, and what more could \\nbe done on a Federal level, how we can be more helpful?\\n    Mr. Nathan. So, I would just mention that our collaboration \\nmostly at a private sector to private sector level with Israel \\ncould not be stronger. If you look at collaboration in research \\nand development and innovation, the relationship between the \\nhigh-tech community in the United States, much of which is in \\nCalifornia, but spread throughout the country and the high-tech \\nsector in Israel is incredibly strong. U.S. firms locate \\nresearch and development centers in Israel because of the high \\nlevel of talent.\\n    After China, there\\'s no country that has more NASDAQ listed \\ncompanies than Israel, a reflection of the innovation and \\ndynamism of their private sector in the high-tech area. So, I \\nthink there\\'s some that we can do to provide the backdrop and \\nframework for that. We\\'ve had our very first free trade \\nagreement with any country was with Israel. It\\'s celebrating \\nits 30th anniversary. There\\'s exchange from a scientific and \\nacademic point of view. We have policy dialogues, economic \\npolicy dialogue with Israel in a very robust way. But I think \\nreally, ultimately, it\\'s the private sector collaboration and \\ndeep linkage between the two countries that\\'s going to produce \\nthe type of results you asked about.\\n    Mr. Trott. Thank you. Well, I don\\'t believe there are any \\nother members of the committee that are here with questions. So \\nunless the ranking member has any other questions, or gentleman \\nfrom Virginia, we thank you for your insight and your testimony \\nthis morning, and the committee stands adjourned.\\n    Mr. Nathan. Thank you very much.\\n    [Whereupon, at 10:56 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]\\n                                     \\n\\n                                     \\n\\n                            A P P E N D I X\\n\\n                              ----------                              \\n\\n                                 [all]\\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body></html>\\n'}, 'CHRG-114shrg94463': {'raw_text': '<html>\\n<title> - GAO\\'S HIGH-RISK LIST AND THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION</title>\\n<body><pre>[Senate Hearing 114-299]\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\n\\n\\n                                                        S.

JOHNNY ISAKSON, CHAIRMAN, \\n                   U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA\\n\\n    Chairman Isakson. I call this hearing of the Senate \\nVeterans\\' Affairs Committee to order.\\n    We appreciate our witnesses being here today. We are here \\nto talk about the GAO\\'s High-Risk List, something the VA enjoys \\na prestigious place on in many areas. I appreciate the \\ntestimony we are about to hear. I read a lot of the testimony \\nlast night before the hearing today and I think this will be a \\nmeaningful and important hearing.\\n    As of April 1, 2015, more than 100, approximately 68 \\npercent, of GAO\\'s recommendations are still open, and 40 \\npercent of the recommendations are more than 3 years old. These \\nare VA recommendations. GAO meets regularly with the VA to \\ndiscuss what is needed to get off of the list. It should not \\ntake a public scolding like a hearing of this type for the VA \\nto implement both GAO and IG recommendations.\\n    It is unclear from VA\\'s testimony if they even understand \\nthe importance of being on the list or off the list, for that \\nmatter. Nowhere in VA\\'s testimony do they address the specific \\nconcerns raised over the years by GAO or the IG. The testimony \\nonly outlines the programs VA has said it put in place for a \\nlong time. If those programs had worked, VHA would not have \\nbeen placed on the list to begin with. VA should not simply \\nfocus on the number of recommendations they can close. They \\nshould focus on all the recommendations. Much like the scandal \\nthat erupted in Phoenix this time of year, the problem was not \\nisolated to Phoenix but it was systemic in nature.\\n    Historically, the government as a whole performs very \\npoorly in the area of information technology and VA is no \\nexception. Federal IT has been the area of concern for GAO. \\nProtecting our veterans\\' personal health care information is a \\nfundamental trust of the VA, yet it continues to be a security \\nissue, most recently highlighted by the IG, whose report and \\ntestimony today, I might add, is outstanding. Allowing \\ncontractors to access VA\\'s network from foreign countries, \\nparticularly China, raises enormous red flags. The IG\\'s \\ntestimony outlines the fact that the VA has over six thousand--\\nsix thousand--outstanding systems security risks that have not \\nbeen remediated.\\n    It is time we raised the visibility of this problem to a \\npublic hearing, and I am delighted to turn it over to Ranking \\nMember Richard Blumenthal.\\n\\n OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, RANKING MEMBER, \\n                 U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT\\n\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chairman, and thank you \\nonce again for your leadership on these issues we have found in \\nthe VA.\\n    This week, I received an update from the GAO on the VA\\'s \\nprogress in addressing some of the recommendations since the \\nannouncement of VHA\\'s inclusion on the High-Risk List. I also \\nunderstand that the VA and GAO are meeting periodically in an \\neffort to address some of the outstanding recommendations. \\nThese recommendations deal with deep seated, systematic \\nproblems in Veterans Health Administration, including \\ninadequate oversight and accountability, ambiguous policies and \\ninconsistent processes, information technology challenges, \\ninadequate training for VA staff, and unclear resource needs \\nand allocation priorities.\\n    The services that you provide are to people who are \\naccustomed to a chain of command and to people being held \\naccountable in that chain of command. When someone fails to do \\nhis or her job, they are fired. I would like to see the same \\naccountability in the VA and in the Federal Government that we \\nsee in the United States military most of the time--not all of \\nthe time, but at least where men\\'s and women\\'s lives are at \\nstake. They are in our health care system every bit as they are \\nin combat. I would like to see the same expectation of \\naccountability, and I hope that the GAO\\'s report and its list \\nwill indicate that the time for accountability is now.\\n    I share the Chairman\\'s concerns and I expect a very \\nproductive and informative hearing today. Thank you.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal.\\n    We will go directly to our testimony. I welcome Senator \\nBrown to our hearing today. Thank you for being here.\\n    We have three witnesses to testify, Debra Draper, Ph.D., \\nDoctor, Director of Health Care Team, the Government \\nAccountability Office; John Daigh, Doctor, Assistant Inspector \\nGeneral for Healthcare Inspections, Office of the Inspector \\nGeneral, and Mr. Gary Abe, Deputy Assistant Inspector General \\nfor Audits and Evaluations, Office of Inspector General; and we \\nall know Carolyn Clancy, Dr. Carolyn Clancy, Interim Under \\nSecretary for Health, Department of Veterans Affairs, \\naccompanied by Stephen Warren, the Executive in Charge for the \\nOffice of Information Technology and the Chief Information \\nOfficer.\\n    We will begin with Dr. Draper.\\n\\n  STATEMENT OF DEBRA A. DRAPER, Ph.D., DIRECTOR, HEALTH CARE, \\n             U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE\\n\\n    Ms. Draper. Chairman Isakson, Ranking Member Blumenthal, \\nand Members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to \\nbe here today to discuss the addition of veterans\\' health care \\nto GAO\\'s High-Risk List for the first time in 2015.\\n    Since 1990, GAO has regularly reported on government \\noperations that we have identified as high risk due to their \\nvulnerability to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or the \\nneed for transformation to address economic, efficiency, or \\neffectiveness challenges. In my testimony today, I will address \\nthe specific areas of concern that led to VA health care being \\nadded to GAO\\'s High-Risk List and actions needed for its \\nremoval.\\n    In designating VA health care as high risk, we categorize \\nour specific concerns into five broad areas. The first area of \\nconcern is VA\\'s ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes. \\nThis has led to inconsistencies in how facilities interpret \\npolicies and carry out processes at the local level. In 2012, \\nfor example, we reported that unclear policies led staff at VA \\nfacilities to inaccurately record the required days for \\noutpatient medical appointments and to inconsistently track new \\npatients waiting for medical care.\\n    The second area of concerns is inadequate oversight and \\naccountability. Specifically, we found that certain aspects of \\nfacilities implementation of VA policies are not routinely \\nassessed, oversight activities are often impeded by VA\\'s \\nreliance on facilities\\' self-reported data, and oversight \\nactivities are not always sufficiently focused on compliance \\nwith requirements. The facilities\\' self-reported data lack \\nindependent validation and often are inaccurate or incomplete.\\n    The third area of concern is VA\\'s information technology \\nchallenges. In various reports, we identified extensive \\nlimitations in the capacity of existing technology systems, \\ninformation technology systems, including systems that are \\noutdated and inefficient. For example, we have reported on VA\\'s \\nfailed attempts to modernize its appointment scheduling system, \\nwhich is prone to user error and manipulation.\\n    The fourth area of concern is inadequate staff training. In \\na number of reports, we identified gaps in VA training that \\nplaces the quality and safety of veterans\\' health at risk. For \\nexample, in our October 2014 report on VA\\'s implementation of \\nits new nurse staffing methodology, staff reported that the \\ntraining was time consuming to complete and difficult to \\nunderstand. They also said it was difficult finding the time to \\ncomplete the training while also carrying out their patient \\ncare responsibilities.\\n    The fifth area of concern is unclear resource needs and \\nallocation priorities. In various reports, we discussed gaps in \\nthe data VA needs to efficiently identify resource needs and \\nensure that resources are effectively allocated across its \\nhealth care system. In May 2013, for example, we reported that \\nVA lacked critical data needed to efficiently assess whether \\nthe use of non-VA providers was more cost effective than \\naugmenting its own capacity to deliver some services.\\n    VA has taken actions to address some of our recommendations \\nrelated to its health care system, including those related to \\nthe five broad areas of concern just discussed. However, there \\nare more than 100 recommendations that have yet to be fully \\nresolved.\\n    It is critical that VA leaders act on the findings of its \\nOffice of the Inspector General, GAO, and others to develop and \\nimplement solutions that mitigate risk for the timeliness, cost \\neffectiveness, quality, and safety of veterans\\' health care. \\nThe Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act included a \\nnumber of provisions intended to help VA address systemic \\nweaknesses. Effective implementation, coupled with sustained \\nCongressional intention, will help ensure that VA continues to \\nmake progress in improving veterans\\' health care.\\n    We plan to continue monitoring VA\\'s efforts to improve its \\nhealth care system. We currently have work underway focusing on \\nareas such as veterans\\' access to primary care and mental \\nhealth care services, primary care productivity, non-VA care, \\nand mechanisms VA uses to monitor quality of care.\\n    An assessment of the status of VA health care\\'s high-risk \\ndesignation will be done during our next update in 2017 using \\nthe five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List. These \\ninclude leadership commitment, capacity, development of an \\naction plan, monitoring, and demonstrated progress.\\n    Mr. Chairman, this concludes my opening remarks. I am happy \\nto answer any questions.\\n    [The prepared statement of Ms. Draper follows:]\\n Prepared Statement of Debra A.

DAIGH, JR., M.D., C.P.A., ASSISTANT \\nINSPECTOR GENERAL, OFFICE OF HEALTHCARE INSPECTIONS, OFFICE OF \\n    INSPECTOR GENERAL, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS; \\nACCOMPANIED BY GARY ABE, DEPUTY ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR \\n      AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS, OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL\\n\\n    Dr. Daigh. Chairman Isakson, Ranking Member Blumenthal, \\nMembers of the Committee, I am honored to attend this hearing. \\nThe Office of the Inspector General\\'s work through its Office \\nof Healthcare Inspections, Office of Audit and Evaluations, and \\nOffice of Investigations supports the decision of GAO to place \\nVeterans Health Administration on its High-Risk List.\\n    There have been a number of recent hearings which have \\nidentified many of the issues that VA must address, from \\nbusiness processes, IT capabilities, organizational structure, \\nto personnel practices. VA leadership has committed to make \\nthese changes.\\n    The Choice Act recognizes that VA cannot provide all the \\nmedical care that veterans require. The decisions to make or \\nbuy health care must be done carefully and with broad community \\ninput. I hope that stakeholders will test the decisions VA \\nmakes over the coming months primarily by assessing the impact \\nthat decisions have upon the quality of health care provided.\\n    With that, Mr. Abe from the OIG Office of Audits and \\nEvaluations and I will be pleased to answer your questions.\\n    [The prepared statement of Dr. Daigh follows:]\\n    Prepared Statement of John D. Daigh, Jr., M.D., CPA, Assistant \\n    Inspector General, Office of Healthcare Inspections, Office of \\n         Inspector General, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\\n    Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, Thank you for the \\nopportunity to discuss the Office of Inspector General\\'s (OIG) health \\ncare reviews and audits of programs and performance of the Veterans\\' \\nHealth Administration (VHA). I am accompanied by Gary Abe, Deputy \\nAssistant Inspector General for Audits and Evaluations, Office of \\nInspector General.\\n    VHA is at risk of not performing its mission as the result of \\nseveral intersecting factors. VHA has several missions, and too often \\nmanagement decisions compromise the most important mission of providing \\nveterans with quality health care. Leadership has too often compromised \\nnational VHA standards to meet short term goals. The Veterans \\nIntegrated Service Networks (VISN) do not consistently support local VA \\nmedical centers (VAMC) to encourage success and proactively address \\nareas of risk. Resource management data gaps make the cost-effective \\ndelivery of a national benefit challenging. VHA\\'s internal processes \\nare inefficient and make the conduct of routine business unnecessarily \\nburdensome.\\n                 primary mission is quality health care\\n    VHA has many missions, the first of which should be the delivery of \\nhigh quality health care. The first test of a management decision \\nshould be an assessment of its impact upon the delivery of quality \\nhealth care. For example, veterans who receive their medical care \\nthrough the VA need timely access to emergency care. The management of \\na possible myocardial infarction, stroke, or appendicitis requires not \\nonly a sophisticated emergency room and readily available imaging, but \\nhospital specialty treatment rooms and dedicated teams to provide \\ntimely critical care. Many smaller hospitals cannot provide timely \\nexpert care for patients with these conditions. VHA\\'s decision to \\noperate an emergency room or urgent care center should have the quality \\ndelivery of this care as its most important standard. Arguments that \\nveterans prefer to receive their care at VA or that this care creates \\ncontracting difficulties are secondary to the imperative that high \\nquality care be provided. All medical care provided at each facility \\nshould be considered against this test.\\n      vha leaders must set high standards and support subordinates\\n    The many OIG reports on the Phoenix VA Health Care System and \\nproblems with the VA appointment system highlight the challenges \\nleaders must overcome if quality health care is to be provided.\\n    Since May 28, 2014, we have issued four reports on the Phoenix VA \\nHealth Care System (PVAHCS).\\\\1\\\\ The initial two reports (May 2014 and \\nAugust 2014) were the result of work by a multidisciplinary staff from \\nthe OIG\\'s Office of Audits and Evaluations and Office of Healthcare \\nInspections. The OIG found patients at the PVAHCS experienced access \\nbarriers that adversely affected the quality of primary and specialty \\ncare provided for them. Patients frequently encountered obstacles when \\nthey or their providers attempted to establish care, when they needed \\noutpatient appointments after hospitalizations or emergency department \\nvisits, and when seeking care while traveling or temporarily living in \\nPhoenix. The problems in Phoenix were due to a failure by management to \\nrecognize the increased demands on the facility and to request and \\napply the resources to address those demands either through increased \\nstaffing or increased use of non-VA fee care.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Healthcare Inspection--Radiology Scheduling and Other \\nAdministrative Issues, Phoenix VA Health Care System, Phoenix, Arizona, \\nFebruary 26, 2015; Interim Report--Review of Phoenix VA Health Care \\nSystem\\'s Urology Department, Phoenix, Arizona, January 28, 2015; Review \\nof Alleged Patient Deaths, Patient Wait Times, and Scheduling Practices \\nat the Phoenix VA Health Care System, August 26, 2014; Interim Report: \\nReview of VHA\\'s Patient Wait Times, Scheduling Practices, and Alleged \\nPatient Deaths at the Phoenix Health Care System, May 28, 2014.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Also, senior headquarters and facility leadership were not held \\naccountable for implementing action plans that addressed compliance \\nwith scheduling procedures. The use of inappropriate scheduling \\npractices caused reported wait times to be unreliable. The \\nunderreporting of wait times resulted from many causes, to include the \\nlack of available staff and appointments, increased patient demand for \\nservices, and an antiquated scheduling system. The ethical lapses \\nwithin VHA and PVAHCS\\'s senior leadership ranks and mid-level managers \\nalso contributed to the unreliability of reported access and wait time \\nissues, which went unaddressed by those responsible.\\n    In our first two reports, we made 24 recommendations to VA to \\nimplement immediate and substantive changes to their policies and \\nprocedures. The VA Secretary concurred with all 24 recommendations and \\nsubmitted acceptable corrective action plans. As of March 3, 2015, 18 \\nrecommendations from these reports remain open. In response to our \\nwork, VA reported it took immediate action to ensure that 3,400 \\nveterans who we identified needed health care services received medical \\nappointments. Our review identified that use of unofficial wait lists \\nand manipulation of wait time data were pervasive practices in VA. As a \\nresult, VA reported it took immediate actions to reach out to over \\n266,000 veterans to get them off wait lists and into clinics, made \\nnearly 912,000 referrals to private health care providers for needed \\ncare, and scheduled approximately 200,000 new VA appointments \\nnationwide for veterans. These reports brought much needed \\naccountability over serious access issues, led to changes in the \\nhighest level of VA leadership, and enactment of the Veterans Access, \\nChoice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (also known as The Choice Act), \\nwhich expanded veterans\\' access to care outside the VA system and \\nincluded a $16 billion increase in VA\\'s funding.\\n    The most recent reports issued by the OIG\\'s Office of Healthcare \\nInspections were the results of information received during the work \\nconducted at the PVAHCS during the spring and summer of 2014. Our \\nJanuary 28, 2015, interim report on PVAHCS\\'s Urology Services requires \\nVA\\'s immediate attention. It is also indicative of the challenges that \\nVA faces in staffing and coordinating non-VA care. After experiencing a \\nstaffing shortage within the PVAHCS Urology Department, some patients \\nwere referred to non-VA urologists via voucher or fee basis \\nauthorization. In 23 percent of cases reviewed, we found approved \\nauthorizations for care, notations that authorizations were sent to \\ncontracted providers, and scheduled dates and times of appointment with \\nnon-VA urologists but no scanned documents verifying that patients were \\nseen for evaluations and, if seen, what the evaluations might have \\nrevealed. This finding suggests that PVAHCS has no accurate data on the \\nclinical status of the patients who were referred for urologic care \\noutside of the facility.\\n           vha organizational entities must be more effective\\n    The current VISN structure has not worked effectively to support \\nand solve problems facing hospitals. A VISN contains medical facilities \\nof varying size and capability. For example, one requirement for all \\nmedical facilities is that their providers be properly credentialed and \\nprivileged. One aspect of privileging providers is the presentation of \\nphysician performance data to the hospital privileging committee. In a \\nforthcoming report on solo physicians\\' professional practice \\nevaluations, we found that in hospitals where there are specialty units \\nwith small numbers of providers, it is difficult to obtain unbiased \\npeer reviews of clinical cases and appropriate assessments of clinical \\nperformance by peers. The VISN structure has been inconsistently \\neffective in addressing this issue.\\n    Each VISN has a different internal organization and each medical \\nfacility has a different internal structure. This lack of \\nstandardization makes the dissemination of information and policy to \\nfacilities challenging and the acquisition of critical data from \\nfacilities more difficult. When we tested facility compliance with \\ndirectives regarding the proper treatment of reusable medical \\nequipment, we found significant non-compliance with initial policy \\nstatements.\\\\2\\\\ When we looked at VA data on compliance with \\ninstructions to address shortcomings in the consult management process, \\nthere was wide variance across the VISNs in compliance with \\ninstructions.\\\\3\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\2\\\\ Use and Reprocessing of Flexible Fiberoptic Endoscopes at VA \\nMedical Facilities, June 16, 2009; Follow-Up Colonoscope Reprocessing \\nat VA Medical Facilities, September 17, 2009.\\n    \\\\3\\\\ Healthcare Inspection--Evaluation of the Veterans Health \\nAdministration\\'s National Consult Delay Review and Associated Fact \\nSheet, December 15, 2014.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                          resource management\\n    VHA\\'s budget and execution data across the system does not permit \\nready analysis at the Department or clinic level across VHA. The cost \\nof providers and support staff is often a relevant cost in health care \\nfinancial analysis. VHA does not have an adequate system to build the \\nhuman requirements to provide health care appropriate for financial \\nanalysis. In recognition of this issue, Congress passed The Choice Act \\nwhich requires the OIG for the next 5 years to report on the staffing \\nneeds of VHA and to audit the accuracy and timeliness of payments made \\nunder this law within 30 days after VHA has spent 75 percent of the \\n$9.7 billion in funding authorized for patient care. Our first report \\nwas issued on January 30, 2015, in which we noted that the five \\noccupations with the largest staffing shortages were Medical Officer, \\nNurse, Physician Assistant, Physical Therapist, and Psychologist.\\\\4\\\\ \\nThe data presented is VHA\\'s ``wish\\'\\' list for talent, not a requirement \\ndriven list. The requirement for VHA to develop a staffing methodology \\nis not new. OIG assessed whether VHA has an effective methodology for \\ndetermining physician staffing levels for 33 of VHA\\'s specialty care \\nservices.\\\\5\\\\ Audits and inspections continue to identify the need for \\nVHA to improve its staffing methodology by implementing productivity \\nstandards. Public law mandates VA establish a nationwide policy to \\nensure medical facilities have adequate staff to provide appropriate, \\nhigh-quality care and services. We found VHA did not have an effective \\nstaffing methodology to ensure appropriate staffing levels for \\nspecialty care services. Specifically, VHA did not establish \\nproductivity standards for all specialties and VA medical facility \\nmanagement did not develop staffing plans. This occurred because there \\nis a lack of agreement within VHA on how to develop a methodology to \\nmeasure productivity, and current VHA policy does not provide \\nsufficient guidance on developing medical facility staffing plans. \\nOther essential personnel in a hospital, to include pharmacists, \\ndieticians, physical therapists, also do not have staffing standards.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\4\\\\ OIG Determination of Veterans Health Administration\\'s \\nOccupational Staffing Shortages, January 30, 2015.\\n    \\\\5\\\\ Audit of Physician Staffing Levels for Specialty Care Services, \\nDecember 27, 2012.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Each VISN and hospital has its own unique organizational chart. The \\ncombination of a lack of a robust capability to determine requirements \\nand a lack of organizational standardization impedes the ability of \\nmanagers to make effective financial decisions.\\n                  operational efficiency must improve\\n    A number of VHA\\'s internal operations and systems, which should be \\nseamless to providers, do not function well. The appointment system \\ninefficiencies have contributed to wait time problems. Medical \\nconsultation software was permitted to devolve such that information \\nwithin the system was not standard and in many cases not reliable. This \\nhas resulted in patients who were lost to appropriate colon cancer \\nscreening. The process of hiring a new employee is extremely cumbersome \\nand is but one element of the human resources management program that \\nmust improve. The work-arounds and lost productivity attributed to \\nthese ``systems\\'\\' makes the delivery of quality care much more \\ndifficult.\\n      the veterans access, choice, and accountability act of 2014\\n    Implementation of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability \\nAct of 2014 is a considerable challenge for VA. In addition to \\ncoordinating care for patients outside the VA system, VA also has to \\nensure that payments are made timely and accurately and that results of \\nmedical appointments are shared between VA and non-VA providers. These \\nissues have been problematic in the past for VA. The OIG has provided \\nsignificant oversight of billing issues in the non-VA Fee Care program \\nover the last several years.\\\\6\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\6\\\\ Audit of Veterans Health Administration\\'s Non-VA Outpatient Fee \\nCare Program, August 3, 2009; Veterans Health Administration--Review of \\nOutpatient Fee Payments at the VA Pacific Islands Health Care System, \\nMarch 17, 2010; Review of Veterans Health Administration\\'s Fraud \\nManagement for the Non-VA Fee Care Program, June 8, 2010; Audit of Non-\\nVA Inpatient Fee Care Program, August 18, 2010; Review of Alleged \\nMismanagement of Non-VA Fee Care Funds at the Phoenix VA Health Care \\nSystem, November 8, 2011; Administrative Investigation, Improper \\nContracts, Conflict of Interest, Failure to Follow Policy, and Lack of \\nCandor, Health Administration Center, Denver, Colorado, April 12, 2012; \\nReview of Enterprise Technology Solutions, LLC, Compliance with \\nService-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Program Subcontracting \\nLimitations, August 20, 2012; Veterans Health Administration--Review of \\nSouth Texas Veterans Health Care System\\'s Management of Fee Care Funds, \\nJanuary 10, 2013.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                              non-va care\\n    Non-VA medical care is care provided to eligible veterans outside \\nof VA when VA facilities are not feasibly available. It consists of two \\nmajor programs, Non-VA Care Inpatient and Outpatient programs and \\nPatient-Centered Community Care (PC3).\\n    The OIG has continued to report that VHA faces significant \\nchallenges to address serious nationwide weaknesses in its Non-VA Care \\nInpatient and Outpatient programs. Total annual Non-VA Care Program \\ndisbursements have grown from about $4.4 billion in fiscal year (FY) \\n2009 to about $5.6 billion in FY 2014.\\n    As early as 2009, we reported that VHA improperly paid 37 percent \\nof outpatient fee claims resulting in $225 million in overpayments and \\n$52 million in underpayments. We estimated $1.1 billion in overpayments \\nand $260 million in underpayments over the next 5-year period if VHA \\ndid not strengthen its processes for authorizing fee care services. In \\nFY 2010, we reported that VHA improperly paid 28 percent of inpatient \\nfee claims resulting in net overpayments of $120 million and estimated \\n$600 million in improper payments could be processed over the next 5-\\nyear period.\\n    In response to our August 2010 audit of Non-VA Inpatient Fee Care \\nProgram, VHA agreed there will be general cost savings and efficiencies \\nrealized with consolidating the fee program\\'s claims processing system \\nto achieve better economies of scale. Although specific cost savings \\ndepend on the actual consolidated strategy VA selects and on how well \\nVA implements the chosen strategy, we conservatively estimated that \\ncurrent program inefficiencies cost VHA about $26.8 million in FY 2009, \\nand could cost about $134 million through FY 2015. Today, we do not see \\nVHA moving forward with an actual consolidation strategy for payment \\nprocessing in the fee care program.\\n    In September 2013, VA awarded Health Net Federal Services, LLC, and \\nTriWest Healthcare Alliance Corporation PC3 contracts totaling $5 \\nbillion and $4.4 billion, respectively. The expected life of the \\ncontracts is a base year plus 4 option years. VHA established the PC3 \\ncontracts to provide veterans timely access to high-quality care from a \\ncomprehensive network of non-VA community providers.\\n    This week we plan to publish the first of five projects that are \\nreviewing various aspects of VA\\'s PC3 contract and the effectiveness of \\nits implementation. All five focus on the operational risk areas that \\ndirectly affect veterans\\' waiting times, access to services, and \\ncontinuity of care. The remaining four projects are reviewing whether \\nPC3 contracted care issues are causing delays in patient care; whether \\nPC3 networks are providing adequate veteran access to care; whether PC3 \\ncontractors are providing VHA with timely medical documentation; and \\nthe effectiveness of PC3 contract pricing. We plan to issue the \\nremaining four reports in FY 2015.\\n    The report published this week was requested by the House \\nAppropriations Committee to review VA\\'s FY 2014 PC3 costs and VA\\'s FY \\n2014 budget submission that stated PC3 contracts would save $13 million \\nin FY 2014. Our analysis of available PC3 data determined that \\ninadequate price analysis, high up-front contract implementation fees, \\nand low PC3 utilization rates impeded VA from achieving its $13 million \\nPC3 cost saving estimate in FY 2014. VA paid the PC3 contractors \\napproximately $18.9 million in FY 2014:\\n\\n    <bullet> $15.1 million (80 percent) for implementation and \\nadministrative fees\\n    <bullet> $3.8 million (20 percent) for health care services\\n\\nThese same health care services would have cost about $4.0 million if \\nthey had been purchased under the non-VA care program. Thus, PC3 cost \\nabout $14.9 million more than if VA had used the non-VA care program to \\npurchase the same health care services. This occurred because VA did \\nnot conduct adequate price analyses to support its cost-savings \\nestimate. Further, VA lacked an implementation plan to ensure the \\nutilization of PC3. Thus, VA could not ensure it achieved the estimated \\ncost savings and recouped the fees paid to the PC3 contractors. VA \\nsimply assumed that the PC3 contractors would develop adequate provider \\nnetworks; VA medical facilities would achieve the desired 25 to 50 \\npercent contract utilization rates; and the accrued PC3 cost savings \\nfor health care services would more than offset the contractors\\' fees. \\nThese flawed assumptions contributed to significant PC3 contract \\nperformance problems and a 9 percent utilization rate in FY 2014.\\n                   opioid management at va facilities\\n    Of increasing concern in VA and in the Nation is the use of opioids \\nto treat chronic pain and other conditions. In May 2014, we issued a \\nnational review, Healthcare Inspections--VA Patterns of Dispensing \\nTake-Home Opioids and Monitoring Patients on Opioid Therapy, that \\ndescribed some of the issues facing patients on high dosages of \\nopioids. In addition to this national review, we have issued nine \\nreports detailing opioid prescription issues within VA since 2011.\\\\7\\\\ \\nPatients prescribed opioids frequently have complex co-morbid \\nconditions, making them more likely to be given multiple medications \\nthat can interact dangerously with opioid medications even leading to \\ndeath. These patients remain a high risk population.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\7\\\\ Healthcare Inspections--Alleged Inappropriate Opioid \\nPrescribing Practices Chillicothe VA Medical Center, Chillicothe, Ohio, \\nDecember 9, 2014; Healthcare Inspections--Quality of Care and Staff \\nSafety Concerns at the Huntsville Community Based Outpatient Clinic, \\nHuntsville, Alabama, July 17, 2014; Healthcare Inspection--Medication \\nManagement Issues in a High Risk Patient Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center, \\nTuscaloosa, Alabama, June 25, 2014; Healthcare Inspection--Quality of \\nCare Concerns Hospice/Palliative Care Program Western New York \\nHealthcare System, Buffalo, New York, June 9, 2014; Healthcare \\nInspections--Alleged Improper Opioid Prescription Renewal Practices San \\nFrancisco VA Medical Center, San Francisco, California, November 7, \\n2013; Healthcare Inspection--Management of Chronic Opioid Therapy at a \\nVA Maine Healthcare System Community Based Outpatient Clinic, \\nAugust 21, 2012; Healthcare Inspection--Alleged Improper Care and \\nPrescribing Practices for a Veteran Tyler VA Primary Care Clinic, \\nTyler, Texas, August 19, 2011; Healthcare Inspection--Patient\\'s \\nMedication Management Lincoln Community Based Outpatient Clinic, \\nLincoln, Nebraska, August 10, 2012; Healthcare Inspection--Prescribing \\nPractices in the Pain Management Clinic at John D.

We assessed the effectiveness of \\nVHA\\'s National Call Center for homeless veterans in helping veterans \\nobtain needed homeless services.\\\\8\\\\ The call center is VA\\'s primary \\nvehicle for communicating the availability of VA homeless programs and \\nservices to veterans and community providers. Our oversight identified \\nserious problems in the Call Center\\'s intake and referral processes \\nthat were seriously hampering the Call Center\\'s effectiveness and \\nservices to homeless veterans. Of the approximately 51,500 referrals \\nmade in FY 2013, the Call Center provided no feedback or improvements \\nto VAMCs to ensure the quality of the homeless services and closed 47 \\npercent of referrals even though the VA medical facilities had not \\nprovided the homeless veterans any support services.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\8\\\\ Veterans Health Administration--Audit of the National Call \\nCenter for Homeless Veterans, December 3, 2014.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                        va procurement practices\\n    We have continually reported in VA\\'s Performance and Accountability \\nReport the challenges VA faces in the area of procurement, to include \\nplanning, solicitation, negotiation, award, and administration. Many of \\nour reports have identified weaknesses in procurement actions that did \\nnot provide assurance that VHA obtained fair and reasonable prices or \\nthat competition requirements were met.\\\\9\\\\ Today VHA still needs a \\nmodern inventory system. In FY 2012, we reported VHA needs to \\nstrengthen VAMC management of prosthetic supply inventories to avoid \\nspending funds on excess supplies and to minimize risks related to \\nsupply shortages. VAMCs spent about $35.5 million to buy prosthetic \\nsupplies in excess of current needs. Also, VAMCs increased the risks of \\nsupply expiration and disruptions to patient care due to supply \\nshortages.\\\\10\\\\ We recommended VHA implement a modern inventory system \\nand strengthen management of prosthetic supply inventories. As an \\ninterim measure to address recommendation from our 2012 report, VHA \\nimplemented system patches while a new system is in development.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\9\\\\ Audit of VHA\\'s Support Service Contracts, November 19, 2014; \\nAudit of VHA Acquisition and Management of Prosthetic Limbs, March 30, \\n2012.\\n    \\\\10\\\\ Audit of VHA\\'s Prosthetics Supply Inventory Management, \\nMarch 30, 2012.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    In FY 2012, the Office of Management and Budget stated Government \\nspending for support service functions quadrupled over the past decade. \\nPrevious OIG audits identified recurring systemic deficiencies in \\nvirtually all phases of VHA\\'s contracting processes. In our \\nNovember 2014 audit report, we noted that VHA\\'s support service \\ncontract costs increased 60 percent from approximately $503 million for \\nabout 5,100 contracts in FY 2012 to just over $805 million for about \\n4,700 support service contracts in FY 2014. VHA did not have effective \\ninternal controls or follow existing controls to ensure adequate \\ndevelopment, award, monitoring, and documentation of support service \\ncontracts. The contract deficiencies included insufficient \\ndocumentation of key contract development and award decisions, \\nassurance that paid invoice amounts were correct and funds were de-\\nobligated following the contract completion, and a complete history of \\ncontract actions in VA\\'s mandatory Electronic Contract Management \\nSystem.\\n    During FYs 2012 and 2013, we estimated VA made about 15,600 \\npotential unauthorized commitments valued at approximately $85.6 \\nmillion, which require ratification actions. Unauthorized commitments \\nare agreements that are not binding solely because the Government \\nrepresentative who made them lacked the authority to enter into that \\nagreement on behalf of the Government. Unauthorized commitments include \\ncommitments made by individuals who do not have valid warrants or \\nexceed the limitations of their warrant authority. The significant \\nnumber of unauthorized commitments we identified exemplifies persistent \\nweaknesses in VA procurement practices and especially using purchase \\ncards. Further, the practice of institutional ratifications does not \\nhold individuals accountable for this serious offense.\\n                        va construction program\\n    In FY 2014, we issued a report on VA\\'s management of several health \\ncare center leases that found that VA\\'s process was not effective and \\ndid not fully account for expenditures.\\\\11\\\\ Among our recommendations \\nwas to establish adequate guidance for management of the procurement \\nprocess of large-scale build-to-lease facilities and establish central \\ncost tracking to ensure transparency and accurate reporting on health \\ncare center expenditures.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\11\\\\ Review of VA\\'s Management of Health Care Center Leases, \\nOctober 22, 2013.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    We also reviewed VHA\\'s non-recurring maintenance program where \\nexpenditures increased from $824 million in FY 2008 to $1.8 billion in \\nFY 2013.\\\\12\\\\ We reported that VHA did not have an adequate process to \\ntrack how much of the over $1.8 billion in non-recurring maintenance \\nfunds medical facilities spent to address its nearly $10.7 billion \\nfacility maintenance backlog.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\12\\\\ Audit of Non-Recurring Maintenance Program, May 7, 2014.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    In FY 2013 we reported VHA did not adequately review individual \\nprojects to ensure proper use of minor construction funds.\\\\13\\\\ \\nSpecifically, VA medical facilities integrated design and construction \\nwork for 7 of 30 minor construction projects into 3 combined projects \\nthat exceeded the $10 million minor construction spending limit. This \\noccurred because VHA did not effectively oversee project execution \\nafter funding was distributed to individual project accounts. As a \\nresult, VHA violated the Antideficiency Act by integrating design and \\nconstruction work for five minor construction projects into two \\ncombined projects by exceeding the $10 million minor construction \\nthreshold. VHA would have likely committed a third Antideficiency Act \\nviolation if we had not identified two other minor construction \\nprojects that integrated design and construction work into a single \\ncontract solicitation, which VHA suspended while in the award process.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\13\\\\ Review of Minor Construction Program, December 17, 2012.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                   information technology management\\n    VA launched the Project Management Accountability System (PMAS) in \\nJune 2009. We followed-up to assess whether the Office of Information \\nand Technology (OIT) took effective actions to address recommendations \\nwe made to strengthen PMAS in two prior audit reports.\\\\14\\\\ We reported \\nin 2015 that OIT has taken steps to improve PMAS, but more than 5 years \\nafter its launch, OIT has not fully infused PMAS with the discipline \\nand accountability necessary for effective oversight of IT development \\nprojects. Two OIT offices did not adequately perform planning and \\ncompliance reviews. The PMAS Business Office (PBO) still had Federal \\nemployee vacancies and the PMAS Dashboard lacked a complete audit trail \\nof baseline data. Project managers continued to struggle with capturing \\nincrement costs and project teams were not reporting costs related to \\nenhancements on the PMAS Dashboard.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\14\\\\ Follow-Up Audit of the Information Technology Project \\nManagement Accountability System, January 22, 2015; Audit of the \\nProject Management and Accountability System Implementation, August 29, \\n2011.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    These conditions occurred because OIT did not provide adequate \\noversight to ensure our prior recommendations were sufficiently \\naddressed and that controls were operating as intended. OIT also did \\nnot adequately define enhancements in the PMAS Guide. As a result, VA\\'s \\nportfolio of IT development projects was potentially being managed at \\nan unnecessarily high risk.\\n    Since approximately 2000, VA has made a number of unsuccessful \\nefforts to replace VHA\\'s Veterans Health Information Systems and \\nTechnology Architecture. VA canceled the Replacement Scheduling \\nApplication (RSA) project.\\\\15\\\\ A March 2009 memo from the Under \\nSecretary for Health to the Acting Assistant Secretary for Information \\nand Technology stated that the RSA project had not developed a single \\nscheduling capability it could provide to the field nor was there any \\nexpectation of delivering a capability in the near future. The memo \\nalso stated that after more than 5 years and a cost of more than $75 \\nmillion, the RSA failed to deliver a useable product because of \\nineffective planning and oversight.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\15\\\\ Review of the Award and Administration of Task Orders Issued \\nby the Department of Veterans Affairs for the Replacement Scheduling \\nApplication Development Program, August 26, 2009\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    We reported that because the RSA project lacked defined \\nrequirements, an information technology architecture, and a properly \\nexecuted acquisition plan, RSA was at significant risk of failure from \\nthe start. We suggested that VA needed experienced personnel to plan \\nand manage the development and implementation of complex information \\ntechnology projects effectively. We also suggested that a system to \\nmonitor and identify problems affecting the progress of projects could \\nsupport VA\\'s leadership in making effective and timely decisions to \\neither redirect or terminate troubled projects. Since the cancelation \\nof the RSA project, VA has continued to seek solutions to replace its \\ncurrent scheduling system.\\n    In another OIG audit we assessed OIT\\'s management of VHA\\'s Pharmacy \\nReengineering program (PRE), and reported that OIT needed stronger \\naccountability over cost, schedule, and scope.\\\\16\\\\ We also reviewed \\nallegations that VHA\\'s Chief Business Office (CBO) violated \\nappropriations law by improperly obligating a total of $96 million of \\nmedical support and compliance funds to finance the development of the \\nHealth Care Claims Processing System (HCCPS).\\\\17\\\\ We substantiated that \\n$92.5 million was improperly obligated, The CBO spent approximately \\n$73.8 million and $18.7 million remains obligated. Medical support and \\ncare appropriations are only authorized for administering medical, \\nconstruction, supply, and research activities. By using MS&C \\nappropriations, VHA avoided competing with other VA projects for IT \\nappropriations.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\16\\\\ Audit of Pharmacy Reengineering Software Development Project, \\nDecember 23, 2013.\\n    \\\\17\\\\ Review of Alleged Misuse of VA Funds To Develop the Health \\nCare Claims Processing System, March 2, 2015.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                    information technology security\\n    In May 2014, we published our annual assessment of VA compliance \\nwith the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and \\napplicable National Institute of Standards and Technology \\nguidelines.\\\\18\\\\ We contracted with the independent accounting firm \\nCliftonLarsonAllen LLP to perform this audit. We found that VA had made \\nprogress developing policies and procedures but still faced challenges \\nimplementing components of its agency-wide information security risk \\nmanagement program to meet FISMA requirements. While some improvements \\nwere noted, FISMA audits continued to identify significant deficiencies \\nrelated to access controls, configuration management controls, \\ncontinuous monitoring controls, and service continuity practices \\ndesigned to protect mission-critical systems.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\18\\\\ VA\\'s Federal Information Security Management Act Audit for \\nFiscal Year 2013, May 29, 2014.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Weaknesses in access and configuration management controls resulted \\nfrom VA not fully implementing security control standards on all \\nservers and network devices. VA has not effectively implemented \\nprocedures to identify and remediate system security vulnerabilities on \\nnetwork devices, database and server platforms, and Web applications \\nVA-wide. Further, VA has not remediated approximately 6,000 outstanding \\nsystem security risks in its corresponding Plans of Action and \\nMilestones to improve its overall information security posture.\\n    As a result of the FY 2014 consolidated financial statement audit, \\nCliftonLarsonAllen LLP concluded a material weakness still exists in \\nVA\\'s information security program. We recommended the Executive in \\nCharge for Information and Technology implement comprehensive measures \\nto mitigate security vulnerabilities affecting VA\\'s mission-critical \\nsystems. We plan to issue the FY 2014 FISMA audit results shortly.\\n                           criminal activity\\n    Threats and Assaults--Since October 1, 2013, we conducted more than \\n1,000 preliminary inquiries and full investigations relating to threats \\nmade against or by VA employees and against facilities resulting in 44 \\narrests and/or involuntary commitments. Although most threat-related \\ninvestigations do not result in judicial action, we take all threats \\nseriously. We also conducted 17 assault investigations resulting in 24 \\narrests, and 9 sexual assault investigations resulting in 4 arrests. \\nThese investigations involved veterans assaulting VA employees and \\nother veterans, as well as VA employees assaulting veterans and other \\nVA employees. In one investigation, a veteran was sentenced to 2 years\\' \\nincarceration after pleading guilty to threatening to kill Atlanta, \\nGeorgia, VAMC medical staff by going to his residence to get a weapon, \\nreturn, and shoot them in the head if he was not granted a 100 percent \\ndisability pension rating. The veteran left the VAMC and before he \\ncould return he became engaged in a shootout with local police at his \\nresidence after the officers responded to a domestic disturbance call.\\n    Drug Diversion--Since October 1, 2013, we have arrested 184 \\nindividuals who diverted and/or sold controlled and non-controlled \\nsubstances from and at VA facilities. Among them were VA health care \\nproviders who stole pain medications intended for specific patients and \\nconsumed them while on-duty and delivering patient care; patients who \\nsold their prescribed drugs to other VA patients; individuals who sold \\ncontraband drugs such as heroin at VA facilities; and employees of \\ndelivery services, including the U.S. Postal Service, who stole \\nprescription drugs intended for VA patients. As a result of one such \\ninvestigation, a Long Beach, California, VAMC pharmacist, three \\npharmacy technicians, and a distribution supervisor pled guilty to \\nstealing more than 16,000 tablets of prescription medications.\\n    Identity Theft, Procurement Fraud, and Improper Payments--We have \\nrecently added headquarters staff to focus our national efforts to \\ncombat identity theft, procurement fraud, and improper payments \\nresulting from criminal conspiracy. During this time period, we \\narrested 16 individuals who stole veterans\\' personally identifiable \\ninformation (PII) for a variety of criminal schemes, but primarily to \\nfacilitate Federal income tax refund fraud exceeding $6 million. In one \\ninvestigation, a former VAMC clerk and a VA volunteer were sentenced to \\n72 months\\' and 48 months\\' respectively for exchanging VA patients\\' PII \\nfor money and illicit drugs.\\n    As a result of an OIG investigation, 14 individuals were prosecuted \\non bribery charges, including an engineer at the East Orange, New \\nJersey, VAMC who was convicted of conspiring with a contractor to \\ndefraud VA of more than $6 million. In another investigation, a former \\nVA contracting officer in Palo Alto, California, VAMC, was convicted \\nfor accepting more than $100,000 in cash, vacations, and other items of \\nvalue in exchange for her influence in awarding contracts. To date, \\nthis investigation has resulted in criminal charges against two other \\nVA employees and one contractor. In a third investigation, we convicted \\nthe former Director of the Cleveland, Ohio, and Dayton, Ohio, VAMCs on \\n64 corruption-related charges related to the sale of confidential \\ninformation about VA contracts and projects to multiple contractors; \\none of the contractors used the inside information to obtain an \\nadvantage in securing a contract valued at approximately $20 million.\\n    We have recently initiated efforts to identify and thwart national \\ncriminal schemes to redirect VA benefits by defrauding the multi-agency \\neBenefits system, as well as to detect billing fraud in non-VA fee care \\nand overseas medical care programs. One of our investigations, resulted \\nin the conviction of a Department of Defense employee living in Germany \\nfor defrauding VA and the Office of Personnel Management of more than \\n$2.2 million in medical reimbursements, which exposed considerable \\nvulnerabilities in VA\\'s overseas medical care program.\\n    Eligibility Fraud in Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business \\n(SDVOSB) Program--We continue to aggressively pursue allegations of \\neligibility fraud involving companies and individuals taking advantage \\nof set-aside contracting in VA\\'s SDVOSB program supporting VHA \\nhealthcare delivery requirements. To date, our investigations have \\nresulted in the indictment of 45 individuals and 5 companies. \\nDefendants have been sentenced to a cumulative total of imprisonment \\nexceeding 26 years and fines and restitution exceeding $14 million. \\nSixty individuals and companies deemed culpable of committing this type \\nof fraud have been referred to VA for suspension and debarment action \\nto exclude them from receiving future contracts.\\n    Beneficiary Travel Fraud--We have worked closely with VA to \\nidentify, investigate, prosecute, and deter fraud associated with VA\\'s \\nbeneficiary travel reimbursement program, whose expenditures approached \\n$797 million in FY 2014. We believe our efforts with VA to enhance VA\\'s \\ndata mining efforts and develop more effective warning posters to be \\nplaced where veterans submit claims for these beneficiary travel \\nbenefits, coupled with increased media attention resulting from DOJ \\npress releases, have played a significant role in deterring such crime. \\nVA reports expending nearly $43 million fewer dollars in this program \\nin FY 2014 than in FY 2012.\\n                               conclusion\\n    The issues confronting VHA are issues that the OIG has long \\nreported as serious and in need of attention at the VA Central Office, \\nat the Veteran Integrated Service Network, and at the facility levels. \\nThe rededication by senior leadership and renewed commitment by \\nemployees to meet the expectations of veterans and the Nation is a step \\nin the right direction. The OIG will continue to report on these issues \\nuntil we see that change has occurred and that it is not just a \\ntemporary adjustment.\\n\\n    Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, Mr. Abe and I will be \\npleased to answer your questions.\\n\\n    Chairman Isakson. Thank you, Dr. Daigh.\\n    Dr. Clancy.\\n\\n STATEMENT OF CAROLYN M. CLANCY, M.D., INTERIM UNDER SECRETARY \\nFOR HEALTH, VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF \\n VETERANS AFFAIRS; ACCOMPANIED BY STEPHEN W. WARREN, EXECUTIVE \\nIN CHARGE AND CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, OFFICE OF INFORMATION \\n                           TECHNOLOGY\\n\\n    Dr. Clancy. Good afternoon, Chairman Isakson, Ranking \\nMember Blumenthal, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for \\nthe opportunity to participate in this hearing and discuss \\nVHA\\'s inclusion on the GAO\\'s 2015 High-Risk Series Report. I am \\naccompanied by Mr. Stephen Warren, the Department\\'s Chief \\nInformation Officer.\\n    The Secretary and I, along with all of our senior \\nleadership, are strongly committed to developing long-term \\nsolutions that mitigate risks to the timeliness, cost \\neffectiveness, quality, and safety of the VA health care \\nsystem. In 2014, we established a Blueprint for Excellence, a \\ndetailed road map for the evolution of health services provided \\nby VHA. It provides guidance for the alignment of resources to \\ntransform VA health services from being provider-centric to \\nveteran-centric and begins to offer a pathway for addressing \\nGAO\\'s five high-risk areas.\\n    VHA has the capacity to address the problems GAO clearly \\nidentified in the report. I have directed all senior leaders in \\nVHA to identify resource needs in their areas of control to \\nensure that our strategic plans support resolution of GAO\\'s \\nhigh-risk areas. Our budget cycle is built to fund the actions \\nnecessary to support these strategic goals.\\n    In the coming months, we will be refining our corrective \\nactions plans for each high-risk area and will be using input \\nfrom the GAO, the Inspector General, and our other advisory \\ngroups to identify root causes and develop critical actions.\\n    With regard to national policies and processes, VHA is \\nintegrating our policy and operations together, our leaders \\ntogether across major business lines, such as primary care, \\nsurgical care, mental health, and so forth, so that policy and \\nimplementation are much more closely linked. Importantly, \\nhealth care is a pretty dynamic enterprise, so our policies \\nhave to be flexible enough to accommodate evolving standards \\nfor clinical care as well as requisite clinical judgment. We \\nwill continue to improve our processes and their implementation \\nto address GAO and IG findings and ensure we provide timely, \\nhigh-quality care to all veterans.\\n    With respect to oversight and accountability, we recently \\nrestructured the Office of the Medical Inspector into an \\nintegral element of our oversight and compliance programs and \\nthat office\\'s policies and procedures were revised to place a \\nhigher premium on quality and safety. Now, the Medical \\nInspector reports directly to the Under Secretary for Health, \\nand this is a first foundational block in our developing a \\nrobust internal audit process.\\n    Concerning information technology, we are modernizing VA\\'s \\nElectronic Health Record, which is the most widely used \\nelectronic health record in this country. We are developing a \\nnew web-based enterprise health management platform which will \\nallow us to continue to share data on millions of \\nservicemembers and veterans, both with the Department of \\nDefense as well as community partners.\\n    Human capital training is critical to ensure veterans \\nreceive safe care, and our front-line providers need to have \\neffective training on national policies and procedures. The \\nbottom line is, our training has to empower employees and make \\nit easy for every employee to do the right thing every time.\\n    Concerning resource needs and allocation priorities, we are \\nimplementing an enterprise-wide planning, programming, budget, \\nand execution program to make sure that planning and \\nprioritization are tightly linked with budget and execution. \\nThat has not been the case, I would have to say. This approach \\ndoes include training in human capital requirements.\\n    Monitoring of corrective action plans and progress will be \\nreported on a regular basis. As we implement corrective \\nmeasures, we will be providing GAO with documentation of our \\nprogress and we will be seeking input from the GAO and the \\nOffice of the Inspector General to ensure that our actions are \\nmeeting the intent of their recommendations. We are committed \\nto long-term durable solutions and sustained improvement in the \\nhigh-risk areas.\\n    By way of positive news, from the first quarter of fiscal \\nyear 2014 to the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, 71 percent \\nof our facilities have made meaningful improvement as judged by \\nour comprehensive system of measures, which is called SAIL. I \\nlook forward to showing you other improvements we have made.\\n    In addition to the five high-risk areas, GAO\\'s report \\nmentioned that VA has many recommendations that have yet to be \\nfully resolved, and VHA and GAO have established a new process \\nto enhance our collaboration for reviewing open recommendations \\nand documentation that GAO needs to assess those completed \\nactions.\\n    In conclusion, I want to say that the review and assessment \\nof our programs is something that we welcome as part of our \\ncommitment to providing the best health care to veterans. VHA \\nmust operate with accountability, with integrity, reliability, \\nand transparency to earn and maintain the trust of veterans, \\nstewards of the system, and the public. We need to build for \\nsuccess but at the same time be ever vigilant for weaknesses, \\nfailure, and opportunities to eliminate waste. We look forward \\nto building a better and stronger system for our Nation\\'s \\nveterans and demonstrating substantial progress in the five \\nhigh-risk areas. This transformation we are undertaking \\nrepresents probably the greatest enhancement in health care for \\nveterans that will be made in a generation and we are taking \\nthis very seriously.\\n    This concludes my testimony. We would be happy to answer \\nyour questions.\\n    [The prepared statement of Dr. Clancy follows:]\\n Prepared Statement of Dr. Carolyn M. Clancy, Interim Under Secretary \\nfor Health, Veterans Health Administration, U.S. Department of Veterans \\n                                Affairs\\n    Good afternoon, Chairman Isakson, Ranking Member Blumenthal, and \\nMembers of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to participate \\nin this hearing and to discuss the Veterans Health Administration\\'s \\n(VHA) inclusion on the Government Accountability Office\\'s (GAO) 2015 \\nHigh Risk Series report. I am accompanied today by Stephen Warren, \\nExecutive in Charge for the Office of Information Technology and Chief \\nInformation Officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\\n    We welcome VHA\\'s inclusion in the 2015 High Risk Series report. The \\nreport comes at a critical time for VHA and highlights issues that are \\nimportant to Veterans and the public. In many ways, VHA is on the \\ncutting-edge of the health care industry. We recognize that we need to \\nmake significant improvements. VA recently implemented important \\nchanges to remedy many of the issues and concerns identified by GAO. In \\nSeptember 2014, VA began the MyVA initiative, which focuses VA\\'s \\nefforts to view customer service from a Veteran\\'s perspective. With \\nthis initiative, VHA\\'s future goals are to ensure that:\\n\\n    1. Veterans have a clear understanding of VA and where to go for \\nwhat they need within any of VHA\\'s facilities;\\n    2. VA employees are empowered with the authority, knowledge, and \\ntools they need to solve problems and take action, and;\\n    3. The products and services that VHA delivers to Veterans are \\nintegrated within the organization.\\n\\n    VA will continue to identify and rectify issues within our \\nDepartment. We respect GAO\\'s work and take their recommendations \\nregarding VA programs and policies very seriously. Therefore, we share \\nGAO\\'s goal of ensuring Veterans are provided with the high quality \\nhealth care they have earned and deserve.\\n    GAO categorized its concerns about VA\\'s ability to ensure the \\ntimeliness, cost-effectiveness, quality, and safety of the health care \\nthe department provides into five broad areas: (1) policies and \\nprocesses: (2) oversight and accountability: (3) information \\ntechnology: (4) training for VA staff; and (5) resource needs and \\nallocation priorities. VHA is taking the following steps to address \\nthese high risk areas GAO has identified.\\nPolicies and Processes\\n    VHA has subject matter experts in all program areas responsible for \\ndeveloping and maintaining national policies. The subjects of these \\nnational policies can range from something as extremely complex as \\norgan procurement for transplants, to something as fundamental as the \\nhandbook on employee uniforms. Before VHA issues a national policy, the \\npolicy undergoes thorough review and approval to ensure it is compliant \\nwith law and regulation. During policy development, subject matter \\nexperts obtain input from relevant VA stakeholders. All national \\npolicies undergo labor and management review. In addition, all policies \\nundergo an extensive concurrence process before they are published for \\nnational implementation.\\n    Importantly, health care is a dynamic industry, and our policies \\nmust be flexible enough to accommodate evolving standards for clinical \\ncare. In addition, VHA policies strive to accommodate clinical care \\nstandards that can vary across the country. We will continue to improve \\nour processes and implementation of policies to address the GAO and \\nOffice of the Inspector General (OIG) findings.\\nOversight and Accountability\\n    The Office of the Medical Inspector (OMI) is an integral element of \\nVHA\\'s oversight and compliance program. Responsible for assessing the \\nquality of VA health care through site-specific investigations and \\nsystem-wide assessments, OMI reports directly to the Under Secretary \\nfor Health. OMI\\'s policies and procedures were restructured in 2014 to \\nensure that health care quality and patient safety remain a primary and \\nconstant focus.\\n    OMI exercises its traditional oversight role by investigating \\nconcerns about the quality of health care that VHA provides to \\nVeterans. These concerns may come to our attention via VHA\\'s internal \\nmonitoring of activities, complaints from individual Veterans, issues \\nraised by Members of Congress, or whistleblower allegations referred by \\nthe Office of Special Counsel (OSC). In carrying out these \\ninvestigations, OMI conducts record reviews, site visits, interviews, \\nand surveys. In each instance, OMI produces comprehensive reports \\ncontaining recommendations for quality improvements to VA medical \\ncenters, Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), and VHA Program \\nOffices, and then works with them to ensure that corrective actions are \\ncompleted. OMI\\'s analyses have changed local and national health care \\npolicy and procedures.\\n    OMI meets monthly with the Assistant Inspector General, Office of \\nHealth Care Inspections, to review cases and health care issues that \\neach are addressing to share information about ongoing and planned \\ninspections, and to avoid duplication of effort. In addition, OMI meets \\nregularly with OSC to review the status of whistleblower \\ninvestigations, and to discuss schedules for reports and other \\ndeliverables. These meetings have improved communication between OSC \\nand VA on investigative findings, ensuring complaints are thoroughly \\nexamined and that whistleblowers receive the protections they are \\nentitled to under the law.\\n    As part of VHA\\'s ``Blueprint for Excellence,\\'\\' OMI is expanding \\nbeyond its traditional investigative functions to create an internal \\naudit capability within VHA, based on the core elements of risk \\nassessment, testing of critical control measures, and for-cause \\ninvestigation. The information and data gathered through audit and \\nassessment activities helps VHA to better identify system \\nvulnerabilities and manage risks across VHA.\\n    Last summer, VA established the Office of Accountability Review \\n(OAR) to ensure that appropriate leadership accountability actions are \\ntaken when facility leaders are implicated in findings by the OIG, OMI, \\nor other oversight bodies. OAR reports directly to the Secretary and \\nthus functions independently of VHA.\\n    VHA also has other offices that have roles in VHA\\'s integrity, \\noversight, and compliance activities. Taken collectively, these \\nactivities help ensure integrity and accountability across VA\\'s health \\ncare system. The improved cooperation we are fostering will help \\novercome some of VHA\\'s current challenges in providing effective health \\ncare oversight, and support efforts to restore Veterans\\' and the \\npublic\\'s trust.\\nInformation Technology\\n    VHA runs the largest health care system in the country; delivering \\nthe quality care Veterans deserve is not possible without innovative \\ninformation technology and data sharing. VA\\'s Electronic Health Record \\n(EHR), VistA,\\\\1\\\\ is the most widely used EHR in the United States, and \\nVA is working rapidly to modernize it. VA is developing a new web \\napplication and services platform called the Enterprise Health \\nManagement Platform (eHMP). eHMP is the VistA application clinicians \\nwill use during their clinical interactions with Veterans. eHMP brings \\nexciting new features to the clinician, including Google-like search \\ncapabilities and information buttons that help clinicians find needed \\ninformation much faster than current systems. VA is already piloting \\neHMP, and expects to deploy it to 30 sites by the end of the calendar \\nyear, with full rollout--including regular updates--over the next three \\nyears.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    VA continues to work with the Department of Defense (DOD) on health \\ndata interoperability, but it is important to note that the two \\nDepartments already share health care data on millions of \\nServicemembers and Veterans. In fact, the two Departments share more \\nhealth data than any other health care entities in the Nation. In \\naddition to sharing health care data, VA and DOD have also paved the \\nway for standardizing health care data, so that regardless of what \\nsystem a clinician uses, the data is available in the right place and \\nin the right way; for example, Tylenol and acetaminophen appear in the \\nsame place in the record because the system understands, through our \\ndata standardization, that they are the same medication. Today, VA and \\nDOD clinicians can use the Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) to see VA and DOD \\ndata on a single screen in a Servicemember or Veteran\\'s record. \\nEventually, eHMP will replace JLV and will allow clinicians to see VA, \\nDOD, and third-party provider data in their regular clinical care tool.\\nTraining for VA Staff\\n    VHA understands that training is a critical element of development \\nand we are committed to offering innovative training that utilizes \\nclinical simulation, medical modeling, and other emerging technologies \\nfor our clinical, administrative and technical staff. VHA\\'s Employee \\nEducation System holds 13 national and two state system-wide \\naccreditations supporting VHA\\'s clinical/professional continuing \\neducation requirements. With its interagency shared training, VHA \\ncontinues to expand capacity by leveraging learning content offered \\nthrough other Federal agencies. VHA is also partnering with the VA \\nLearning University to improve our training materials and \\nmethodologies. Our priority is to continue to assess target audience \\nsatisfaction, appropriate content level, and various methods of \\ndelivery to improve training outcomes.\\nResource Needs and Allocation Priorities\\n    In order to meet the VA\\'s health care mission most effectively, VHA \\nmust share a customer service perspective that places Veterans\\' needs--\\nand VHA\\'s ability to meet those needs--as paramount. Staff offices must \\nleverage all possible authorities and streamline processes to promote \\nagility compared with the efficiency of the best private sector health \\nsystems. VA and VHA are moving forward with implementing a planning, \\nprogramming, budget and execution program that will ensure our medical \\ncare planning and prioritization drives the budget request and \\nexecution.\\n                               conclusion\\n    Mr. Chairman, VA welcomes the review and assessment of its programs \\nas part of its commitment to providing the best health care to \\nVeterans. We look forward to building a better and stronger Federal \\nagency for our Nation\\'s Veterans. This concludes my testimony. My \\ncolleague and I are prepared to answer any questions you or other \\nMembers of the Committee may have.\\n\\n    Chairman Isakson. Thank you, Dr. Clancy.\\n    Mr. Warren, did you have any comments you wanted to make?\\n    Mr. Warren. No, sir, I am here just in a supportive role.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Just in case she needs some help?\\n    Mr. Warren. Yes, sir.\\n    Chairman Isakson. I think she will probably do fine.\\n    Dr. Clancy, did you read Dr. Daigh\\'s report?\\n    Dr. Clancy. I did, yes.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Dr. Daigh, I want to compliment you on \\nyour testimony.\\n    Dr. Daigh. Thank you, sir.\\n    Chairman Isakson. On page 5--I want Dr. Clancy to listen to \\nthis very closely--as early as 2009, we were--``we\\'\\' being Dr. \\nDaigh\\'s office--reported that VHA improperly paid 37 percent of \\noutpatient fee claims, resulting in $225 million in \\noverpayments and $52 million in underpayments. We estimate that \\n$1.1 billion in overpayments and $260 million in underpayments \\nover the next 5 years if VA does not change their policy. Is \\nthat correct, Dr. Daigh?\\n    Dr. Daigh. Yes, sir.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Dr. Clancy, this last Friday, on a day \\noff, I was joined by the Ranking Member Richard Blumenthal, \\nsome of the Colorado delegation, and some House members. We \\nwent to Denver, CO, where the hospital being built in Denver \\nfor the veterans is 427.5 percent over budget. The planning \\nstarted in 2004 and is about 50 percent finished. It is just \\nironic to me that if the 2009 recommendations to the VHA by Dr. \\nDaigh\\'s office had been followed and resulted, we would save \\n$1.1 billion over 5 years. That is exactly the amount of cost \\noverrun in the hospital in Denver.\\n    The point I want to make is this. The High-Risk List is \\nimportant because it demonstrates to you where you have got a \\nhigh risk for failure or problems in your system. VA is bereft, \\nto me, of any response mechanism within it to respond to crises \\nother than kicking the ball down the field.\\n    Dr. Daigh\\'s recommendations were clear and succinct. VA\\'s \\nproblems are clear and succinct. It would seem to me if I had a \\n$1.1 billion cost overrun in Denver and I had a $1.1 billion \\nrecommendation that I could save over 5 years by just changing \\nmy policy in fee-based care, that I would follow. Why do you \\nthink nothing was done over that 5-year period of time with \\nnon-VA care?\\n    Dr. Clancy. I think what has happened historically, and Dr. \\nDaigh, I think, has been consistently very clear about this, is \\nthat every single one of our facilities was doing the non-VA \\ncare on their own, and as you know, we have now got multiple \\npathways for helping veterans to get care in the community, and \\nmoreover, every year, we were doing a higher and higher volume.\\n    We have an internal Compliance and Business Integrity Unit. \\nThese are certified auditors that help with some of this. I \\nthink there were so many different approaches that there were \\nnot sufficient eyes on making sure that it was done \\nconsistently and reliably. Those processes have been \\nconsolidated as a result of the new law into one central \\nbusiness office, and I am going to be honest and say that we \\nneed a lot of work to get this right.\\n    I have all my senior leaders in D.C. this week so that they \\nhave got a very, very clear idea of what needs to happen, and \\nit has got to happen consistently at every facility. There is \\nno excuse for that.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Dr. Daigh, following up on the non-VA \\ncare, and I read your testimony, did you make specific \\nrecommendations as to what VHA needed to do to correct the \\nproblem?\\n    Dr. Daigh. I will ask Mr. Abe to answer that.\\n    Chairman Isakson. That is fine.\\n    Mr. Abe. Yes, we did----\\n    Chairman Isakson. Before you go any further, did you ever \\nget a response after you made those recommendations from VA?\\n    Mr. Abe. Yes. Yes, we did.\\n    Chairman Isakson. And that response was, this is the way we \\nhave always done it?\\n    Mr. Abe. Not quite, but----\\n    Chairman Isakson. Almost.\\n    Mr. Abe. But, we did make recommendations that, the biggest \\nproblem has to do with how they are organized in regards to \\nthat for every medical facility at the time, they are doing \\ntheir own fee basis claims processing. When you try to \\nestablish policies and procedures and make sure all 150 \\nfacilities understand that, it is very difficult.\\n    When they process claims, we found, like you say, many \\nimproper payments, and a lot of it just had to do with the \\nunderstanding of the Medicare rate or the rates that they are \\nbeing billed and what rates they should be paying.\\n    One of our recommendations that has been implemented and, I \\nthink, is a good first start is that the major thing that we \\nasked is that they get closer to Medicare rates. By \\nlegislation, they had to ask that they could use Medicare \\nrates. So far, I would say about 80 percent, 90 percent of the \\nprocedures, the services that they are providing from non-VA \\ncare is Medicare rates, which makes it a lot easier for them to \\nprocess, although they still have a lot of problems.\\n    Since 2009, when we did that first audit, VA put themselves \\non the Improper Payments Act through their Performance and \\nAccounting Report, and ever since 2009, they have--that \\nprogram, being the non-VA care, has been on the Improper \\nPayments List, under par. The inaccuracies have improved, but \\nthey are still making a lot of improper payments.\\n    Chairman Isakson. I thought that was a crystal clear \\nexample of why being put on this list can have a solution that \\ncan end up benefiting the VA and solving another problem, but \\nmy time is up. We are going to do a second round of questions \\nbecause I want to follow up on this.\\n    Ranking Member Blumenthal.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for \\nbeing here. I thank each of you for your service in the ways \\nthat you have provided invaluable help to this Committee, to \\nveterans, and to the VA.\\n    Let me begin with Dr. Draper. Your testimony is that more \\nthan 100 recommendations from the GAO have not been \\nimplemented, is that correct?\\n    Ms. Draper. That is correct.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Some of those recommendations have to \\ndo with accountability, do they not?\\n    Ms. Draper. That is correct.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Some have to do with training?\\n    Ms. Draper. Mm-hmm.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. These recommendations that have not \\nbeen implemented with respect to training have real life \\nconsequences, do they not?\\n    Ms. Draper. Well, many of our recommendations, whether they \\nare training or for oversight and accountability, have some \\nreal life consequences.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. For example, I noted that in your May \\n2011 report, you found that training of staff responsible for \\ncleaning and reprocessing reusable medical equipment, such as \\nendoscopes and some surgical instruments, was lacking. The \\nfailure to properly clean and reprocess these kinds of \\ninstruments can cause very severe infections, can they not?\\n    Ms. Draper. That is correct.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. In fact, one of the major problems in \\nhealth care in America today is infections that occur within \\nhospitals, is that correct?\\n    Ms. Draper. That is correct.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Yet, the VA has failed to implement a \\nnumber of recommendations having to do with that basic training \\nrequirement, correct?\\n    Ms. Draper. That is correct, and there have been incidents \\nin some VA facilities where that has been a problem.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. In terms of accountability and \\noversight, has the VA exercised sufficient discipline, taken \\nsufficient measures to hold accountable individuals that fail \\nto act properly?\\n    Ms. Draper. One of the things we talk about and one of the \\nareas of putting VHA on the High-Risk List relates to oversight \\nand accountability. We found several concerns there. One was \\nthat VA tends to rely on facility self-reported data. There is \\nno validation of that data and it is often incomplete or \\ninaccurate. We will go into the facilities and find something \\ntotally different.\\n    They do not always audit or provide oversight activities \\nfor making sure that facilities are in compliance with \\nparticular requirements. It is not a very rigorous oversight \\nand accountability process.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Has that improved?\\n    Ms. Draper. We are still seeing some of the same things.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. In answer to my question, the oversight \\naccountability process within the VA is still extremely \\nlacking?\\n    Ms. Draper. We have not seen improvements to the \\nrecommendations we made related to those categories, a lot of \\nthose recommendations still remain open.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Those kinds of failures have real life \\nconsequences, too, do they not?\\n    Ms. Draper. They do. I can give you a perfect example. When \\nwe found the oversight and accountability related to outpatient \\nappointment scheduling you hear this a lot. You see in one VA \\nfacility, the way the processes and policies play out at the \\nlocal level, and there is so much variation from each of the \\nmany VA facilities. In that particular instance, we found \\nfacilities documenting their outpatient appointment times very \\ndifferently, so the wait times data are unreliable. You cannot \\nreally provide oversight on something that is unreliable.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. You cannot hold accountable people for \\nfailing to meet schedules if the scheduling data is unreliable.\\n    Ms. Draper. Another thing, the information technology \\nsystem, the appointments scheduling system, it is prone to user \\nerror. If someone wanted to go in and manipulate the data, it \\nwould not be hard to do.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. I am going to come back. Thank you for \\nyour answers. On the second round, I hope I will be able to \\ncome back to you.\\n    Dr. Daigh, I have read the Veterans Health Administration \\nVA Office of Inspector General review of alleged patient \\ndeaths, et cetera, in the Phoenix Health Care System. It is \\ndated August 26, 2014. Your office prepared it, did they not?\\n    Dr. Daigh. That is correct, yes.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Is that your final report on Phoenix?\\n    Dr. Daigh. There is one aspect of Phoenix that we have not \\nreported on and that is the urology care there. We issued an \\ninterim report on that. Shortly, we will be able to publish a \\nurology care piece.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. That is dated January 28, 2015?\\n    Dr. Daigh. That sounds right, sir.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. I am going to ask that they be made \\npart of the record.\\n    [The information referred to follows:]\\n    Response to Request Arising During the Hearing by Hon. Richard \\n  Blumenthal to John D. Daigh, Jr., M.D., C.P.A., Assistant Inspector \\nGeneral, Office of Healthcare Inspections, Office of Inspector General, \\n                  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\\n\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n    Chairman Isakson. Without objection.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you.\\n    Have you finished your oversight and investigation of other \\nfacilities around the country? There are, I think, 93 of them \\nthat exhibited similar deficiencies; is that correct?\\n    Dr. Daigh. If you are speaking, sir, of the scheduling \\nissue that the Office of Investigations was undertaking, I \\nbelieve that they are still in the process of working with \\nAssistant United States Attorneys (AUSAs) around the country, \\nwhere appropriate, to process that and----\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Did you find prosecutable offenses in \\nthe Phoenix report?\\n    Dr. Daigh. I am not from the Office of Investigations. If \\nyou can ask that question for the record, we can respond, or I \\nam sure we would be willing to come up and brief you on that.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. If you could, I would appreciate it, \\nboth on the record and in a briefing.\\n    Dr. Daigh. Yes, sir.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Did your report lead to disciplinary \\naction against individuals?\\n    Dr. Daigh. I believe that VA has taken disciplinary action \\nagainst a number of individuals. Sir, I mostly focused on the \\nhealth care issues that are involved in Phoenix. When you get \\nto the actual discipline of the leadership or you get to the \\nactual criminal nature of it, that turns out to be an Office of \\nInvestigations feature, so I would need to talk with them or--\\n--\\n    Senator Blumenthal. I will be submitting questions for the \\nrecord that I hope the VA will provide responses in addressing \\nto this Committee.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Senator Hirono.\\n\\n          HON. MAZIE HIRONO, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII\\n\\n    Senator Hirono. I thought you were going to go to one of \\nthe gentlemen.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Ladies first.\\n    Senator Hirono. Oh, thank you. [Laughter.]\\n    Thank you very much.\\n    There are 100 or so recommendations that have not been \\nimplemented, so this is for Dr. Clancy. Have you all \\nprioritized the recommendations as to which ones you would want \\nto tackle first?\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes. I think there was a suggestion or \\ninference made that we are ignoring them and I really would \\nlike to state for the record that we are not ignoring them.\\n    Senator Hirono. Yes.\\n    Dr. Clancy. I do not know if that has been that way in the \\npast. I can only say what we are doing right now.\\n    Some of the recommendations that are very, very thoughtful \\nreflect systemic improvements we would need to make to make \\ndurable changes, which is why, frankly, many of these, or most \\nof these recommendations are so valuable to us, but they do \\ntake time to implement.\\n    Senator Hirono. Yes, I understand that. My question was, \\nagain, of these 100 recommendations, have you established \\npriorities or----\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes, we have.\\n    Senator Hirono. What were the factors that went into \\nestablishing those priorities? Let us say, of the 100 \\nrecommendations, what would your top ten priorities be and what \\nwere the factors that led to those being the top ten?\\n    Dr. Clancy. These are prioritized by how quickly can the \\nproblem be fixed and what are the highest risks to patients, \\nand then coming after that are things that are also important \\nbut take time to implement across a very large health care \\nsystem.\\n    Senator Hirono. Is that list of priorities something you \\ncan share with the Committee?\\n    Dr. Clancy. We can get you that for the record, yes.\\n    Senator Hirono. Getting back to the Chairman\\'s question, \\nthough, with regard to the testimony that he referred to where \\nthere are these huge overpayments as well as underpayments, \\nthat sounds like something that should be addressed pretty \\nfast.\\n    Dr. Clancy. That is something that we have been working on \\nfor a while, and the consolidation of our payments for care in \\nthe community that came about as a result of this law has made \\nthis visible in a far more transparent way and we are working \\nthrough those business processes right now. Some of this has to \\ndo with the fact that individual facilities, as Dr. Daigh \\nnoted, were doing it their own way.\\n    Senator Hirono. Yes.\\n    Dr. Clancy. We have found, for example, that some \\nfacilities actually do not know how to estimate or how to use \\nthe tools that have been provided to estimate what a test or \\nappointment or service in the community is likely to cost, and \\nwe are right in the midst of working through that right now.\\n    Senator Hirono. So, clarifying your processes so that all \\nyour individual VA health centers, et cetera, are not doing \\ntheir own thing, is that high on your list of priorities so \\nthat----\\n    Dr. Clancy. Very, very high. Yes.\\n    Senator Hirono. OK.\\n    Dr. Clancy. That is both a governance as well as a business \\nprocess issue.\\n    Senator Hirono. Good. I think part of it was that there was \\na desire that it should not be a one-size-fits-all, that there \\nis a desire that different communities may want to approach the \\nhealth care needs of their veterans in ways that would be best \\nfor them. But, this led to a very piecemeal, hard to account \\nkind of a system.\\n    Dr. Clancy. I think it is fair to say that when the \\nnetworks were set up about 20 years ago, they were designed as \\nlaboratories of innovation.\\n    Senator Hirono. Yes.\\n    Dr. Clancy. I think that was the phrase that was used a \\nlot, and----\\n    Senator Hirono. It sounded good.\\n    Dr. Clancy [continuing]. That is exactly what we got.\\n    Senator Hirono. Yes.\\n    Dr. Clancy. The flip side of that was a lot of \\ninconsistency. I think we all recognize that health care in \\nyour State is different than health care in Georgia or \\nConnecticut or other States for a whole lot of reasons. We need \\nto have most of our core processes be consistent wherever \\nveterans seek our assistance.\\n    Senator Hirono. I realize that this is a vast, vast health \\ncare system and it is going to take a while to address the \\nvarious changes, and this is why I am so interested in what \\nkind of priorities you have established. Is the homeless \\nveterans issue a high priority?\\n    Dr. Clancy. That is a high priority for us. We have three \\noverarching priorities this year. One is homelessness, because \\nwe are hoping to get as close as possible to functional zero by \\nthe end of this year.\\n    Second is access, whether that is access within our system \\nor access to care in the community and getting that in a timely \\nway.\\n    The third is veteran experience, that it is easy for \\nveterans to navigate.\\n    Senator Hirono. Getting back to the homeless situation, you \\nhave a national call center for homeless veterans and the OIG \\nidentified there were systemic problems with the call center \\nleading to some 40,000 missed opportunities where the center \\ndid not refer calls to VA medical facilities or closed \\nreferrals without ensuring that the homeless veterans were \\nreceiving the services. Is this on your list of----\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes.\\n    Senator Hirono [continuing]. Priorities to change?\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes. In fact, we have separated the homeless \\ncall center from the veterans\\' crisis line. Do you have your \\nboard? I just wanted to make a very brief Public Service \\nAnnouncement about the crisis line because it is so important. \\nI do not think a week goes by when I am not referring veterans \\ndirectly to that line, and I am astonished by how rapidly they \\nreach out and find the veterans and get them the help that they \\nneed.\\n    For a variety of reasons, both to make sure that the \\nhomeless calls were answered, but also to make sure that the \\ncrisis line was not getting overloaded with other calls----\\n    Senator Hirono. OK.\\n    Dr. Clancy [continuing]. Forgive my brief Public Service \\nAnnouncement.\\n    Senator Hirono. I would be happy to put that information in \\nmy own veterans\\' newsletter.\\n    Dr. Clancy. We will get you a link. We will be happy to do \\nthat.\\n    Senator Hirono. Thank you.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Isakson. You are going to get enough criticism. \\nYou ought to be allowed to brag a little bit in the hearing. We \\nappreciate what you are doing. The hotline is a great service \\nto our veterans and it does a great job.\\n    Dr. Clancy. Thank you.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Senator Sullivan.\\n\\n          HON. DAN SULLIVAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA\\n\\n    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to \\nstart by just commenting on the work of the Committee. I want \\nto compliment Chairman Isakson and Ranking Member Blumenthal. \\nYou know, one of the things that, at least in my short time in \\nthe Congress, this is a committee that is very bipartisan in \\nterms of its approach, in terms of what we are trying to \\nachieve. I think that that stems from the leadership on both \\nsides of the aisle, certainly, but also stems from the mission \\nthat we all recognize is so important, to take care of our \\nveterans and that I know all of you recognize.\\n    Sometimes these committees, you can have an opportunity for \\npeople to come here and kind of pound you on something like \\nthis. I think the better approach is probably to just figure \\nout what the heck is going on.\\n    Dr. Clancy, when I looked at your testimony, I was a bit \\ntroubled. The Secretary mentioned that he is fine to be on the \\nlist. He certainly wants to improve. But, your testimony seems \\nto lack a focus. It is four pages, double spaced. It talks a \\nlot about MyVA, which is a promising initiative, but I do not \\nthink that is the road to getting off the list.\\n    Let me just ask a couple of questions, and in some ways, \\nthey are a follow-up of Senator Hirono\\'s questions, which is \\nhow seriously is the VA, VHA, taking the issue that you are on \\nthis list? It is not a good list to be on. More importantly, \\nshe asked about priorities. You gave kind of broad priorities. \\nWhat are the priorities to actually address the issues that got \\nyou on the list?\\n    Dr. Clancy. We are taking this very, very seriously. \\nFrankly, what I find personally most valuable, as do my \\ncolleagues, about being on the High-Risk List is getting at the \\nroot causes of how did we get here.\\n    Senator Sullivan. Right.\\n    Dr. Clancy. There are two ways to look at problems. One is \\nvery specific problems that have been very clearly laid out for \\nus in the past, and that is ongoing work.\\n    The second is to say, what is wrong with this picture and \\nhow did we get here, and that is a key part of realignment that \\nwe are doing internally within VHA. I would agree with you, I \\ndo not think the written statement was as well written as it \\ncould have been, and for that, I offer apologies. We would be \\nhappy, actually, to amend it for the record if that were an \\nopportunity.\\n    Senator Sullivan. I think it is important. When you were \\njust asked on priorities, you talked about homelessness, \\naccess, veterans\\' experience. I think I, certainly, am one who \\nis going to be very focused on helping work with the VA to \\nachieve those. But, it does not go back to the more specific \\nissues----\\n    Dr. Clancy. Correct.\\n    Senator Sullivan [continuing]. That put you on the list in \\nthe first place. What are the priorities that you are going to \\nundertake to address the issues that were laid out in the GAO \\nlisting of your agency?\\n    Dr. Clancy. Our priorities are a serious leadership \\ncommitment that we are moving beyond, if you have seen one VA, \\nyou have seen one VA. Yes, there are local differences. The \\nbuildings look a little bit different. But, the core processes \\nhave to be very consistent and standardized. It is very easy \\nfor me to say this. Making it happen and executing to that is \\ngoing to take some time.\\n    Capacity and the resources and, frankly, being clear to the \\nCongress about what we need to build the capacity to meet \\nveterans\\' needs is very high on our list. That is why you have \\nheard from the Secretary----\\n    Senator Sullivan. Yes.\\n    Dr. Clancy [continuing]. From me and others about what we \\nneed for hiring, what we need for space, and so forth. We \\nrecognize that there is also a backlog.\\n    Oversight and accountability is critically important. We \\nhave a lot of the pieces in place and I would submit that they \\nhave been too fragmented and need to be better integrated to \\nrise to the challenges before us.\\n    Frankly, being transparent with the public and trying to \\nget to a place where we are reliable, so we are posting how we \\nare doing on wait times every 2 weeks for the public to see. We \\nare also posting our results on a comprehensive system of \\nmetrics, which is how it is done in hospitals, outpatient care, \\nefficiency, and so forth. But, that is available for the public \\nto see every quarter.\\n    Senator Sullivan. Right.\\n    Dr. Clancy. I will take Ms. Draper\\'s comment about self-\\nreported data very, very seriously. We have also built some \\ntrigger tools so that when our people who work with the data \\ncentrally are seeing very funny signals, they actually let the \\nfacility know in real time. They do not wait for them to go \\nlook for this report. They actually send them an e-mail to say, \\nwe are seeing some funky things going on here and you need to \\ninvestigate what is going on with the scheduling.\\n    These are early, and, I would argue, fundamental and \\nimportant steps, but that is the building block on which we are \\nmoving forward.\\n    Senator Sullivan. Thank you.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I will have some additional \\nquestions for the record the panel can----\\n    Dr. Clancy. That would be great. I do need to tell you, \\nLittle Rock has actually made tremendous progress and I am very \\nproud of that, so, since we are your homestate.\\n    Senator Sullivan. Well, I am actually from Alaska, so--\\n    Dr. Clancy. Oh, I apologize. I got you confused. \\n[Laughter.]\\n    Senator Sullivan. Maybe I will----\\n    Dr. Clancy. I will save that for Senator Boozman.\\n    Senator Sullivan. At least you did not confuse me for \\nSenator Tillis, which happens a lot. [Laughter.]\\n    Thank you very much for your kind words.\\n    Dr. Clancy. Well, if you see me hiding under the table, you \\nknow why.\\n    Senator Sullivan. That is OK.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Thank you, Senator Sullivan.\\n    Senator Manchin.\\n\\n       HON. JOE MANCHIN, U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA\\n\\n    Senator Manchin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all \\nfor being here.\\n    It seems like we are just piling on now. All of us have \\nproblems. I will give you a specific one and it is in Beckley, \\nWV. I think you all just heard about that. This has been going \\non for quite some time and I will go through the specifics.\\n    It seems like that we are all having problems understanding \\nwhy no one is being held accountable or actions have not been \\ntaken against the responsible parties. It is just ongoing with \\nthe one in Beckley, as I said. The Office of Special Counsel \\nsubstantiated allegations of switching antipsychotic drugs \\nbased solely on cost. They know they are doing it. The doctors \\nare saying, prescribe the drug. They make a decision at the \\nexecutive level. It is pushed down to the pharmacist. They \\ndispense an alternate drug that is much cheaper because they \\nsay they do not have the money to pay. This has been going on, \\nand it the only one we have had this report, but for so long.\\n    I guess I would just ask, Dr. Clancy, what does VA have in \\nplace to resolve these problems or make sure they do not \\ncontinue, and why would anyone let it go on?\\n    Dr. Clancy. As you know, and I think your staff spoke with \\nstaff from our Office of Medical Inspector earlier today----\\n    Senator Manchin. Right.\\n    Dr. Clancy [continuing]. What you have just described is \\nexactly correct. It turns out that some of the proven therapies \\nfor psychosis actually are sometimes better than the newer, \\nmore expensive ones, but what was absolutely not supposed to \\nhappen was a mandate, and veterans who were doing well on one \\nof the newer treatments were not supposed to be switched \\narbitrarily----\\n    Senator Manchin. They never got it----\\n    Dr. Clancy. Right. No, that is exactly right----\\n    Senator Manchin [continuing]. Because it was all based on \\ncost.\\n    Dr. Clancy. Right, and that was the wrong thing to do and \\nwe are going to be taking corrective actions to make sure that \\nthat does not happen and that there is a physician on the \\nPharmacy and Therapy Committee at Beckley, which has not been \\nthe case.\\n    Senator Manchin. We seem to jump out of the fire into the \\nfrying pan. It keeps going on, back and forth, the problems \\nthat we are running into. We had another clinic, a satellite of \\nthe Beckley clinic, that was closed, and we are trying to make \\nsure we get services down in the rural part of the State in \\nGreenbrier County.\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes.\\n    Senator Manchin. I think we have worked with you on that, \\nor are trying to work with you to try to get some help down in \\nthere.\\n    But, we, you know, if there is incompetency at any level, \\nit seems like VA has a hard time getting rid of that, and I do \\nnot know why your system is so protective versus the military. \\nHeck, they can get rid of people easier than you all can, I \\nthink.\\n    Dr. Clancy. I do not actually know how that works. What I \\nknow in health care is that many people believe that you want \\nto be careful about keeping punitive disciplinary actions \\nseparate from people reporting problems that they see, because \\nif people are afraid that if they report problems, they might \\nbe punished, they will not report them.\\n    Senator Manchin. Let me go to the----\\n    Dr. Clancy. I do not know if I am being clear.\\n    Senator Manchin. I----\\n    Dr. Clancy. We will be taking appropriate disciplinary \\naction.\\n    Senator Manchin. We will get together, I guess. We have a \\nproblem there. You and I will talk, maybe personally, on this.\\n    Dr. Clancy. Great.\\n    Senator Manchin. Dr. Daigh, on prescription drug concerns, \\nin West Virginia, it is the number 1 killer in my State. These \\nare drugs out of the medicine cabinet and they are just being \\nabused. That is an important issue for not just me, but for, I \\nthink, every Senator here in every part of America that is \\nplagued by the epidemic of drug abuse and addiction. Of course, \\nyou know the VA patients are no different. We have a lot of our \\nveterans returning and they are getting over-drugged as soon as \\nthey get there. They complain to us and they cannot get the \\nproper treatments or the proper evaluation to get the proper \\ntreatment they need. They are having problems with that.\\n    I guess I would just ask, is this one of your most pressing \\nissues, that you are getting a lot of complaints on this? Do \\nyou see this in your investigation?\\n    Dr. Daigh. I would say that the management of patients who \\nrequire or take narcotics in excess of what seems reasonable is \\nprobably one of the most important issues the VA struggles with \\nright now. They are not the Lone Ranger. I think the country \\nstruggles with that problem.\\n    Senator Manchin. If we had a piece of legislation that said \\nyou had to use an alternative before you could prescribe \\nopiates----\\n    Dr. Daigh. I think about things in this way, sir. I think \\nthere are people who have pain. You have a toothache. You need \\ntreatment.\\n    Senator Manchin. Sure.\\n    Dr. Daigh. I think, though, that we need to come up with a \\nway to prevent that patient who starts taking narcotic for a \\ngood reason but then ends up abusing it for some reason. I \\nthink that for the population----\\n    Senator Manchin. We know they are very addictive and people \\nare getting hooked overnight. It seems like we are giving \\noxycontin for anything. You have got a headache, take an \\noxycontin.\\n    Dr. Daigh. I agree entirely with what you are saying. I \\nthink that there are several ways to get there. One way to \\nthink about it is to try to make sure that more people do not \\nbecome addicted to a narcotic and focus your effort on trying \\nto keep that from happening through the many things that I know \\nyou said before that are----\\n    Senator Manchin. I would like to get with you on this \\nissue.\\n    Dr. Daigh. Yes, sir.\\n    Senator Manchin. Mr. Chairman, if I may indulge, just one \\nsecond, if I could. Could you all, any of you want to just \\nanswer very quickly, do you believe that we can give veterans \\nbetter care through the private providers than what we are \\ngiving now through the VA, or just as good, if not better?\\n    Dr. Daigh. My personal view is it depends on what the \\nsituation is. For example----\\n    Senator Manchin. I am just saying, we know all the problems \\nwe are having. No, no. I am just saying within the VA system. \\nThe culture, whether it is procurement, whether it is building \\na hospital, whether it is doing whatever, do you not think the \\ntaxpayers\\' dollars would be spent better if we got our veterans \\nchanneled for thequickest amount ofcare and thebest \\ncare,whereverthat may be?\\n    Dr. Daigh. Yes.\\n    Senator Manchin. Thank you.\\n    Dr. Daigh. My answer is yes, and I think sometimes that \\nwill be the VA.\\n    Senator Manchin. Thank you.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Thanks, Senator Manchin.\\n    Senator Tillis.\\n\\n       HON. THOM TILLIS, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA\\n\\n    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to \\nthank all the panelists for being here.\\n    I have to give a shout out for one of my VAs again. I was \\ndown at the VA on Saturday back in Salisbury, and once again, \\nthey were doing great stuff, a lot of them on their personal \\ntime hosting an event for a Purple Heart recipient. We left \\nthere and went over to the town hall, which is a best practice \\nfor providing care to many seniors.\\n    To expand, Dr. Daigh, on your point, there is no doubt that \\nmany of the veterans who need care want care in a VA facility. \\nThe question is, can we provision it properly and can we make \\nsure that it is done in the most efficient and effective way \\npossible?\\n    I am not going to ask you any questions on all the shiny \\nobjects, reported by the GAO. I am glad to know that the VA has \\nhit a list that really raises attention and, hopefully, \\nmarshaling of resources to fix problems. I think it is good. It \\nis no different than a 300,000-person national company running \\nin the United States where all of the sudden the bond raters or \\nthe stock investors put you on a watch list and get ready to \\ntell people to sell your stock short because you are a failing \\nentity. That is the reality. We have a lot of problems with the \\nVA.\\n    We should not lose sight of the fact that most of the \\nsolutions to the VA are good things that are going on in the \\nVA, and a part of what we have to do on this Committee is \\nrecognize we are sort of a board of directors and we need to \\nperform our fiduciary responsibility to the veterans who need \\nthe care by making sure that we do not become a disabler, which \\nwe could potentially do, by not really focusing on how do we \\nget to a systematic process that identifies the high priority \\nitems, the short-term, as Dr. Clancy said, the short-term \\nthings you can fix because they are relatively straightforward \\nand relatively low cost and high impact.\\n    Then, the intermediate and long-term initiatives that we \\nhave to get implemented. We need an enterprise transformation \\nstrategy for the VA, which Secretary McDonald and I spoke about \\nand I am thrilled to know, although I hope they have not fully \\nread the GAO report--Dr. Shulkin and Laverne Council--because \\nif they did, they may be scared to death and not want to be \\nconfirmed. I am looking forward to the confirmation hearing. \\nThey are very talented people who, I think, if they come in, \\nthey can be a part of the solution.\\n    We have to step back, and instead of having these \\nhearings--and I know that it takes a lot of time for you all to \\nprepare for this, and I know it takes your eye off the ball of \\nthe things that you want to do in your enterprise. What we need \\nto do is get to a point where we have a hearing where we are \\ntalking about an inventory of the problems.\\n    I had a lengthy discussion with Laverne Council on IT \\nissues. There is gold on the floor for improving the IT shop in \\nthe VA, for improving performance, and freeing up resources for \\nother things to do in the VA. We have to get that done. It is \\nnot hard. It gets done every day in the private sector though \\nseldom in the U.S. Government.\\n    We have to get away from this mentality that variation--\\nvariation is oftentimes rationalized and almost never \\njustified. There is a standard best practice and process for IT \\nand provisioning of care. I am not talking about the care \\nprovided to patients. There may need to be some variations at \\nthat atomic level. All these other things, anybody who is in \\nthe VA who is responsible for it should not have a job. They \\nshould know that that was an irresponsible management decision. \\nThey should have had programs in place or recommended to their \\ntop management programs that make sense, which they have not \\ndone.\\n    I believe you all are part of the solution, and I think the \\nGAO and other people that are looking at this are a very \\nimportant part of the solution. But, we have to get to a point \\nto where the Secretary and the senior executives develop a \\nplan, so instead of us coming and chasing the shiny objects and \\nthen having people run down and report on progress of that \\nshiny object, potentially at the expense of more important, \\nhigher-priority things, we have to start looking at this on a \\nholistic basis and then decompose it into very specific action \\nthreats where we can actually start producing results.\\n    One thing I would urge the Secretary to consider is a \\ndifferent way of going about these programs. I think that some \\nof the Members on this Committee, with the Chairman\\'s \\nindulgence, need to be embedded in that enterprise planning \\nstrategy. We need to have people here who are not just coming \\nhere because it is interesting. On the one hand, we are boards \\nof director members, and then on the other hand, we are the \\ngeneral managers of our little VA plants in each of our States. \\nWe hear things that are going on in the State, so all of the \\nsudden, we are hammering you on the specific things in our \\nState. That is not a sustainable approach to addressing these \\nenterprise problems.\\n    We need to get to a point where we are talking about the \\nstrategy and less about all of these examples that need to be \\nfixed; and if they do get fixed, that may satisfy us for this \\nCommittee meeting, but they are not going to satisfy us for the \\nlong term and do what we need to do for the veterans.\\n    That was probably more of a speech than questions, but, Mr. \\nChairman, the only thing I would really ask the Secretary to \\nconsider, and some of these nominees that are coming in is, let \\nus sit down and come up with a different approach, something \\nthat really has not been done on an enterprise basis, and in my \\nestimation, in any area of government. Prioritize this, set \\nspecific--and capital improvement is another one. We talked \\nabout Denver.\\n    Let us talk about this enterprise and let us look at each \\none of these enterprises, put them on a heat map, find out \\nwhich ones we should be tackling and how we prioritize the \\nothers ones, so what we are doing in future Committee meetings \\nis talking about time to benefit and whether or not you made \\nyour goals, and hold people accountable--reward them for having \\nachieved success and hold them accountable for having failed \\nto.\\n    I think, if we do that, we will get away from this \\ndiscussion that has been going on for years without substantial \\nimprovement and get to a truly transformed organization that \\nwill include VA facilities, hard working people in \\nFayetteville, Durham, Salisbury, Asheville, and all over this \\ncountry, will include the best practices that are already \\nembedded at a lot of those facilities.\\n    I am sorry I went over.\\n    Chairman Isakson. We will go to Senator Tester in just a \\nsecond. I want to make two comments.\\n    First of all, I appreciate calling our attention to the \\nconfirmations. For the record, Dr. Clancy, those confirmations \\nwill be on May 5. The reason they were not last week is because \\nwe did not have the answers to all the questions that had been \\nsubmitted and we cannot do a final markup until we do, so I \\nappreciate your attention to that.\\n    Second, Sen. Tillis, I thought it was one of your better \\nspeeches. [Laughter.]\\n    I always do this. I may forward good ideas, but Dr. Clancy, \\ndo you have someone in the veterans health services that is the \\noperational point person for responses to things like GAO and \\nIG reports?\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes, we do.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Who is that person?\\n    Dr. Clancy. A physician named Dr. Karen Rasmussen. She is \\nhere with me today.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Where is Karen Rasmussen? Hi, Dr. \\nRasmussen. How are you? I want to volunteer Senator Tillis and \\nyou to do a little project for me, if you would. I thought what \\nyou just said was an outstanding template to begin to get a \\ngame plan for responding and dealing with the recommendations \\nof the IG and the Department. If you would work with Karen to \\nsee if there is a way that your idea can mesh with what they \\nare doing in the VA, because I have got a feeling the VA does \\nthings the way they think they are supposed to do them because \\nthat is the way it has always been done. What you talked about \\nis a different way of doing things, and maybe there is a \\ncombination between those two that would serve well. I do not \\nwant to force you to honor your speeches, but if you would be \\nwilling to do that and Karen would be willing, I think.\\n    Senator Tillis. Mr. Chair, I would ask, with your \\nindulgence, that you consider maybe having a Member from the \\nother side join in, because I honestly would like for this to \\nbecome a point where people on this body have confidence in \\nyour overarching enterprise transformation strategy so we \\nremove ourselves from chasing the latest issue of the day, \\nwhich is important, but we become advocates for building \\ncredibility around a strategy that has specific timeline goals \\nand measurable results. I think it would be worthwhile to have \\na couple of us take a look at that and I would be honored to \\nhelp.\\n    Chairman Isakson. I am going to ask Ranking Member \\nBlumenthal if he will supply us with a volunteer and let us \\nknow who that volunteer is. It does not have to be right this \\nminute, because I pulled this totally off the top of my head, \\nbut----\\n    Senator Blumenthal. We will definitely provide you with a \\nvolunteer.\\n    Chairman Isakson. I want to thank Senator Tillis in advance \\nfor doing so and thank Dr. Rasmussen for being willing to take \\non that task, too. Thank you very much.\\n    Senator Tester, I apologize for taking some of your time. I \\napologize for interrupting.\\n\\n           HON. JON TESTER, U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA\\n\\n    Senator Tester. No problem, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very \\nmuch; and not for the record, I think that is the best speech \\nyou ever gave, Senator Sullivan. The best. [Laughter.]\\n    Senator Tillis. I will tell Senator Sullivan you said that. \\n[Laughter.]\\n    Senator Tester. We had a recent hearing in front of the VA \\nAppropriations Mil Con, VA Appropriations Subcommittee, and I \\nbelieve, if I heard it correctly, the Secretary said that he \\nrequested that the VA be put on the High-Risk List. I may be \\nwrong on that, but I thought that was the case.\\n    Dr. Clancy. He did say that, yes.\\n    Senator Tester. In the midst of all this, we had $1.4 \\nbillion cut out of the House VA appropriations bill, which I \\nknow we will deal with it in our own way over here that would \\nresult in less veterans getting care, more specifically, about \\n$690 million cut to medical care means 70,000 fewer veterans \\nwould receive the health care they need. Veto threats have been \\nmade. The National Commander said the VA cannot fulfill its \\nmission without proper funding, but the House, for whatever \\nreason, now wants to ration care, eliminate infrastructure \\nprojects, stop improving upon the programs and services the VA \\nwas created to provide.\\n    Dr. Clancy, is it fair to say that if the Senate took up \\nthe VA funding bill as it has now been voted out of \\nsubcommittee that it would be very difficult to get removed \\nfrom the High-Risk List?\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes, I think that is fair to say. It would \\ncertainly slow our progress. The Secretary has been strongly \\ncommitted to being as open and transparent with all of you in \\nterms of what are our requirements to meet veterans\\' needs and \\nthat is actually what we submitted in the administration\\'s \\nrequest. I will leave it at that.\\n    Senator Tester. Thank you. I think the facts are that we \\nhave got Iraq and Afghanistan going on, but the Vietnam \\nveterans are the ones who need the attention right now, and \\nrightfully so, and we thank them for their service, too. Part \\nof that thank you is making sure they get the health care they \\nneed when they need that health care.\\n    I want to talk about some of those facilities. It is \\nabsolutely clear that we need to bolster our medical workforce. \\nIt is just not debatable. But, with that comes an increase in \\nfacilities and space to accommodate that. It is kind of the \\nchicken and the egg kind of a thing. It has to happen almost \\nsimultaneously or you are not going to get the bang for the \\nbuck nor the services you expect.\\n    When I took the Secretary to Missoula, Montana here last \\nmonth, he saw some of that local demand. We saw a clinic that \\nhas exceeded its capacity. The veterans in that region are \\ngrowing 24 percent just in the next 6 months. He had said that \\nthere would be a green light to expand that facility. I do not \\nknow if you know or not. Is that true?\\n    Dr. Clancy. I would have to check on that and get back with \\nyou.\\n    Senator Tester. OK. Well----\\n    Dr. Clancy. I think you had also talked about potential \\npartnerships with the--I just forgot the name----\\n    Senator Tester. We talked about partnerships with the \\nBillings clinic----\\n    Dr. Clancy. Thank you. Yes----\\n    Senator Tester [continuing]. For mental health care \\nprofessionals, too----\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes. Yes.\\n    Senator Tester [continuing]. That is also very, very \\nimportant. But, what----\\n    Dr. Clancy. I know Dr. Walter [phonetic] would be happy to \\npursue that.\\n    Senator Tester. Here is what I would point out to you. We \\nare going to expand a facility that is probably going to have \\nto be replaced in a year or two----\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes.\\n    Senator Tester [continuing]. I understand you have got to \\nwalk before you can run, but the truth is that I appreciate the \\nexpansion, but ultimately, they are going to have a new \\nbuilding, and, boy, the quicker we could do that, we could \\nmaybe do away with some of the other expenditures, if you know \\nwhat I mean.\\n    Dr. Clancy. We will get back to you on that.\\n    Senator Tester. All right. Thank you.\\n    The Chairman talked about VA leadership, which is \\ncritically important. I want to talk about that partnership \\nwith the Billings clinic for psychiatry at the University of \\nWashington. Are you guys in the process of formalizing that \\npartnership? Has any more been done than just talk?\\n    Dr. Clancy. Not yet, but Dr. Walter is on my list. I have \\nworked with him in a number of national medical organizations \\nand would be happy to follow up with him.\\n    Senator Tester. He is very, very good, but even more \\nimportantly--and I do not think there is a Senator that sits \\naround this table or maybe even serves in the U.S. Senate that \\nwill not tell you that we need more mental health care \\nprofessionals----\\n    Dr. Clancy. Right.\\n    Senator Tester. Whether you are in New York State, in the \\nbusiest part of New York City, or whether you are in Saco, MT, \\nwe need them. Quite frankly, I think this is an opportunity to \\naddress the rural aspect.\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes.\\n    Senator Tester. If you can follow up on that, that would be \\ngood. I will tell you that I am sure that folks on this \\nCommittee, myself included, will do what we can do to help you \\nmeet mental health care needs out there, that also the whole \\ncountry is short of.\\n    Dr. Clancy. Right. I should just note our appreciation for \\nthe resources in the Choice Act and also in the Clay Hunt Act \\nfor attracting and helping with debt reduction and so forth. I \\nthink that we also need to move upstream to encourage more \\nstudents to go into these fields and that that is clearly going \\nto be the next frontier for us.\\n    Senator Tester. I appreciate the Senator\\'s proactivity on \\ntrying to recruit early.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Thank you, Senator Tester.\\n    Senator Rounds, followed by Senator Boozman.\\n    Senator Rounds.\\n\\n        HON. MIKE ROUNDS, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA\\n\\n    Senator Rounds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Earlier today, Chairman Isakson and I sent a letter to the \\nSecretary of the VA with concerns on reimbursement changes to \\nhome health care and hospice care providers. I have also heard \\nfrom a number of other groups on untimely payments from the VA. \\nLate payments hurt veterans because providers are reluctant to \\ntake on VA patients if they do not get paid in a timely basis. \\nHow does the VA plan to address this particular issue? Are you \\naware of the issue? Possibility that maybe flexibility within \\nyour budgeting process could help provide for some more timely \\npayments, and has the GAO made more than one mention or just \\nthe one mention in 2014 in terms of any recommendations on this \\nparticular issue?\\n    Dr. Clancy. I am acutely aware of this issue. I get a lot \\nof e-mails and correspondence, as does the Secretary. And, I \\nwould guess that we have never been the swiftest payer. I think \\nthat is putting a lot of providers in a bind right now because \\nthey are feeling a lot of pressure from both the Federal \\nGovernment as well as private payers trying to get to value-\\nbased payments and so forth. They have less flexibility and \\nthey are now feeling like they are really in a box.\\n    Because of the consolidation of our central business office \\nand our payments, our biggest challenge right now is making \\nsure that we get the business processes right. We are in the \\nmidst of doing that. A number of our networks have shown some \\nimprovements. VISN 23, which your State is part of, is one of \\nour better networks, which is not to say flawless, in terms of \\npayments. Others are further behind.\\n    We are keeping, literally, a weekly eye on this and will \\nnot rest until more providers are getting paid in a timely \\nfashion, because you are completely right. Some veterans say \\nthey go to providers on the outside and are told, I will see \\nyou this time, but next time, Ido not know.That is very,very \\nhigh onour list of priorities right now.\\n    Senator Rounds. I think maybe that goes back, as the \\nChairman had suggested, back to what Senator Tillis had \\nproposed here in terms of the operations side of things.\\n    I am just curious. It looks to me like in a lot of cases we \\nfind some very good people that are working within a system \\nwhich, for lack of a better term, is simply archaic. It is a \\nvery large organization, and what I am curious about is if we \\ntalked about an organizational chart, one in which ideas can \\nflow up and down and direction and focus moves in both \\ndirections, do you have an accurate organizational chart that \\nis available to you that you have had a chance to look through \\nto see where it gets from you down to a doctor, let us say, at \\nthe VA in Sioux Falls, South Dakota?\\n    Dr. Clancy. I think you have just articulated one of our \\nbiggest challenges, for sure. I have organizational charts. I \\nthink our bigger challenge is less the boxes on the chart--\\nalthough we are taking a very hard look at that and will look \\nforward to doing more of that with Dr. Shulkin and so forth--\\nbut it is more what I would say is the physiology. How do the \\nprocesses work?\\n    I know that there is phenomenal work going on at a lot of \\nour local VAs. Salisbury would be one. They are everywhere. We \\ndo not actually get to learn enough from them, and I do not \\nthink that we have created the space in the past where if a \\npolicy is issued from headquarters and people do not have the \\nresources or capacity to do it that they have got the space to \\nsay: great idea, except it will not work here. That is the \\nalignment that we are working very, very hard on now, which, \\nfrankly, is why the recommendations in the High-Risk Report are \\nuseful to us, because they very clearly articulate root causes \\nthat we can use as sort of a compass moving forward.\\n    Senator Rounds. One of the employees in the Sioux Falls \\nlocation tried to chart it, and as near as they could \\ndetermine, from a physician trying to get to the top would have \\n13 layers to literally work their way through. It seems to me \\nthat that may be part of the challenge that you face. You can \\nhave a lot of very hard working individuals, but they are \\nworking in a system which today you would not find in most \\nbusiness proposals. Is that a fair statement?\\n    Dr. Clancy. That is a very fair statement, and I will say, \\nliterally, from day one, when Secretary McDonald was confirmed, \\nyou know, I think it took him probably a few weeks to put his \\npersonal cell phone online and on CNN and so forth, and has \\nmodeled for all of us trying to break up that kind of \\nhierarchial filtering, if you will, of information, both up and \\ndown the chain. I communicate with the field every week. I get \\na lot of e-mails back, which is symbolically important. It is \\nnot the same thing as having clearer processes for it, which is \\nwhat we are working on now.\\n    Senator Rounds. Mr. Chairman, there is just one thought, \\nand that is this. I think when the Chairman and the Ranking \\nMember both indicated at the very first meeting that while we \\nare going to ask some really tough questions, our goal is to \\nsee that you succeed.\\n    Dr. Clancy. I appreciate that immensely. Thank you.\\n    Senator Rounds. We still feel that way and we want to see \\nit happen. But, based on what we saw just in Denver and the \\nchallenges you have got there----\\n    Dr. Clancy. Huge.\\n    Senator Rounds [continuing]. The issues are very \\nsignificant, and perhaps part of what we need to do, as some of \\nyou who have walked into some pretty deep water with lots of \\ngators, maybe it is time that we not only start draining the \\nswamp, but maybe we pull a few of those gators out and move \\nthem in a different direction, as well. Thank you.\\n    Dr. Clancy. Thank you.\\n    Senator Rounds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Thank you, Senator Rounds. Good analogy, \\nby the way.\\n    Senator Boozman.\\n\\n         HON. JOHN BOOZMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS\\n\\n    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all \\nso much for being here. We are glad that things are going \\nbetter in Little Rock.\\n    Dr. Clancy. I will never make that mistake again.\\n    Senator Boozman. I bet. [Laughter.]\\n    Dr. Clancy. I am going to send Senator Sullivan a note, \\nbut----\\n    Senator Boozman. No----\\n    Dr. Clancy [continuing]. But things are better in Little \\nRock.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. You have helped to lighten our meeting \\nsignificantly. Thank you for----\\n    [Laughter.]\\n    Senator Boozman. Thank you very much. In the GAO report, \\none of the reasons that VHA ended up on the High-Risk List is \\nbecause of ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes, which \\nis interesting. I think all of us feel like we need to bring to \\nall of you the things that we are hearing out in the field; and \\none of the complaints that I hear most often is that VA has no \\nstandardized processes for reimbursing claims. You are kind of \\nhearing the same thing over and over.\\n    It is really difficult if you are in an area where you are \\nacross borders and across VISNs or however we designate things \\nnow, but you will have one method of handling things in \\nMemphis. You will have another in Jackson, MS. You will have \\nanother in Little Rock. It really does get confusing. So, that \\nis something I think we really need to look at and I would \\nappreciate it if you would look at standardizing those kind of \\nthings.\\n    Again, these are things that do not cost money. These are \\nthings that will save you time and save the practitioners.\\n    The other problem is that, I think, practitioners get hung \\nup. I am sure it is true in the VA, with VA practitioners, like \\nif you are on the phone for 2 hours trying to figure out what \\nis going on, trying to figure out where a claim is at. Is there \\na way to, perhaps using some sort of identification, taxpayer \\nnumber or whatever, to do that electronically, where you could \\nget in a situation where you could go online and figure out \\nwhere you are at as far as----\\n    Dr. Clancy. First, we are trying----\\n    Senator Boozman [continuing]. Medical claims?\\n    Dr. Clancy [continuing]. We are working very hard now to \\nstandardize these processes, and I think you are all aware that \\nwe have about five different paths to helping veterans get care \\nin the community, which is a little bit part of the problem. It \\nis not the sole problem. Some of the original problem is not \\nhaving standard processes at every facility.\\n    It is further complicated by the fact that we have got the \\nresources offered by Choice, which is terrific, the PC3 \\ncontract, Project ARCH in some areas, traditional non-VA care, \\nand some other agreements with our affiliates and so forth. It \\nis a pretty messy puzzle, not a script you would write from \\nscratch.\\n    I think that we are going to look forward to working with \\nall of you to look for opportunities to streamline that, \\nbecause in the end, if you have got five different ways to do \\nsomething built into the process before you even start getting \\nwith claims, you are more likely to increase the probability of \\nerror. It is almost a law.\\n    We are working very hard on standardizing how we pay those \\nclaims right now. That is not going to be fixed immediately, \\nbut I have got some of our very best people on this, and as I \\nnoted earlier, we have our senior leaders in D.C. this week. We \\nwere working about this into the evening last night. It is a \\nhuge challenge with us.\\n    We embrace the opportunities to do the best by veterans \\nwhen we see them in our system, but also to take advantage of \\nlocal capabilities. We need to have business processes that \\nsupport it and that is not what we have had. So, I will leave \\nit at that.\\n    Senator Boozman. No, and I appreciate that, and it is \\ndifficult. Another thing that we hear is that, and I think \\nSenator Rounds mentioned it in the sense of you have policies, \\nyou have directives, and sometimes you have situations where \\nperhaps employees feel like that that is not appropriate there \\nand kind of go around. And, the other side of that is we want \\npeople to have local control, which I understand is really \\ndifficult.\\n    With whistleblowers we have a situation now that reports of \\nretaliation and things like that. Can you all address that and \\ntalk to us a little bit about what is going on in that regard. \\nCertainly, you want people to come forward without the problem \\nof retaliation.\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes. I will say that the Secretary has been \\nincredibly crystal clear from day one, and Sloan Gibson before \\nhim, when he was Acting Secretary, that retaliation will not be \\ntolerated.\\n    I will go further and say there is no health care \\norganization in this country or anywhere in the world that can \\nactually provide safe care without whistleblowers. Now, I am \\nusing a small ``w\\'\\' here, OK. But, if people are not coming \\nforward and saying, we have a problem, I am seeing a problem, \\nthere is a leak over here. In fact, if people are not actively \\nlooking for error all the time, you will never get to care that \\nis reliable and safe.\\n    Nuclear industries run like this, right. They are \\nconstantly looking for, where are we going to have a problem \\nand anticipating them ahead of time. That is where we have got \\nto get to.\\n    In that context, whistleblowers are heroes, which is why \\nsome of our executives have actually gone to ceremonies \\ncelebrating them and so forth.\\n    I think we are not retaliating and we are cooperating fully \\nwith investigations of those who have been accused of \\nretaliating. I know that Senator Blumenthal had a lot of \\nquestions about this. Some of these investigations are still \\nongoing. But, appropriate discipline can be taken, I can assure \\nyou.\\n    Senator Boozman. Can I, with your permission, just to \\nfollow up with that.\\n    Dr. Clancy. Sure.\\n    Senator Boozman. In the bill that we passed, we gave you \\nthe ability to retaliate against people that were not acting \\nappropriately, in the sense of giving you the ability to get \\nrid of people that were not working out. Do we need to--that \\nwas at the top. I know Senator Rubio and Congressman Miller \\nhave introduced bills to make it such that a lower level, that \\nyou have more flexibility in that regard, again, those people \\nthat are not working out. Do you support that, so that we can \\ndeal with some of the problems like retaliation?\\n    Dr. Clancy. We have discussed this with the Secretary and \\nso forth. We are very uncomfortable with anything that would \\nsingle out VA as opposed to other Federal departments because \\nit might impair our ability to recruit.\\n    I think that we welcome the flexibility that you gave us \\nwhen you passed the Choice Act because it does not eliminate \\ndue process but encourages to speed up the process. Due process \\ndoes take some time. Again, that balance between if people feel \\nlike if they wave their hands and raise their hands, excuse me, \\nand say, we have got a problem, that they do not need to fear \\nbeing punished. That is the balance that we are--it is very \\ndynamic and that is what we are struggling for.\\n    So, I know that some people who work in VHA do not feel \\nthat safe right now at the senior leader level. I am not sure \\nthat making that more widely available would necessarily be \\nhelpful.\\n    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Thank you, Senator Boozman.\\n    Senator Blumenthal had a follow-up question.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. You just mentioned, Dr. Clancy, that \\nthere will be disciplinary measures. When will there be----\\n    Dr. Clancy. We are waiting for the results of \\ninvestigations to conclude. I know, for example, in Phoenix \\nthat there are multiple investigations going on right now. By \\ndesign, many of these are being done by the Office of \\nthe Inspector General. We are waiting to hear from them. I \\ncannot give you a specific timeline except to say that when we \\nget those results, we will act as swiftly as we can.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Dr. Daigh, when will the investigations \\nbe done?\\n    Dr. Daigh. I think the best answer I can give you, sir, is \\nthat there is a process in place to work through AUSAs and to \\nmove forward according to the rules that we normally deal with \\nfor criminal complaint.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. By AUSAs, you mean----\\n    Dr. Daigh. Assistant U.S.----\\n    Senator Blumenthal [continuing]. Assistant U.S. Attorneys.\\n    Dr. Daigh. That is correct, sir. But, I----\\n    Senator Blumenthal. But, they do not prepare reports.\\n    Dr. Daigh. I believe that we take our reports to them to \\nseek whether or not they will attempt to prosecute an \\nindividual.\\n    I think it best that the investigators get back to you in a \\nwritten response.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Have those reports been submitted to \\nthe AUSAs?\\n    Dr. Daigh. I cannot speak to all of them, but I know that \\nsome have. I am aware that some have, yes.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Well, let me again ask you what the \\ntimeline is for their consideration. How long have those \\ninvestigations been ongoing?\\n    Dr. Daigh. Sir, I will have to get back with you for the \\nrecord. I simply do not work in that area non-stop. I will say \\nthat at every staff meeting we have within the Inspector \\nGeneral\\'s office, we get an update on numbers of how many \\nreports are where, and I know that there are a number of them \\nwith AUSAs.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. I really do appreciate your offer to \\nprovide me with information, but, quite bluntly, the American \\npeople deserve this information, not just Members of Congress \\nin a private briefing setting or in a written response. The \\nAmerican people deserve to know who will be held accountable, \\nwhy the investigations have not been completed, what is going \\nto be done to expedite them. Justice needs to be sure, swift \\nand sure, especially when it comes to danger of people\\'s lives. \\nBoth you and Dr. Draper have indicated that lives were at risk \\nand maybe even lost as a result of potential wrongdoing in \\nPhoenix and in 1992 or 1993, other situations around the United \\nStates.\\n    So far, we have been discussing only Phoenix, and the \\nreports, investigations there are not even complete yet. Am I \\ncorrect?\\n    Dr. Daigh. I am uncertain exactly about the \\ninvestigations----\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Dr. Clancy is nodding her head, which, \\nI think, is----\\n    Dr. Daigh. I believe her, but I am not certain on that \\nfact. But, sir, I believe that all of us want this to be done \\nas far as we can. There is no----\\n    Senator Blumenthal. I am sure you do want it to be done as \\nquickly as possible. We all want it to be done as quickly as \\npossible. The question is when it will be done.\\n    Let me just ask one last question. There have been various \\nproposals to take a billion dollars from money that was \\nallocated to the accessibility and Choice program in order to \\npay for completion of the Denver medical facility. My belief is \\nthat taking this billion dollars from the Choice program would \\nmake it far more difficult and unlikely for the VA to be \\nremoved from the High-Risk List. Does anybody disagree?\\n    Let me interrupt myself to call on Dr. Daigh.\\n    Dr. Daigh. Sir, the only thing I can say is I am not sure \\nthat we have studied that question, so I----\\n    Senator Blumenthal. You are not disagreeing, then.\\n    Dr. Daigh. I am not disagreeing.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Does anyone disagree? Dr. Draper.\\n    Ms. Draper. Well, I will say we have specific criteria for \\nremoval from the High-Risk List; and we do have, in response to \\nSenator Tillis, I think, a good framework for how agencies \\naddress getting off the High-Risk List.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Well, let me put the question a \\ndifferent way. Detracting from the objectives of the Choice \\nprogram by diverting a billion dollars will make it far more \\ndifficult and unlikely that the VA will meet those criteria, is \\nthat correct? Dr. Clancy.\\n    Dr. Clancy. If I could just provide some specific details. \\nThe Choice resources are sort of two big buckets, right. One is \\nthe $10 billion for the actual purchasing care in the community \\nand the other is $5 billion really focused on enhancing our \\ncapacity.\\n    Most of our facilities, when asked about their acute needs, \\nactually front-loaded their requests from that $5 billion for \\nconstruction. Most were not for new facilities, but mostly for \\nnon-recurring maintenance, renovation, and so forth, which goes \\non all the time in the hospital and health care industry, \\nright. The proposal is that a portion of that would be slowed \\ndown. It would not inherently affect our capacity in terms of \\nincreasing space and hiring people who need to see patients.\\n    I take your point, but I want to say that----\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Dr. Clancy----\\n    Dr. Clancy [continuing]. We have a very strong commitment \\nto get off this High-Risk List, but at the same time, I think \\nDenver, the facility there, and what is the right thing to do \\nfor veterans and the public is also pretty imperative.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Would it not affect the quality of \\ncare?\\n    Dr. Clancy. In most instances, slowing down the \\nconstruction, renovation, and so forth would not necessarily \\nimpact the quality of care.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Not necessarily, but I can tell you in \\nthe instances where I know and I have talked to my colleagues--\\n--\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes.\\n    Senator Blumenthal [continuing]. It would have an impact on \\nquality of care. We are talking about in the Westhaven facility \\nin New Haven----\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes. Mm-hmm.\\n    Senator Blumenthal [continuing]. Primary care.\\n    Dr. Clancy. Yes.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. I would like to know from you, and you \\ndo not have to do it now----\\n    Dr. Clancy. OK.\\n    Senator Blumenthal [continuing]. You can provide it in \\nwritten form----\\n    Dr. Clancy. I will give you an informed, thoughtful \\nresponse.\\n    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you.\\n    I want to thank all the witnesses for your very informative \\nand helpful comments today.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Isakson. Thank you, Ranking Member Blumenthal.\\n    I would just end by saying this, that I think within these \\nrecommendations and findings of GAO and the Inspector General, \\nthere are savings and there are funds that could be used to pay \\nfor things that the VA needs to pay for without us just adding \\nonto the burden. I think Senator Blumenthal makes an \\noutstanding point, and I told Sloan Gibson in Denver that when \\nthe recommendation comes to the Committee as to how we pay for \\nthe billion-dollar overrun, if there is not contribution from \\nwithin the operational budget of the VA itself, I do not know \\nhow we are ever going to get any money done to do it \\nwhatsoever. I hope as they look to build that, they will find \\nthose funds internally to the extent possible without damaging \\nthe VA.\\n    With that said, I want to thank all our people for \\ntestifying. Thank you for being here, and I thank Senator \\nTillis for volunteering to be my Committee Chairman, and Karen, \\nthank you for being so willing to be voluntarily volunteered \\nfor a task.\\n    This meeting stands adjourned.\\n    [Whereupon, at 3:58 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]\\n Response to Posthearing Questions Submitted by Hon. Johnny Isakson to \\nDebra A. Draper, Director, Health Care, U.S. Government Accountability \\n                                 Office\\n    Question 1.  A number of factors are considered in evaluating \\nwhether any Federal department, agency, or program should be placed on \\nthe High Risk List. Please describe the procedures, process, and people \\ninvolved in the Government Accountability Office to determine whether a \\nFederal program is placed on the List.\\n    Response. Many individuals within GAO with expertise in various \\nFederal policy areas, including the Comptroller General, are involved \\nin the process of evaluating whether specific programs or functions \\nshould be included on the High Risk List. Affected agencies and \\ndepartments are not solicited for their agreement to be placed on the \\nlist, nor do they ask to be placed on the list. Rather, the decision to \\nadd areas to the High Risk List is a determination made solely by GAO \\nbased on comprehensive analyses and quality assurance reviews.\\n    To determine which Federal Government programs and functions should \\nbe included on the High Risk list, we use our guidance document, \\nDetermining Performance and Accountability Challenges and High \\nRisks.\\\\1\\\\ In making this determination, we consider:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ GAO, Determining Performance and Accountability Challenges and \\nHigh Risks, GAO-01-159SP (Washington, DC: November 2000).\\n\\n    <bullet> whether the program or function is of national \\nsignificance or is key to performance and accountability;\\n    <bullet> qualitative factors, such as whether the risk involves \\npublic health or safety, service delivery, national security, national \\ndefense, economic growth, or privacy or citizens\\' rights; or, could \\nresult in significantly impaired service, program failure, injury or \\nloss of life, or significantly reduced economy, efficiency, or \\neffectiveness;\\n    <bullet> the exposure to loss in monetary or other quantitative \\nterms--at a minimum, $1 billion must be at risk in areas such as the \\nvalue of major assets being impaired; revenue sources not being \\nrealized; major agency assets being lost, stolen, damaged, wasted, or \\nunderutilized; potential for, or evidence of improper payments; and \\npresence of contingencies or potential liabilities; and,\\n    <bullet> corrective measures planned or under way to resolve a \\nmaterial control weakness and the status and potential effectiveness of \\nthese actions--if effective solutions will not be completed in the near \\nterm and resolve the root causes of the problem, we determine that the \\nprogram or function is high risk.\\n\\n    The process for determining whether VA health care should be \\ndesignated high risk began months before GAO issued its 2015 high risk \\nseries update. In making the determination to add VA health care to the \\nHigh Risk List in 2015, a number of specific factors were considered. \\nIn recent years, we have made numerous recommendations that aim to \\naddress weaknesses in VA\\'s management of its health care system--more \\nthan 100 of which have yet to be fully implemented. After analyzing the \\nfindings of GAO\\'s work on VA health care completed over the past five \\nyears, we categorized our concerns about VA\\'s ability to ensure the \\ntimeliness, cost-effectiveness, quality, and safety of the health care \\nthe department provides into five broad areas: (1) ambiguous policies \\nand inconsistent processes, (2) inadequate oversight and \\naccountability, (3) information technology challenges, (4) inadequate \\ntraining for VA staff, and (5) unclear resource needs and allocation \\npriorities.\\n    Once the determination was made to add VA health care to its High \\nRisk List, GAO briefed the relevant Congressional committees of \\njurisdiction. Just prior to the publication of the 2015 High Risk List, \\nGAO officials met with and informed VA officials--including the VA \\nSecretary and Under Secretary for Health--that VA health care was being \\nadded to the list.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n  Response to Posthearing Questions Submitted by Hon. Dan Sullivan to \\nDebra A. Draper, Director, Health Care, U.S. Government Accountability \\n                                 Office\\n    Question 1.  Dr. Draper, the VA and the VHA are getting beaten up a \\nlot in the media and in Congress. While a lot of aggressive oversight \\nis justified, a group of people can only take so much of this type of \\noversight before they become timid and simply check the box to not get \\nin trouble. This is not the type of culture we want at the VA. What \\nsuggestions do you have to improve the culture at the VHA and the VA as \\na whole?\\n\\n    Question 2.  Dr. Draper, what suggestions do you have to actually \\nencourage innovation and new ideas?\\n\\n    Question 4.  Dr. Draper, how can we create excellence at the VA?\\n    Response. We provide a combined response to questions 1, 2 and 4, \\nas all three questions deal with VA organization, performance, and \\nopportunities for improvement.\\n    VHA\\'s mission states, ``Honor America\\'s veterans by providing \\nexceptional health care that improves their health and well-being.\\'\\' \\nHowever, risks to the timeliness, cost- effectiveness, quality, and \\nsafety of veterans\\' health care, along with other persistent weaknesses \\nidentified by GAO, VA\\'s Office of the Inspector General, and others in \\nrecent years have not only raised concerns about VA\\'s management and \\noversight of its health care system, but also increased awareness of \\nthe magnitude and pervasiveness of the issues. Over the past few years \\nthere have been numerous reports of VAMCs failing to provide timely \\ncare, including specialty care, and in some cases, the delays have \\nreportedly resulted in harm to veterans.\\\\2\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\2\\\\ See, for example, Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of \\nInspector General, Healthcare Inspection Gastroenterology Consult \\nDelays William Jennings Bryan Dorn VA Medical Center Columbia, South \\nCarolina, Report No. 12-04631-313. (Washington D.C.: September 6, \\n2013), and Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, \\nHealthcare Inspection Consultation Mismanagement and Care Delays \\nSpokane VA Medical Center Spokane, Washington, Report No. 12-01731-284. \\n(Washington D.C.: September 25, 2012).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    In addition to its responsibility to those veterans it serves, VA \\nalso has a fiduciary responsibility to the American people to ensure \\nthat taxpayer dollars are spent properly. Congress has provided steady \\nincreases in VA\\'s annual health care budget with amounts increasing \\nfrom $23.0 billion to $55.5 billion between fiscal years 2002 and 2013. \\nAdditionally, the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of \\n2014 provides $15 billion in new funding for, among other things, the \\nuse of non-VA clinicians to provide care for those veterans faced with \\naccess challenges, including those related to lengthy travel distances \\nand long wait times.\\n    To address these issues and help improve the department\\'s culture, \\nencourage innovation, and create excellence, I suggest VA consider the \\nfollowing resources. First, GAO\\'s five criteria for removal from the \\nHigh Risk List provide an excellent framework for performance \\nimprovement, while also addressing the relevant high-risk issues for \\nVA. The following are the five criteria for removal:\\n\\n    <bullet> Leadership commitment. Agency leadership has demonstrated \\nstrong commitment and support.\\n    <bullet> Capacity. Agency has the capacity (i.e., people and \\nresources) to resolve the risk(s).\\n    <bullet> Action plan. Agency has developed a corrective action plan \\nthat defines the root cause(s), identifies solutions, and provides for \\nsubstantially completing corrective measures, including steps necessary \\nto implement solutions we recommended.\\n    <bullet> Monitoring. Agency has instituted a program to monitor and \\nindependently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of \\ncorrective measures.\\n    <bullet> Demonstrated progress. Agency has demonstrated progress in \\nimplementing corrective measures and in resolving the high-risk area.\\n\\n    Second, VA could seek to learn from the experiences of other \\nagencies and program areas that have been successfully removed from, or \\nare making progress toward removal from GAO\\'s High Risk List. For \\nexample, the National Academy of Public Administration recently \\nsponsored a discussion on the opportunities and challenges of being on \\nGAO\\'s High Risk List, by a panel of participants representing agencies \\nand programs that have been included on, or have been removed from the \\nlist. At the discussion, one official said the agency she represented \\nused a portfolio management system to prioritize risks for leaders, \\nwhich helped the program to be removed from the High Risk List. Another \\nagency official with programs currently on the High Risk List said his \\noffice was planning to launch an exchange program to gather ideas by \\ngiving employees experiences in other offices.\\n    Third, VA could consult organizational performance literature and \\nresearch, which commonly identify several key characteristics of highly \\neffective, excellent, and innovative organizations. These include the \\nfollowing:\\n\\n    <bullet> Well defined and compelling mission, purpose, and expected \\nresults\\n    <bullet> Clear and visible commitment to excellence\\n    <bullet> Customer/client-centric\\n    <bullet> Efficient and effective infrastructure, systems and \\nprocesses\\n    <bullet> Effective management of resources, including attracting \\nand retaining a highly qualified workforce\\n    <bullet> Empowered workforce, including open, trusting, and multi-\\ndirectional communications\\n    <bullet> Flexible and adaptable in an ever changing environment\\n    <bullet> Emphasis on continuous learning\\n\\n    Finally, a number of programs are available to assist organizations \\nin achieving performance excellence. One such program is the Baldrige \\nPerformance Excellence Program, which is administered by the Department \\nof Commerce\\'s National Institute of Standards and Technology, in \\nconjunction with the private sector. The Baldrige Criteria for \\nPerformance Excellence--used by organizations around the country, \\nincluding health care organizations--provide a framework and tool to \\nassess organizational strengths and weaknesses, to identify \\nopportunities for improvement, and to create a plan for moving \\nforward.\\\\3\\\\ According to the Baldrige Program, ``performance excellence \\nrefers to an integrated approach to organizational performance \\nmanagement that results in: (1) delivery of ever-improving value to \\ncustomers and stakeholders, contributing to organizational \\nsustainability; (2) improvement in overall organizational effectiveness \\nand capabilities; and, (3) organizational and personal learning.\\'\\' In \\naddition to the Baldridge Program, other entities, such as the \\nInstitute for Healthcare Improvement and the Joint Commission, also \\noffer programs that focus on health care organizations\\' performance \\nimprovement.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ See for example, http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/about/\\nperformance--excellence.cfm.\\n\\n    Question 3.  Dr. Draper, what authorities can Congress give you to \\nhelp these innovations and ideas cut through the existing VA and VHA \\nbureaucracies?\\n    Response. GAO has adequate audit authority to continue to provide \\nrobust oversight of VA. To help ensure VA takes the necessary actions \\nto improve health care for the Nation\\'s veterans, congressional \\nattention and oversight is critical. In the spring and summer of 2014, \\ncongressional committees held more than 20 hearings to address \\nidentified weaknesses in the VA health care system. Sustained \\ncongressional attention to these issues will help ensure that VA \\ncontinues to make progress in improving the delivery of health care \\nservices to veterans. This includes continued congressional oversight \\nof VA\\'s progress made on implementing recommendations made by GAO, VA\\'s \\nOffice of the Inspector General, and others. As part of this ongoing \\noversight, it would also be beneficial for Congress, as well as GAO, to \\nreceive periodic updates (e.g., quarterly) from VA on its progress in \\naddressing the five areas of concern that led to its health care system \\nbeing placed on the High Risk List.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\nResponse to Posthearing Questions Submitted by Hon. Richard Blumenthal \\n    to Carolyn M. Clancy, M.D., Interim Under Secretary for Health, \\n  Veterans Health Administration, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\\n    Question 1.  Dr. Clancy, during your testimony we discussed the \\nissue of delayed construction and maintenance projects and their \\npotential negative effects on quality of care. While you stated that \\ndelaying improvement projects would not necessarily have an impact on \\nquality of care, I am concerned that delaying necessary improvement and \\nmaintenance for Veterans Health Administration facilities would have \\nlong-term effects on the level of care that is delivered to veterans, \\nand the ultimate costs to maintain the facility. For instance, the \\nAdministration has recently suggested delaying an improvement project \\nfor the primary care clinic at the West Haven VAMC. I have visited that \\nfacility many times and I am convinced that veterans, and particularly \\nwomen veterans, need a new primary care clinic that meets their health \\ncare needs.\\n\\n    a. Can you please tell me how VA plans to ensure that delays in \\nconstruction and maintenance projects do not negatively affect patient \\ncare?\\n    Response. The West Haven project was submitted and approved through \\nVA\\'s FY 2014 Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) process. This \\nproject was delayed due to scope changes. The design contract for the \\nproject is scheduled to be awarded this month.\\n    VA will ensure that delays in construction and maintenance projects \\ndo not adversely affect patient care by utilizing the many capabilities \\nat our disposal, such as; expanded hours, telehealth, and care in the \\ncommunity. These capabilities will allow us the flexibility we need to \\nensure that Veterans receive the quality and timely care that they \\nrightfully deserve.\\n\\n    b. Are there any specific actions VA will take to alleviate any \\nidentified gaps in care?\\n    Response. VA continually looks for gaps in care by tracking and \\nclosely monitoring facility and network capacity. In response to the \\nrecent crisis of Veteran access, senior leaders from across the \\ndepartment gather daily to focus on improving Veterans\\' access to care, \\nthereby alleviating gaps in care. We have concentrated on key drivers \\nof access, including increasing medical center staffing by 11,000, \\nadding space, boosting care during extended hours and weekends by 10 \\npercent and increasing staff productivity. This focus on capacity \\ncreates organizational opportunities to leverage choice and virtual \\ncare. We currently have ongoing pilots and programs, such as My \\nHealtheVet, to operationalize these plans and create opportunities to \\nidentify potential gaps in a Veterans care.\\n\\n    c. Please tell me what steps VA plans to take to minimize the \\nimpact of delayed minor construction and nonrecurring maintenance on \\nthe condition of its facilities?\\n    Response. If any minor construction or NRM projects that were \\noriginally to be funded through Section 801 of the Choice Act are \\ndelayed, VA will work to restore funds for the delayed project(s) in \\neither fiscal year (FY) 2016 or FY 2017. In an effort to mitigate the \\nimpact to Veterans due to the potentially delayed projects, VA will \\nwork to ensure that access is provided through other avenues within VA \\nand also within the community.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n  Response to Posthearing Questions Submitted by Hon. John Boozman to \\n Stephen W. Warren, Executive in Charge and Chief Information Officer, \\n Office of Information Technology, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\\n    Question 1.  Does the VA currently have an interoperable pharmacy \\ndata transaction system that is interoperable with the Department of \\nDefense?\\n    Response. DOD and VA do have interoperability for pharmacy data and \\ncurrently exchange pharmacy data on Veterans. Both departments store or \\nmap the data to nationally accepted standards. This enables each to \\ninterpret and compute the other\\'s data without risk of ambiguity.\\n    VA does not yet have the capability to send prescriptions to DOD \\nfor dispensing or to receive prescriptions from DOD.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n  Response to Posthearing Questions Submitted by Hon. Dan Sullivan to \\n Carolyn M. Clancy, M.D., Interim Under Secretary for Health, Veterans \\n       Health Administration, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\\n  seriousness of the list and it\\'s not just about getting off the list\\n    Question 1.  How seriously is the VA and VHA taking being on the \\nGAO\\'s High Risk List?\\n    Response. VA takes its inclusion on the GAO High Risk List \\nextremely seriously and recognizes that we have a distinct opportunity \\nto address these challenges across the system. This will require us to \\nseek collaboration opportunities throughout the Department and in the \\ncommunity. We are committed to instituting long term durable solutions \\nand sustained improvement in the high risk areas identified. As we \\nimplement corrective measures, we will provide GAO with documentation \\nof our progress. Additionally, we will seek input from GAO and OIG to \\nensure that our actions are meeting the intent of their \\nrecommendations. We look forward to substantial improvement and \\ncompleting the recommendations which they have identified.\\n\\n    Question 2.  What specifically should the VHA do to not just get \\noff this list, but to make the VHA a healthcare solution that Veterans \\nwant?\\n    Response. VHA has established a Blueprint for Excellence that \\noffers a detailed vision for the evolution of health care services \\nprovided by VHA. The Blueprint provides guidance for the alignment of \\nresources to transform VHA from being provider-centric to Veteran-\\ncentric; with specific strategies that offer a pathway to address GAO\\'s \\nfive high risk areas. Addressing these strategies is a fundamental part \\nof VHA Senior Leaders performance plans. The Blueprint for Excellence \\nwill allow for Health Care that simultaneously address improving the \\nperformance of VHA healthcare, developing a positive service culture, \\ntransitioning from ``sick care\\'\\' to ``health care\\'\\' in the broadest \\nsense, and developing agile business systems and management processes \\nthat are efficient, transparent and accountable.\\n    The Blueprint for Excellence aligns with several of the GAO high \\nrisk areas by emphasizing what VHA must do to become the system that \\nVeterans deserve, and secondarily helping VA get off the GAO High Risk \\nlist:\\n\\n    <bullet> Improving performance,\\n    <bullet> promoting a positive culture of service,\\n    <bullet> Advancing healthcare innovation for Veterans and the \\ncountry, and\\n    <bullet> Increasing operational effectiveness and accountability.\\n\\n    VHA has developed specific actions to get off the High Risk List, \\nusing the Blueprint for Excellence as the vehicle. Regarding national \\npolicy and processes, VHA is integrating our policy and operational \\nleaders across business lines, such as primary care, surgical care and \\nmental health, which will align policy development with implementation. \\nHealth care is a dynamic industry, and our policies must be flexible \\nenough to accommodate evolving standards for clinical care and clinical \\njudgment. We will continue to improve our processes and implementation \\nof policies to address GAO and OIG findings, and ensure VHA provides \\ntimely high quality care to all Veterans.\\n    With respect to oversight and accountability, VHA restructured the \\nOffice of the Medical Inspector (OMI) into an integral element of VHA\\'s \\noversight and compliance program. Responsible for assessing the quality \\nof VA health care through site-specific investigations and system-wide \\nassessments, OMI reports directly to the Under Secretary for Health. \\nOMI\\'s policies and procedures were revised to ensure that health care \\nquality and patient safety remain a primary and constant focus.\\n    Concerning information technology, VA is modernizing our Electronic \\nHealth Record (EHR), VistA, which is the most widely used EHR in the \\nUnited States. VA is also developing a new web based Enterprise Health \\nManagement Platform, or eHMP. We will continue to share health care \\ndata on millions of Servicemembers and Veterans with the Department of \\nDefense and our community partners in compliance with all relevant \\nprivacy laws.\\n    Human capital training is critical to ensure Veterans receive safe \\ncare. Our frontline providers need to have effective training on VHA\\'s \\nnational policies and procedures. They must also be capable of using \\nVHA\\'s tools for monitoring health care delivery. We need our training \\nto empower employees and make it easy for every employee to do the \\nright thing every time.\\n    Concerning resource needs and allocation priorities, VHA is moving \\nforward with implementing an enterprise-wide planning, programming, \\nbudget and execution program that will ensure our medical care planning \\nand prioritization drives our budget request and execution. Using this \\nprogram, we will be able to prioritize resource needs and budget for \\neffective implementation of national policies and procedures, including \\nbudgeting for training and human capital.\\n              export telemedicine from alaska to the u.s.\\n    Question 3.  Dr. Clancy, Alaska is home to the highest per capita \\npopulation of veterans in the country. As of August 2014, Alaska had \\nnearly 75,000 veterans, nearly one-tenth of our population. Alaska also \\nis about two and half times the size of Texas, with over 663,000 sq. \\nmiles of area. Because of the amount of area in Alaska, my state leads \\nthe Nation in telemedicine and telehealth delivery, ensuring that \\nAlaskan, wherever they are, receive the best quality and most cost-\\neffective treatment possible. In fact, one area where Alaska is \\nbreaking the mold where many native veterans who live in bush Alaska no \\nlonger have to take multiple days off to fly into Anchorage to see \\ntheir doctor and can instead VTC with their doctor from their local \\nhealth clinic. While I troubled by GAO\\'s Report which cite a 9-year, \\n$127 million failed attempt to upgrade the VA\\'s scheduling software and \\nan longstanding failure to integrate Electronic Health Records for VA \\nand the Department of Defense, I like to see the glass a half full. In \\nthis case, a half full glass is that there is a lot of room for \\nimprovement with the right investments and a culture that is willing to \\nthink outside the box. Alaska\\'s exports many things to the U.S. are \\nfamous, including oil., salmon, and minerals. Dr. Clancy, how can the \\nVHA take what is being done in Alaskan telemedicine and telehealth and \\nexport it to the Lower 48?\\n    Response. VHA strives to continually look across all systems for \\nbest practices. Fortunately the Alaska VA system has been a source of \\ninspiration across the VHA system in regards to telehealth and \\ntelemedicine. We must use the examples from the Alaska VA system to \\nfocus on providing care when and how the Veteran needs it.\\n    VHA is recognized as a world leader in the development and use of \\ntelehealth. More than 717,000 Veterans accessed VHA care through \\ntelehealth in fiscal year (FY) 2014, 45 percent of these Veterans live \\nin rural or highly rural areas. The FY 2014 total for Veterans using \\ntelehealth represented an 18% growth from the year before. Telehealth \\nservices provide access to health care in more than 45 different \\nspecialty areas, including areas in which VHA has particular expertise \\nthat may not be available from the local community health care \\nprovider.\\n    The Alaska VA Healthcare System based in Anchorage has progressive \\nclinical and executive leadership who maximize the use of telehealth to \\nmeet the specialized needs of our Veterans in Alaska. For example, \\nAlaska\\'s Veterans access VHA care through Teledermatology, Teleretinal \\nimaging for annual screening for diabetic retinopathy eye disease, Home \\nTelehealth for monitoring and management of chronic conditions like \\ndiabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart \\nfailure. Veterans in Alaska use clinical video telehealth to access \\ntheir Primary Care Providers based in Colorado and Florida, and Patient \\nAligned Care Teams (PACT) based in Idaho at the Boise Primary Care Hub. \\nThe PACT multidisciplinary teams include social workers, clinical \\npharmacists, mental health and primary care providers. All of the \\nAlaska VA Healthcare System\\'s Community-Based Outpatient Clinics \\n(CBOC), located in in Kenai, Fairbanks, and the Mat-Su clinic in \\nWasilla, offer telehealth services. In some instances Veterans in the \\nCBOC use telehealth to access care from providers at the main Medical \\nCenter, and sometimes they access care from providers at another CBOC. \\nLast fiscal year in Alaska more than 1,800 Veterans accessed VHA care \\nthrough telehealth, and more than 330 Veterans benefited from Home \\nTelehealth. VA\\'s Alaska Healthcare System is able to share its most \\nsuccessful telehealth strategies with the other 150 VA medical centers \\nand 800 CBOCs across the country. These best practices are conveyed \\nthrough the 15 year old VHA Telehealth Community which uses multiple \\nmethods to share information including weekly Program Manager \\nconference calls, monthly National Forums, quarterly newsletters, and \\nannual conferences.\\n    The ability to collaborate with the Native Healthcare Systems, \\nlocal community resources, and DOD has led to success in providing \\naccess to Alaska\\'s Veterans. The use of telemedicine within Alaska and \\nwith VA facilities in other states has provided access to Veterans in \\nmultiple communities located across the vast Alaskan terrain. These \\nrelationships are crucial to ensure the health care needs of Alaska\\'s \\nVeterans are met.\\n    In 2011, a policy decision from VA Central Office required the \\nAlaska VA to provide healthcare services within the state whenever \\navailable rather than transferring Veterans to VA facilities in Seattle \\nor Portland for care. Each Veteran was given the option for local care \\nin the private sector, or referral to other VA facilities. Only rarely \\nhave Veterans chosen to travel to Seattle or Portland VA for care. The \\nAlaska VA Healthcare System has a strong program in place to coordinate \\nprivate sector care. Additional staff were added to ensure coordination \\nof care and that Veterans\\' needs were being met. For example, with the \\nincrease in oncology care being provided in state, the Alaska VA \\nestablished an oncology team to ensure the requirements for care \\npurchased in the community was well defined and accomplished.\\n    In August 2013, the Alaska VA began purchasing primary care in the \\ncommunity. This was due to high turnover and the inability to hire new \\nproviders despite the use of recruitment incentives. The shortage of \\nprimary care providers led to increased wait times for Veterans. \\nWorking with community providers and Native Healthcare Organizations, \\nthe Alaska VA was able to obtain primary care services for those \\nVeterans who had been waiting the longest for care. As new Veterans \\napplied for care, the Alaska VA continued to use these community \\nproviders to obtain timely primary care. Also, through 26 sharing \\nagreements, care for Native and Non-Native Alaska Veterans living in \\nrural Alaska was purchased across the state. Tanana Chief Conference in \\nFairbanks and South Central Foundation in Mat Su Valley have the \\nlargest number of Veterans receiving primary care at their facilities. \\nIn addition, VA entered into contracts with multiple private sector \\nhealthcare organizations in order to meet the access requirements of \\nVeterans. Staff members were assigned to function as liaisons with \\nspecific community providers. Positive feedback has been received from \\nVeterans referred to these organizations. There is ongoing \\ncommunication across multiple levels of the Alaska VA -from Executive \\nleadership to frontline staff. Extensive care coordination between VA \\nand these community healthcare organizations is required and a \\ncontinual VA presence to ensure continuity of care and issue \\nresolution. That continuity is provided through VHA\\'s Integrated Care \\nService. Due to the large number of Veterans referred to South Central \\nFoundation (SCF) in the Mat Su Valley, several VA employees are \\nassigned to work with SCF to ensure consults are managed efficiently \\nand appropriate medical record information is exchanged. To ensure \\nongoing communication, planning and conflict resolution is critical for \\nthe Alaska VA Chief of Staff and the Chief of the Chief of Integrated \\nCare Services. These relationships have developed over several years of \\nfrequent interactions, face-to-face dialog and understanding of \\ncultural sensitivities.\\n    Another important component of the Alaska VA Healthcare System\\'s \\nsuccess is the establishment of a robust rural outreach team made up of \\nadministrative and clinical staff. This group has ongoing contact with \\nrural communities including tribal leaders, healthcare organizations, \\ncommunity elders and Veterans. Over 200 volunteers have been trained as \\nTribal Veteran Representatives and function as liaisons between VA, \\nVeterans, and rural health organizations.\\n    The Alaska VA also has a sharing agreement with the 673rd DOD/VA \\nJoint Venture hospital in Anchorage for emergency care, urgent care, \\nand inpatient care to include Intensive Care unit. By using the \\nmilitary resources as a right of first refusal for specialty care, the \\nsharing of health care resources provides VA a cost effective resource \\nfor specialty care needs.\\n    In addition, teleprimary care providers located in Boise, ID; Bay \\nPines, Florida; and Denver, Colorado are used to provide care for \\nAnchorage Veterans. This augments care and serves as a bridge during \\nprovider shortages. Veterans receiving teleprimary care have expressed \\nhigh levels of satisfaction with the care received.\\n           alaskan wait time success and translating further\\n    Question 4.  Dr. Clancy, in figures recently compiled by the \\nAssociated Press showing a snapshot of in time wait time information \\nfor 940 VA hospitals and outpatient clinics nationwide, the shows that \\n``an average of less than 1 percent of completed appointments at the \\nAnchorage outpatient clinic--0.90 percent--involved delays of at least \\n31 days from the veteran\\'s preferred appointment date during that \\nperiod. In fact, averages were lower at facilities in Wasilla, \\nFairbanks and Kenai.\\'\\' Nationally, about 2.8 percent of completed \\nappointments involved delays of more than 30 days. In sum, Alaska has \\nless than 1% of veterans waiting over 30 days when over 20% of the \\nstate\\'s population lives in rural areas, many of which are hundreds of \\nmiles from VA facilities. Can the VHA use some of what is being done in \\nthe Alaska VA system and use it as a model to help other areas of the \\nU.S.? What specific lessons can be learned from Alaska?\\n    Response. A primary strength of the Alaska VA Healthcare System is \\nits success in establishing strong relationships with community \\nproviders. Through these relationships VA is able to provide \\naccessible, timely, coordinated, and high quality care for Veterans. VA \\ncommunity providers include DOD and the Native Healthcare \\nOrganizations, as well as multiple community providers and smaller \\nhealth care systems across the state. The ability of the Alaska VA \\nSystem to use purchased care is based upon the knowledge that \\nrelationship-building and open communication are the key to instill a \\ncommon mission and shared vision among all providers and stakeholders. \\nTo strengthen relationships in the community, the Alaska VA Healthcare \\nSystem will assign specifically trained VA staff to work with the \\nprovider\\'s health care facility, thereby encouraging frequent face-to-\\nface contact and close communication. Open dialog engenders mutual \\ntrust and empathy, promoting a shared mission with a focus on ICARE \\nvalues, which then can be better actualized by community providers as \\nwell by the health care team at the VA facility. This ``one standard of \\ncare for all Veterans\\'\\' concept is an expectation of all community \\nproviders of the Alaska VA Healthcare System and promotes excellent \\naccess, continuity, and care coordination. Positive feedback has been \\nreceived from Veterans, whether receiving care in the community or at \\ntheir VA facility. Seamless integration of care between VA and \\ncommunity providers, facilitated by a strong foundation of trust and a \\nsense of shared mission, enables the Alaska VA to provide the needed \\ncare for Veterans efficiently and effectively.\\n    The Alaska VA\\'s approach has important implications for VA care at \\nsites in other states. A close and transparent network between the VA \\nand surrounding community health care providers can improve access, \\ncontinuity, care coordination and overall quality of care. VA and \\ncommunity health care networks can be best created through proactive \\nefforts to facilitate close communication and relationship building. \\nVHA anticipates and welcomes a future of close cooperation between VA \\nand community health care programs. The goal is to develop a network of \\ncoordinated, integrated health-related services that provide seamless \\ncare for all Veterans.\\n\\n    Question 5.  Dr. Clancy, what suggestions do you have to help \\ncreate a culture at the VA that rewards this type of achievement--even \\nincentivizes it--so that the VA and VHA do not end on the GAO\\'s high \\nrisk list AND more importantly, so that our veterans get the care they \\nhave earned?\\n    Response. In order for VHA to be successful we must ensure that \\nVeteran outcomes are always our priority; In order to do this, we must \\nlook for a uniform platform with local components that celebrates \\ninnovation across the organization. This is accomplished through the \\nSecretaries ``MyVA\\'\\' initiative. As a part of ``MyVA\\'\\' we have begun to \\nactively solicit employees to provide process improvement ideas and to \\ntake an active role in improving the Veteran Experience. We already \\nhave begun to examine how to expand Lean Concepts system wide which \\nwill help foster idea formation across the organization.\\n                        culture change at the va\\n    Question 6. VA and the VHA are getting beaten up a lot in the media \\nand in Congress. While a lot of this aggressive oversight is justified, \\na group of people can only take so much of this type of oversight \\nbefore they become timid and simply check the box to not get in \\ntrouble. That is not the type of culture we want at the VA.\\n    What suggestions do you have to improve the culture at the VHA and \\nthe VA as a whole?\\n    Response. The Blueprint for Excellence lays the framework for \\nimprovement of the culture of VA, and provides a positive vision for \\nemployees. Recent shortcomings of VHA performance highlight the \\nimportance of reconnecting leadership and staff to VA\\'s mission and the \\nexpressed values of the organization, as a basis for cultural \\ntransformation. In addition to creating a positive and ``Veterans-\\nfirst\\'\\' culture of service in VA, this vision seeks to improve Veteran \\nservices by building an environment of continuous learning, facilitated \\nby responsible risk-taking and balanced by personal integrity and \\nconstructive, sustainable accountability. Such an environment \\nreinforces a culture of doing right by the Veteran every time.\\n\\n    Question 7.  What suggestions to do you have actually encourage \\ninnovation and new ideas?\\n    Response. The Secretary has emphasized that the best ideas come \\nfrom those who are closest to the problem. This led to the development \\nof the ``MyVA\\'\\' initiative. This initiative will reorient VA around \\nVeterans\\' needs and empower employees to assist by delivering excellent \\ncustomer service to improve the Veteran\\'s experience. ``MyVA\\'\\' actually \\nworks to identify best practices to amplify issues and develop \\nsolutions. We must combat non-productive activity and waste, such as \\nproduction defects, overproduction, waiting, underutilization of \\ntalent, excess motion, and extra processing. Supported by senior \\nmanagers and leaders, front-line workers through mid-level management \\nstaff will be recruited to identify opportunities for innovation \\nthroughout their work areas. The ``MyVA\\'\\' brings together all members \\nof the organization focused on continued learning and working to ensure \\nstate-of-the-art care for our nations Veterans.\\n    VA leadership has been instructed to continue to seek feedback and \\nideas from Veterans, employees, community partners and stakeholders \\nthrough the use of town hall forums. In addition, we have instituted \\nthe \\'\\'MyVA Idea House;\\'\\' an intranet web tool, where employees from \\nacross VA can submit ideas online to improve services, streamline \\nprocesses and solve issues for Veterans and their families.\\n\\n    Question 8.  What authorities can Congress give you to help these \\ninnovations and ideas cut through the existing VA and VHA \\nbureaucracies?\\n    Response. Congress has been extremely helpful as we continue to \\nwork to transform VA\\'s organizational culture and become the VA that \\nour Veterans want and deserve. We look forward to working with Congress \\nto help us fill needed personnel shortages across our system. Also, by \\nhelping us to get the message out that VA has a laudable mission and is \\na great place to work.\\n\\n    Question 9.  How can we create excellence at the VA?\\n    Response. We can create excellence in the VA by continually looking \\nfor ways to improve our system and by putting the Veterans Experience \\nprincipal in all we do.\\n    We must recruit and retain the best and brightest and give them the \\ntools necessary to provide the very best care possible to our nations \\nVeterans who have earned it. We also must seek to learn from mistakes \\nand prevent reoccurrence.\\n\\n      \\n\\n                                  [all]\\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body></html>\\n'}, 'CHRG-114hhrg97496': {'raw_text': '<html>\\n<title> - [H.A.S.C.

Joseph J. Heck \\n(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.\\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH J. HECK, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM \\n      NEVADA, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON MILITARY PERSONNEL\\n\\n    Dr. Heck. We will go ahead and call the hearing to order \\nagain. I apologize for the delay.\\n    Just as a disclaimer, we are going to have another vote \\nseries somewhere around 4:50 to 5:20. So while we did ask \\ninitially for the witnesses to make their statements 5 minutes \\nin length, we are going to ask if you can try to condense it to \\n3 minutes to the best of your ability. And we will make sure \\nthat your written statements are entered in their entirety into \\nthe record. Our hope is to at least get through the first panel \\nbefore the next vote series.\\n    So I want to welcome everyone to this hearing where our \\nfocus is on the collaboration between the Department of Defense \\nand private organizations to assist service members who are \\ntransitioning to civilian life.\\n    We are all well aware that the Army and the Marine Corps \\nare downsizing, with a plan to reduce 40,000 soldiers and 2,000 \\nMarines by 2018. Undoubtedly, such cuts put strain on our \\nservice members and their families. These reductions in end \\nstrengths represent additional service members that will be \\nasked to leave the military on top of the more than 165,000 \\nservice members that separate every year.\\n    We owe these transitioning service members and their \\nfamilies a robust system that prepares them for life after the \\nmilitary. We want to make sure they can continue to make the \\nsame caliber of contributions to society once they take their \\nuniforms off that they made to our Nation\\'s security while in \\nuniform.\\n    Today\\'s hearing continues our commitment to ensuring that \\nthe Transition Assistance Program meets the needs of \\ntransitioning service members, not only through a whole-of-\\ngovernment approach but also by partnering with organizations \\nwho share our commitment to help service members successfully \\ntransition from military service.\\n    I am interested to hear from our first panel how they \\nconnect with individuals who are leaving the military and what \\nservices they offer to assist. I am also interested to hear \\nfrom our DOD [Department of Defense] and military services how \\nthey include organizations such as those represented here today \\nin the Transition Assistance Program.\\n    In response to the increasing need to help prepare \\nindividuals for post-service opportunities such as employment, \\nhigher education, or entrepreneurial endeavors, Congress and \\nDOD have continually worked to improve the Transition \\nAssistance Program. So I am interested to hear from our DOD and \\nmilitary service witnesses whether the recent changes have \\nproduced the desired results. For example, in your view, are \\nservice members transitioning today better prepared for post-\\nservice life as compared to those transitioning 5 years ago?\\n    With that, I want to welcome our witnesses, and I look \\nforward to our testimony.\\n    Before I introduce our first panel, let me offer \\nCongresswoman Susan Davis an opportunity to make her opening \\nremarks.\\n    Mrs. Davis.\\n    [The prepared statement of Dr. Heck can be found in the \\nAppendix on page 35.]\\n\\n    STATEMENT OF HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM \\n CALIFORNIA, RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON MILITARY PERSONNEL\\n\\n    Mrs. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    As we know, each year, over 100,000 service members \\ntransition out of Active military service back into civilian \\nsociety. The Department and the military services have made \\nconsiderable strides--my notes here say ``great strides.\\'\\' I am \\nnot so sure I am willing to say ``great strides,\\'\\' but \\nconsiderable strides toward improving the Transition Assistance \\nProgram. It has evolved from one mandatory class to an \\nintegrated effort between the service member, the chain of \\ncommand, and the transition assistance cadre, spanning several \\nmonths or even longer, to ensure our young men and women are \\nset up for success.\\n    Although improvements have definitely been made, as our \\nwitnesses I know will attest today, there is still much work to \\nbe done. Our first panel represents one area in which the \\nDepartment needs continued improvement and involvement, working \\nwith qualified civilian organizations that maintain the \\nmomentum of transitioning service members back into society. I \\ncertainly look forward to hearing from our first panel on their \\ntwo different approaches to helping service members transition. \\nBoth of these organizations, of course, are innovative and \\npotentially life-changing.\\n    We will also be hearing from the second panel on how DOD \\nand the services plan to work with organizations such as \\nzero8hundred and American Dream U to improve successful \\ntransition of our service members back into the community. \\nDefinitely, their response to what you present and you bring is \\nvery important to us, as well.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to our witnesses.\\n    Dr. Heck. Great.\\n    So I will introduce our first panel. We have Mr. Phil \\nRandazzo, founder of American Dream U; Mr. Scott Mann with \\nAmerican Dream U; and Mr. Sean Mahoney, Executive Director of \\nzero8hun-\\ndred.\\n    Again, I ask the witnesses to condense, to the best of \\ntheir ability, their testimony.\\n    And, with that, Mr. Randazzo, you are recognized for 3 \\nminutes.\\n\\n     STATEMENT OF PHIL RANDAZZO, FOUNDER, AMERICAN DREAM U\\n\\n    Mr. Randazzo. Chairman Dr. Heck, Ranking Member Susan \\nDavis, and distinguished members of the committee, it is truly \\nan honor to be invited to testify in front of such an esteemed \\nbody. Thank you for the opportunity.\\n    If we had to assure that every single veteran transitioning \\nout of the military was able to extract every ounce of clarity \\nand value from his or her own experience, resume, drive, \\ndiscipline, personality, and follow-through to have the best \\nchance, to get the best job, how would we in this room do that?\\n    In founding American Dream U, I have had the opportunity to \\nbring in over 140 world-class entrepreneurs and business \\nleaders across 8 installations, including the Pentagon. They \\nhave shared their successes, failures, insights, tactics, and \\nstrategies with Active Duty military, spouses, dependents, and \\nveterans.\\n    I would like everyone in this room to look back and think \\nand connect the dots, how they got here. I would argue that it \\nis the people you met and the books you read, not the books you \\nread in high school or in college, but the books that were \\nrecommended to you by friends and colleagues; not the people \\nyou met in college or in high school, but maybe a company \\ncommander, an event you attended, or a friend introduction.\\n    What I have noticed is some negative talk surrounding \\nbecoming an entrepreneur or entrepreneurial thinking. The \\nservice members are getting pigeonholed into whatever their MOS \\n[military occupational specialty] was in the military for job \\nopportunities during transitioning. From speaking to hundreds \\nof service members, I am not convinced this is a path to a \\nsuccessful transition.\\n    I had the opportunity to speak to the folks at the VA \\n[Department of Veterans Affairs], when discussion of becoming \\nan entrepreneur came up, we heard, ``Ninety-six percent of \\nbusinesses fail. We want them to have a degree, that \\ncertificate on the wall, plan B.\\'\\' Does that general degree \\ncarry as much weight as it does in 2015?\\n    Dozens of service members at our conferences have asked \\nthis question: ``We have been trained since the first day of \\nboot camp that failure is not an option; it results in a \\nteammate getting injured or killed. We have heard from all your \\nspeakers that failure is okay and even encouraged. I am \\nstruggling with this.\\'\\' I think the discussion during the \\ntransition needs to address this. It is okay to fail in the \\ncivilian world. Everyone in this room has had failures, and \\nthat is okay, even valuable.\\n    I think the people who run transition are great Americans. \\nI am not convinced they are open to new ideas, up to the latest \\ntactics and strategies, or emphasize the importance of finding \\nyour purpose, self-education, the value of networking, and \\nfinding a great mentor. Self-education is extremely important.\\n    In 2015 and beyond, the area of focus needs to be in the \\ntechnology space, robotics, health care, finances. Nano \\ncertificates, job apprenticeships, and job shadowings need to \\nbe encouraged.\\n    Twelve months before transitioning out of the military, I \\nthink every veteran, soldier, marine, airman, sailor, \\ncoastguardsman, spouse should read books like ``Start With \\nWhy\\'\\' by Simon Sinek, ``Think and Grow Rich\\'\\' by Napoleon Hill, \\n``How to Win Friends and Influence People\\'\\' by Dale Carnegie. \\nSimon Sinek has been paid by several installations and has \\nspoken at the Pentagon. We think we can do better.\\n    In working with hundreds of businesses over my 20-plus-\\nyears career as an entrepreneur, the number-one hiring criteria \\nis finding those that are flexible, resourceful, show \\ninitiative, work well with teams, and show up on time. This \\ndefines the veteran. We owe our military to strive to do \\nbetter.\\n    It has been an honor and a privilege to work with our \\nmilitary, and I am constantly humbled in their presence.\\n    I look forward to your questions or comments.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Randazzo can be found in the \\nAppendix on page 36.]\\n    Dr. Heck. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Mann.\\n\\n           STATEMENT OF SCOTT MANN, AMERICAN DREAM U\\n\\n    Mr. Mann. Chairman Heck, Ranking Member Susan Davis, and \\ndistinguished members of the committee, thanks for the \\nopportunity to tell you the transition story of warriors, our \\nwarriors, who just don\\'t seem to have quite the voice these \\ndays that they probably should.\\n    I have spent my entire life as a U.S. Army Special Forces \\nGreen Beret, and in those 22 years of service in many dark \\nplaces around the world, one thing I have learned is the \\nbenefit of going local, immersing yourself in the problem to \\nget a perspective of what is going on. And that is the \\nperspective that I would like to provide you today on \\ntransition.\\n    As an entrepreneur and advocate for nonprofit work in \\ntransition, I work with military members as I train them in \\nspecial skills but also working with them as they prepare to \\nleave the service that they know and love.\\n    The other day, I was talking to a special ops master \\nsergeant, I will call him Steve, who was going through \\ntransition from the Army. And I hadn\\'t seen him in a while, so \\nI asked him how things were going. Do you know what he told me? \\nHe said that he would rather go back to Afghanistan four more \\ntimes than to ever go through transition again.\\n    How is that possible? Here is a man who has known more \\npain, suffered more family stress, lost more friends, and seen \\nmore violence than any warrior I know of, yet he would go back \\nand do it all again four more times than to ever go through \\ntransition again. Something isn\\'t working.\\n    The challenges of transition, having gone through them \\nmyself, are enormous. Our service men and women have been \\nfighting the longest war in our Nation\\'s history. The corrosive \\narena of combat is placing unprecedented strain on not just our \\nmilitary men and women but their families. They face a massive \\ndrawdown, as well. And as ISIS [Islamic State in Iraq and \\nSyria] and other extremist groups expand, the stress of \\noperational tempo on those service members who remain in \\nservice is likely to go even higher, which is going to mean \\nless time for them to prepare for transition and even more \\nstress for transition in the future.\\n    Whether these warriors get out of the military unexpectedly \\ndue to a drawdown or whether they get out on a scheduled \\ndeparture, as I did, they will likely have fresh dust on their \\nboots, gunpowder residue on their hands, and not a lot of time \\nto even remotely contemplate the challenges of transition. Add \\nthese to a tough economy and a low job market, and it is no \\nwonder that many of our veterans are terrified of coming home.\\n    Now, that is the tough news. But let\\'s not forget that \\nthese warriors are high performers. They are complex problem \\nsolvers. Our warriors possess immense leadership skills that, \\nfrankly, society is demanding more and more every day. So the \\nquestion is, how do we bring them home and integrate them into \\nthe communities that desperately need their leadership and \\ntheir loyalty?\\n    Well, again, this Green Beret\\'s perspective from the \\nvillage, a few things: One, this problem is probably going to \\nget worse before it gets better. Two, the current DOD and VA \\nprograms of transition are simply overmatched for this massive \\nundertaking. And, three, the private sector is essential in \\nbringing home our veterans to a life of honor and happiness.\\n    To expound a bit further,and I hope I get a chance to \\nexpand on this today, is we must help our veterans reconnect to \\ntheir higher purpose. We should connect our veterans to \\nrelevant civilian players in the community. And we need to \\nempower veterans to learn how to tell their story when they \\ncome home. I believe that this is a challenge for both the \\nprivate sector and the public sector and that history is going \\nto judge us on our ability to do that.\\n    One of my best friends and former soldiers, Romy Camargo, a \\nquadriplegic wounded in Afghanistan 7 years ago, working with \\njust a six-person advisory board from the community in Tampa, \\nFlorida, in just over a year managed to raise $750,000 and open \\na nonprofit center that is treating dozens of people, to \\ninclude severely wounded veterans.\\n    My belief is that if the community can come together under \\nthose kinds of extreme situations, there is nothing that we \\ncan\\'t do when we partner with folks like Mr. Randazzo and our \\nmilitary leadership.\\n    Thank you for your time.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Mann can be found in the \\nAppendix on page 43.]\\n    Dr. Heck. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Mahoney.\\n\\n  STATEMENT OF SEAN MAHONEY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ZERO8HUNDRED\\n\\n    Mr. Mahoney. Chairman Heck, Ranking Member Davis, \\ndistinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the \\nopportunity to appear today. I would like to explain a \\npartnership with military bases in San Diego that provides a \\ncommunity handoff from transition classes.\\n    Every year, approximately 20,000 service members stationed \\nin San Diego County leave the service, and 30 percent are \\nexpected to stay in the area. Many of these individuals \\nexperience difficulty with transition.\\n    San Diego community leaders realized that numerous \\norganizations were there to assist but there was a gap between \\nthese resources and service members, who are often unaware of \\nthem. These leaders developed a plan to close this gap without \\nduplicating existing services. This was called the Military \\nTransition Support Project [MTSP] and implemented as \\n``zero8hundred\\'\\' to illustrate the promise that comes with a \\nnew day.\\n    Zero8hundred addresses four areas of veterans\\' wellness: \\nemployment and education, health, basic needs, and personal \\nconnections. Zero8hundred provides transition support from 9 \\nmonths prior to separation to 12 months afterwards. This begins \\nwith a presentation on base at Navy and Coast Guard transition \\nclasses, where those remaining in San Diego County have the \\nopportunity to opt in.\\n    These zero8hundred clients are called VIPs, for Veterans or \\nSpouses in Process, and they get proactive check-ins, starting \\nwith a call the following week from a zero8hundred navigator or \\ncaseworker. All of our caseworkers are either veterans, \\nmilitary dependents, or spouses, and all are in a master\\'s of \\nsocial work program or have a master\\'s of social work.\\n    The partnership with local military bases began in 2013 \\nwith a memorandum of understanding [MOU] with Navy Region \\nSouthwest that was signed in 2014. That allows the program to \\nbe presented during the classes. The MOU also indicates that \\nMTSP\\'s zero8hundred is responsible for providing an essential \\norganizing point for community resources. The program does this \\nby utilizing 2-1-1, San Diego\\'s database of 6,000 vetted \\nresources in the community, to make them available to anyone \\nwho is transitioning.\\n    We train Navy contract instructors to make the \\npresentations in the TGPS [Transition, Goals, Plans, Success] \\nclasses and began at Naval Base San Diego in January of this \\nyear. We expanded to Naval Base Coronado in February and the \\nCoast Guard in March.\\n    The first 2 years of the program are the pilot phase, and \\nthe goal of the initial stage was to evaluate the impact on the \\nfirst 300 VIPs. Response has been very positive, and we hit \\nthis 300 enrollment goal 8 months into the program. It has been \\npresented on 89 transition classes on base, and over 30 percent \\nof eligible personnel have opted into the program. Many also \\nchoose to self-navigate to resources via our Web site, and \\n9,000 sessions have been recorded.\\n    Zero8hundred navigators have been reaching out to these \\nVIPs to discuss their challenges, to handle case management, \\nand to offer warm referrals to organizations that can assist \\nthem, and then follow up to see how they were helped. \\nUniversity of San Diego\\'s Caster Family Center is conducting a \\nthird-party evaluation to measure outcomes.\\n    We value our positive relationship with the military bases \\nthat help make this community initiative possible. And I want \\nto thank you, and I look forward to your questions.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Mahoney can be found in the \\nAppendix on page 51.]\\n    Dr. Heck. Thank you.\\n    I thank you all for being so succinct in your opening \\ncomments. Hopefully, we will have enough time to delve more \\ndeeply into your written testimony as well as the questions.\\n    Mr. Randazzo, tell us how you connect with individuals who \\nare leaving the military to introduce them to American Dream U \\nand the programs you offer. How do you get access to them? Are \\nyou going on base? Is it base-to-base? Is it a pilot program? \\nHow are you reaching out and touching those lives?\\n    Mr. Randazzo. Yeah, so we just came back from Fort Bragg, \\nand we were invited by the DC [deputy commander] General Jeff \\nSmith. And so we work, typically, with the garrison and then \\nthe TAP [Transition Assistance Program]. And then we have also \\nbeen introduced to the BOSS, the Better Opportunity for Single \\nSoldiers. We did an event for their national conference last \\nmonth, where Mr. Mann spoke.\\n    And so we are going to be hitting all of the Transition and \\nthe BOSS. And so we have done 13 events, Mr. Chairman, at 9 \\ndifferent installations. We have had a little over 4,000 \\nattend. And I can provide feedback from those.\\n    Dr. Heck. But how do you get access or how do you get to \\neach one of those locations? Is it by invitation? Or are you \\ngoing and soliciting and saying, ``Hey, we are here. Can we \\ncome on base?\\'\\' How does that work?\\n    Mr. Randazzo. So we have been working through the CGs \\n[commanding generals], through the commanders. So Fort Bragg \\nwas our third event. So they saw something in the first event, \\nso they invited us back for a second and third. We have been to \\nFort Hood twice. We are heading back to Fort Benning for a \\nsecond time. So we have asked to come, and then we have been \\ninvited back.\\n    Dr. Heck. Okay.\\n    So has there been any thought given or any attempts made to \\napproach DOD of making this, you know, a program that is \\noffered automatically across installations, as opposed to you \\nhaving to go and, you know, present yourself to each CG at each \\ninstallation and get access?\\n    Mr. Randazzo. I wouldn\\'t even know, Chairman, how to even--\\n--\\n    Dr. Heck. Okay.\\n    Mr. Randazzo [continuing]. Start to ask the DOD to be a \\npart of the program.\\n    Dr. Heck. Yeah, neither would we, but we will get to that.\\n    So it is clear from your testimony that American Dream U \\nfocuses on entrepreneurship and leading within organizations. \\nIt is kind of like the ``Shark Tank\\'\\' of transition.\\n    TAP GPS [Goals, Plans, Success] includes optional tracks, \\none of which focuses on entrepreneurship. Are you familiar with \\nthat track? And if so, what is your view of the information \\nprovided? And what recommendations do you have to improve that \\nprogram?\\n    Mr. Randazzo. So I would like to be clear: So we are not \\njust entrepreneurship programs. We talk about different tactics \\nand strategies to find jobs. I didn\\'t get to it in my opening \\nstatement, but LinkedIn is not talked about in class, and I \\nheard today that it is going to start to be. I think that is a \\nvery effective way to get connected with jobs. We talk a lot \\nabout different tactics on how to find a job that you actually \\ndon\\'t need an alarm clock to wake up to go to.\\n    But, yeah, so I have reviewed all the Boots to Business \\nprogram that is run by the SBA [Small Business Association]. I \\nthink it is very academic. I am an entrepreneur, and I like to \\nlearn from people who have actually done it. And so I think \\npart of our program being effective is bringing in those \\nentrepreneurs and kind of cutting in line, learning from the \\nmasters, versus maybe reading out of a manual. But I think it \\nis definitely a start if someone wants to be an entrepreneur.\\n    Dr. Heck. Great. Thank you.\\n    Mrs. Davis.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Thank you all again for being here.\\n    I remember quite a number of years ago how difficult it was \\nto start coordinating some of the efforts out there. And it \\nseemed like everybody wanted to help, which was wonderful, but, \\non the other hand, it was really important to try and figure \\nout what the goals were, I think, for different organizations.\\n    And so I am wondering whether the programs that you know \\nabout in other areas--and your focus has been on the \\nentrepreneurial piece of that, to a certain extent, and Mr. \\nMann as well. I am thinking with Mr. Mahoney--whether does all \\nthat sort of resonate together? Or do you see these programs as \\ndistinctly very, very different?\\n    Mr. Mahoney. Ma\\'am, I can give our perspective on that.\\n    Zero8hundred welcomes the different diverse programs that \\nare out there. I think they are different, and I think that \\nthat is great, even if there is some overlapping. But we would \\nlike to be in a position to offer two or three solutions to a \\nservice member when they get out and refer them to them and see \\nwhich one they choose, which one is best for them. So I think \\nthat that is excellent.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Uh-huh. So providing multiple tracks but also \\nyou are, perhaps by the emphasis, you are able to do a lot in \\nthat area.\\n    Mr. Mann. Correct. And with my smaller nonprofit, Mission \\nAmerica, and working closely with Mr. Randazzo, you are right, \\nI mean, there are tens of thousands of nonprofits out there, \\nall, most of them, really trying to do good things. But as a \\nveteran who transitioned, it is overwhelming when you see the \\nnumber of folks out there. It is hard to sort it out.\\n    I believe the doors are wide open right now for a no-\\nkidding, strong private-public partnership on this that is very \\ncollaborative and allows groups like American Dream U and \\nMission America, where I go in and talk to veterans, as a \\nveteran who is an entrepreneur and has transitioned, about what \\nthey are going to see on the other side, to be positioned \\nplayers and be supporting efforts to DOD as they step through \\nthis, just with the acknowledgement that it is more than a TAP \\nprogram, it is really, it is a process.\\n    Transition is a, the Green Beret Foundation calls it ``The \\nNext Ridgeline.\\'\\' It is a long patrol. It is not something that \\nis done in 10 days. It is a process like any other mission. And \\nthat is why I named it Mission America, is because it really is \\nabout getting these guys and gals with the right skill sets and \\nlooking at it as another mission, holistically, beyond just \\njobs and entrepreneurialism. So collaboration is going to be \\nessential.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Uh-huh. Yeah.\\n    If I may, Mr. Mahoney, one of the issues sometimes \\norganizations find is that when they are involved in mentoring \\nprograms or ways in which the community is really playing a \\ncritical role, sometimes that staying power is a little tough \\nto achieve. I think often it is based on having good \\nfacilitators, good follow-up, a kind of esprit de corps among \\nthe people that are engaged in this.\\n    Have you found that to be helpful? How does that happen, \\nyou know, that you have people who really are staying with the \\ncause and feel very, very much indebted? It is a two-way \\nstreet. You know, it is not that person is sacrificing by being \\npart of this program, but getting so much out of it.\\n    And so I wanted you to speak to that for a second and, \\nalso, how that is happening in your Tier 3-level VIPs, whether \\nyou are finding a need to have people with special skill sets \\nthat really are able to relate far better to Tier 3 VIPs.\\n    Mr. Mahoney. Yes, ma\\'am. I would say that it is a challenge \\nsometimes to get people to continue to focus on their own \\ntransition as they are getting out. And one of the lessons that \\nwe have learned is it is more difficult for us--our VIPs to \\nenroll 9 months prior to separation, and they are much more \\nactively involved in their transition maybe 90 days before they \\nget out, because they start to realize that it is coming up \\nvery quickly. So we do get a change in their focus at that \\npoint.\\n    I will say, on the flip side of it, in the veteran\\'s \\ncommunity, there is a lot of commitment for folks to stay with \\nthe cause and help them out. And a lot of times they are \\nfrustrated that the service members aren\\'t coming to them.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Oh, okay. Yeah.\\n    In those situations, then, who works to try and make sure \\nthat that relationship is building so that it is a satisfactory \\none on both sides?\\n    Mr. Mahoney. We do, ma\\'am. Well, one thing we do is we have \\nthe different--many of the different resources and agencies \\ncome meet with our navigators, so our navigators are familiar \\nwith many of the different nonprofits and their different areas \\nof emphasis. And that way, when our navigators explain the \\nresources that are available to the VIP, they can explain it in \\na way that it is really a handoff. It is a personal connection, \\nthat they will do a personal referral and a warm handoff to \\nthat agency.\\n    And to answer your question about the Tier 3, it is hit or \\nmiss. I mean, some of our folks are Tier 3, where they may be a \\nsingle mom getting out with a small child. Maybe they are going \\nto be evicted in a week. And they might be very, very engaged \\nwith our navigators. And some, it is frustrating that they will \\nbe engaged and then they will drop off and try to handle things \\nthemselves.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Does there seem to be a difference whether you \\nare in face-to-face contact or by telephone, by cell? What are \\nyou advising people to use, in terms of their method of \\nengaging?\\n    Mr. Mahoney. We engage mostly by phone, ma\\'am. And then for \\na Tier 3 VIP, we would encourage them to come into the office.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Okay. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Randazzo, you mentioned that you hadn\\'t yet--my time is \\nup. We will go another round. Thank you.\\n    Thanks so much.\\n    Dr. Heck. Ms. Tsongas.\\n    Ms. Tsongas. Thank you all for being here. I appreciate the \\ncommitment you obviously all demonstrate as you are responding \\nto different needs that you have identified within the \\ntransition services that are being provided.\\n    And just to add a little context to that, every year I have \\na meeting with a roundtable of veterans from the 3rd District \\nof Massachusetts. We have a great tradition of service. And, \\njust last week, I was able to meet with them, and, in the \\ncourse of it, I always do ask, sort of, how the programs that \\nare out there are addressing their needs.\\n    We met in a university setting, so I was glad to hear that \\nthe GI Bill had made a real difference for many of those \\nreturning. A good number of them had taken advantage of it, \\nwere at the university and getting the degrees that they needed \\nto go on.\\n    But one of the themes that I really heard was that \\ntransition assistance has to be more than a one-time event and \\nthat it needs to be broad enough to enable veterans to make the \\nmost of all the different services that are out there, so \\nwhether they are medical, financial, educational, whatever it \\nmay be that are open to them and their families.\\n    So even the GI Bill, for example, may not seem like the \\nright thing when you are first getting out of the services, \\nbut, as you ease into your new life, suddenly it looms larger \\nas an opportunity.\\n    And as outreach programs do exist--as I said, you all are \\nresponding to needs that you have identified--I have found that \\nveterans I have spoken to often are not fully aware of the \\nrange of programs or even the existence of the kinds of \\norganizations that you represent and the benefits that are \\navailable to them.\\n    And, again, what we heard, I think, from all of them and \\nhave heard over time is that the program has to reflect a long-\\nterm commitment, that they have to be responsive to them in a \\nlong-term setting, especially in the job market, in the era of \\nseeking jobs, because that market is so dynamic.\\n    So we have an interest in developing entrepreneurs. That is \\na great thing. And I agree with you; the leadership skills that \\nhave been developed for those serving are remarkable, and there \\nare many places for those skills to be exercised. And a \\nmentoring program and an example set is always very good, but \\nsometimes it may get a dream going in your head but you still \\ndon\\'t know how to follow on and realize it.\\n    So I am curious with all of you, as in the job-market \\ncontext--we know all the other needs that are out there--and in \\na very dynamic environment, how are you providing assistance or \\nprograms that reflect the dynamism of our times so that you are \\nnot outdated from day one as somebody is moving from one--\\nthinking about one thing to another to another?\\n    Mr. Randazzo. No, those are all great comments.\\n    So I think what is really important is, today, if they are \\nnot able to tell their story,and I am going to let Mr. Mann, he \\nhas done phenomenal work with having soldiers tell their story, \\nbut the importance of working together as groups.\\n    So when we just go to a base, we spend a weekend with them, \\nand we just don\\'t leave. We give them scripts and tactics to \\nuse, whether it is for salary negotiations or it is even a \\nscript to contact maybe a veteran that works in an organization \\nthat you may want to work with and then use those scripts to \\nget into that organization. Because the days of sending out \\nyour resume just doesn\\'t work. No one is reading resumes; \\ncomputers are reading resumes. Most jobs are found within an \\norganization. So if you can network in and have scripts already \\ntailored towards you and you can just kind of tweak them, I \\nthink it is a very valuable tool. And so those are some of the \\ntools.\\n    And then, when we leave, we set up meet-up groups so they \\ncan meet up as a group and take ownership of it and have \\norganizers within there so that they can hold themselves \\naccountable to making LinkedIn connections, you know, to go to \\nmaybe different events in the community and to network. Very, \\nvery important.\\n    Ms. Tsongas. And those follow-on activities would seem to \\nbe very important. Yeah.\\n    Mr. Mann. Thank you for that question.\\n    I work with veterans at a very grassroots level from all \\nservices, spending a lot of time trying to get our head around \\nwhat is challenging them as they come into transition and then \\ngoing to speak on it. And what I have found is that most of our \\nmilitary warriors today, they absolutely love what they do for \\na living. In fact, it satisfies such a high calling for their \\ninner purpose, and it is so in line with it, they almost don\\'t \\neven think about it.\\n    But what happens is, when they separate from service, there \\nis all this emphasis on getting a job and just stepping into \\ncivil society, and they kind of leave that inner purpose back \\nin their team room, back in their platoon bay, back in their \\nready room, and they are not as aware as they could be and \\nshould be of what it is that really makes them tick. What \\nbrought them in the military? What was it that kept them in the \\nmilitary in those dark times when they lost buddies and \\nfriends?\\n    And when you leave that kind of purpose behind, even if you \\nget a great job, and with the kind of caustic combat that they \\nhave seen, in many cases, it makes transition very tough. So \\njust one thing is getting familiar with each warrior\\'s purpose \\nwell before they transition. You know, that is a very important \\nthing.\\n    The second thing is the ability to tell their story. We are \\nhardwired as warriors not to talk about ourselves. We are \\nhardwired to talk about our teammates and maybe a few other \\nthings, but, for the most part, when they step into civil \\nsociety, they are not telling their story. And folks like Mr. \\nRandazzo and others, they want to hear their stories, because \\nit really has a massive impact. And it has huge healing powers \\non the kind of combat stress that many of these warriors have \\nbeen through.\\n    So teaching them and empowering them to tell their own \\nstory is the second thing that we do at Mission America and \\nthat I work with Bill on.\\n    And then, finally, we call it ``keeping the light on in the \\nteam room.\\'\\' Military warriors are some of the most \\ncollaborative, communicative people in the world. We can go \\ninto any rough spot, and we can figure it out. We will build a \\nteam around it and get it done. For some reason, when we walk \\ninto civil society, we don\\'t do that. We don\\'t stay connected \\nto the team that we had, and we sure don\\'t build new teams.\\n    So those are just three areas where we put a lot of \\nemphasis to hopefully be position players for TAP and others to \\nmeet a need that, if we don\\'t address it, it is going to come \\ncalling at the end.\\n    Ms. Tsongas. Thank you.\\n    I have run out of time, and I am sorry, Mr. Mahoney, I \\ncan\\'t hear your answer.\\n    Thank you.\\n    Dr. Heck. I think we will have time for a second round, so \\nstand by.\\n    Mr. Knight.\\n    Mr. Knight. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\n    You know, it is interesting, when I ETS\\'d [estimated time \\nserved] out of the Army years and years ago, it was go around, \\nmake sure that everything is cleared. You know, everybody is \\nwalking with their briefcase or their folder or whatever. And, \\nof course, on your folder, it says, ``I am ETSing, I am going \\nback to the world,\\'\\' or whatever.\\n    And, to me, back then, that was it. I was applying to \\ncollege. I was going to college. I had a mission, and I was \\nready to go. But a lot of guys were like, ``I don\\'t know what I \\nam going to do. I am going to go home, and I am going to figure \\nit out when I get home.\\'\\' And that seems to be the problem.\\n    Now, I live in a real military area, next to a base. A lot \\nof retirees, a lot of young folks that are coming home, and a \\nlot of people that are trying to transition back into the, kind \\nof, private sector. The biggest thing I see is--and I know the \\nmilitary has changed since I left, but the biggest thing I see \\nis, once they leave the military, there is a little bit of a \\ngap there. And I know some of your organizations step up and \\ntake over that gap. And we have some in my area.\\n    What do we do with those people that say that they have it \\nall figured out? They have done everything that they can, they \\nare going to college, or they have a job, or they are--they \\nhave everything worked out. Because some of those people might \\nnot have it worked out, and, after a couple years, they figure, \\nwhat the heck am I doing?\\n    So do we have something that, maybe not tracks them, but \\ngives them that card and says, hey, look, we would like to talk \\nto you every couple months, or we would like to check in with \\nyou, just make sure you are doing everything--everything is \\ngoing right?\\n    Mr. Mahoney. Yes, sir. Good question.\\n    With our organization, with zero8hundred, we have a case \\nmanagement system that drives those follow-on calls. So we have \\nthe initial call with them right after the class, and then they \\ndiscuss their needs. And as you are kind of alluding to there, \\ntheir needs change over time. They may have everything all \\nwired, and then 3 months later they maybe aren\\'t in that \\nsituation anymore. So those follow-on calls discuss their new \\nneeds and can connect them to resources.\\n    And all those calls are recorded in the case management \\nsystem so that, when that navigator goes back, he can refresh \\nhis memory on his conversation with the customer or client, and \\nhe can start the conversation from that point.\\n    But I think having that 21 months of those check-in calls \\ncan really help the transitioning service member.\\n    Mr. Mann. Thank you, Mr. Knight.\\n    One other best practice that I have seen that seems to work \\npretty well that we might think about sharing with the services \\nis the smaller organizations like special forces and the Navy \\nSEAL, the Honor Foundation, special forces with Next Ridgeline, \\nthe foundations aligned with those outfits do a pretty good job \\nof keeping track of guys as they go deeper into transition. It \\nis a little easier to do that.\\n    But one thing, you know, that might be considered for a \\nbest practice is, with the services, the foundations that are \\naligned with the services could possibly play a role in that \\ndeep tracking like that. Because it is an involved process to \\ndo that. A lot of these guys go off the grid, you know, and \\nthey kind of go dark, and it is hard to do, even in smaller \\norganizations like special forces.\\n    Mr. Knight. Mr. Chair, I want to thank you, and I want to \\nthank these groups. You know, it is a difficult thing, carrying \\na ruck one day in a desert and then, a month later, you are in \\nan office and you are looking around at a different \\nenvironment. So it is a difficult transition.\\n    I appreciate what you are doing.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\n    Mr. Randazzo. Can I make one comment on that?\\n    Mr. Knight. Yes, sir. Absolutely.\\n    Mr. Randazzo. We are only 2 years plus a few months, but we \\ngather their personal email addresses, and for those that have \\nattended our first event, we keep in touch with them weekly \\nwith newsletters. And you are right; sometimes when we are \\nthere it doesn\\'t click. But when they are ready, they are \\nready, and so they will reach out to us.\\n    So we have had some real good success in getting feedback \\nand emails back from maybe a soldier who attended 18 months ago \\nand now they are ready.\\n    Mr. Knight. Very good.\\n    Thanks, Mr. Chair.\\n    Dr. Heck. Mr. Coffman.\\n    Mr. Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    In terms of the transition, what is a briefing on Active \\nDuty in terms of on-the-job training opportunities and \\napprenticeship training opportunities run by the VA?\\n    It is my understanding that there just isn\\'t much of a \\nknowledge that the veterans have, in terms of Active Duty \\npersonnel when they exit the military, about that particular \\noption. And so it is in law, but it is dramatically \\nunderutilized.\\n    Mr. Randazzo. Are you talking about the last 6 months of \\ntheir service where they can do a job apprentice or job shadow?\\n    Mr. Coffman. No. When they actually go through the out-\\nbriefings, that it is available to them under the Veterans \\nAdministration. It is my understanding that the soldiers, \\nmarines, airmen, and sailors are really not made aware of that \\nparticular opportunity.\\n    Mr. Randazzo. Yeah, so I am aware of a program for the last \\n6 months of their service.\\n    Mr. Coffman. Right, yeah.\\n    Mr. Randazzo. They are allowed to do a program, and maybe \\nyou are not aware of it, but----\\n    Mr. Coffman. No, I am aware of that program.\\n    Mr. Randazzo. Gotcha.\\n    Mr. Coffman. This is after they leave Active Duty.\\n    Dr. Heck. That might be a question better suited for the \\nsecond panel.\\n    Mr. Coffman. Okay.\\n    Mr. Randazzo. But I think that program, sir, is one of the \\nbest programs that the military could offer in the VA or the \\nDOL [Department of Labor] can offer is a job shadow and \\napprentice. I think that should be emphasized more.\\n    And I think some of the rules should be laxed on that. It \\nis a 50-mile radius. So, for example, Fort Hood is 61 miles \\nfrom Austin, Texas. I mean, there is a lot of growth and \\nopportunities in Austin, Texas. JBLM [Joint Base Lewis-McChord] \\nto St. Louis--to Seattle, same thing. Fort Bragg, which I was \\njust at, to Raleigh that is just outside of that mile radius.\\n    So I think there are some things that could be tweaked in \\nthat to make it better.\\n    Mr. Coffman. Okay.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Dr. Heck. We will go around with a second round.\\n    Mr. Mahoney, I would imagine that, based on the success \\nthat your program has had, there would be other communities \\ninterested in trying to replicate what you have done and not \\nrecreate the wheel. Could you discuss any specific challenges \\nyou had in establishing your program and how you overcame those \\nchallenges?\\n    What I find often is that, when there is a community \\norganization or a not-for-profit or somebody who is trying to \\ngain access to a base to provide a service, that is usually one \\nof the biggest obstacles that they have to overcome. Did you \\nface that same thing? And if so, how did you overcome that and, \\nas well, any other challenges that you might have had?\\n    Mr. Mahoney. Yes, Mr. Chairman. We had the Navy on our ops \\ncommittee, which is really the planning committee, and the \\nleadership and oversight committee from the start. So we were \\nfortunate that Admiral Dixon Smith, who is now the chief of \\nNaval Installations Command, was the regional commander--very \\ninterested in transition and was participating in some of those \\nmeetings. So he was engaged from the start. We also had a \\nrepresentative from Marine Corps Recruit Depot on our \\ncommittee, as well, so that helped.\\n    But it still, even with that level of engagement, it still \\ntook about 9 months to get the memorandum of understanding \\nthrough the legal staff at the region. So that was challenging. \\nWe were very pleased that it did get through and did get \\napproved.\\n    I know that one of the concerns is, if you let one \\norganization on base, then you are letting thousands, perhaps, \\non base. And one of the things that we tried to explain is that \\nwe are really a neutral connector; we are connecting people to \\nresources. We are not going to duplicate what many of the other \\ngreat organizations are doing in San Diego. And I know that had \\nto be sort of socialized with the nonprofits and the other \\nagencies in San Diego. We were happy to have the VA on our \\nboard, as well. And I think that helped us get past some of \\nthose challenges.\\n    Dr. Heck. Thank you.\\n    Mrs. Davis.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Thank you.\\n    I am wondering about scaling up. You know, every time we \\nhave a really great pilot doing something that works, we often \\nwant to take that to another level. And sometimes the \\nconditions, the personalities, the demographics, what have you, \\nthat there is something that is different enough and it doesn\\'t \\nwork.\\n    What are some of the thoughts that you have about your \\nprograms? We are going to talk, the next panel, about the \\nrelationship with the DOD, and so I know that you don\\'t \\nnecessarily want to get into that. But do you have an interest \\nin that? And what do you see as some of the ways that you would \\ngo about doing that? What do you need from the Congress or, you \\nknow, from the Department?\\n    Mr. Randazzo. So, yes, so, definitely, we do want to scale. \\nAnd so online and technology gives us the option to do that. So \\nwe have an app that we have developed, a transition app, and we \\nare coming out with another version here in the next 90 days. \\nWe also have online programming that will feed them in a good \\nsequence of order of different techniques and strategies; as \\nwell as we have over 140 TED-type videos online that we can \\nsequence to them, along with workable, actionable steps they \\ncan take after watching and take action.\\n    So, yes, we definitely would like to scale, but we need to \\nactivate this 18 months prior to them leaving. And I had a \\ngreat conversation before. It should even be maybe 3 or 4 or 5 \\nyears before they transition out, some of these things. And we \\nhave almost developed a more of a leadership-type role summit \\nversus a transition, and that is from some of the CGs that we \\nhave dealt with and that have sat in our program for 2 or 3 \\ndays.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Uh-huh.\\n    Mr. Mann. If I could just offer one thing to that, it is \\nunderstanding that, as a former Army officer, going deeper into \\nthe life pattern of the service member, that is harder because \\nyou have a war to fight, you know, you have to retain numbers, \\nand you have to do the mission. And that becomes very hard when \\nyou are trying to train and deploy.\\n    So one of the things I might suggest, too, in the private-\\npublic partnership realm is some kind of collaborative council \\nthat meets with entrepreneurs and leaders and military \\nleadership and even military personnel serving at the lower \\nlevels, to come together and find ways to do that, because \\nthere are ways.\\n    I built my real estate portfolio still on Active Duty \\nserving in a special forces group. A lot of it was offline work \\nthat I had to do in my own time, but the point is there are \\nways that this stuff can be provided that isn\\'t necessarily \\nintrusive into the daily military cycle.\\n    But a collaborative forum to do that, you know, it is not \\ngoing to be sorted out here. It is going to take some time and \\nthe right people in the room.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Uh-huh.\\n    Mr. Randazzo. Ma\\'am, I will just say that we would like to \\nexpand access to our program. We are growing to meet the large \\ndemand that we are seeing already. We would like to expand to \\nCamp Pendleton this year.\\n    USD [University of San Diego], as part of their evaluation, \\nthe third-party evaluation of the outcomes, is also documenting \\nhow the program was rolled out so it could be potentially \\nreplicated in other communities.\\n    And as far as what could be done by government, grant \\nprograms would be helpful. If there are grants that we could \\npursue for community-based handoffs from the transition \\ncourses, that would be terrific. And, also, we would be \\npursuing those kind of grants through county and more local \\ngovernment, as well.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Uh-huh. Great.\\n    Thank you.\\n    Dr. Heck. Ms. Tsongas.\\n    Ms. Tsongas. Thank you all again.\\n    So, as veterans are seeking you all out for one reason or \\nanother, I am curious what they are telling you about what has \\nbeen most effective with regard to the transition services that \\nthey have been offered through the DOD and where are there \\nshortfalls.\\n    If we could start with you, Mr. Mahoney.\\n    Mr. Mahoney. I think, from my perspective, the transition \\nclasses on base are effective if the--you basically get what \\nyou put into those courses. If the service member goes there \\nand is participating and they are anxious to learn and they are \\ngoing to leave there and make progress with their future, that \\ncan be effective for them. It won\\'t be effective for them if \\nthey are in the class and not paying attention and focused on \\nother things.\\n    So we have seen that. It is frustrating that there are \\nthings that are available for them that can be effective that, \\nin some cases, they don\\'t take advantage of.\\n    I think the courses on base also that are directed towards \\neducation and other specific areas, we refer them back to the \\nbase for those courses, and they can be effective, as well.\\n    Ms. Tsongas. Do you hear why there might be some who don\\'t \\ntake advantage of it? Do you see a reason why some are more \\nlikely to do it and others not?\\n    Mr. Mahoney. I would say, ma\\'am, that it is a little bit of \\ncomplacency. There might be overconfidence in how marketable \\ntheir skills will be when they get out of the service. They may \\nnot have a realistic expectation of, say, their salary range or \\nhow long it will take and how much effort it is going to take \\nto get employment.\\n    Ms. Tsongas. Okay.\\n    Mr. Mann.\\n    Mr. Mann. Just a little different twist to that. The folks \\nthat I have talked to, they are sprinting all the way to the \\nfinish line. They still have dust on their boots, and they \\ndon\\'t have a lot of time to really process the notion of \\ntransition. And so, you know, it is a mindset. And it is more \\nthan just the TAP program. It is getting yourself ready for \\nthat.\\n    And so, in many cases, they are going into transition \\nhaving just come off deployments, having just come off training \\nmissions. And what I hear often is just frustration that \\ntransition happened so quickly and there just wasn\\'t time to \\nprepare. And then they find themselves, you know, in a brand-\\nnew world, trying to figure it out.\\n    Ms. Tsongas. So it is more a timing issue?\\n    Mr. Mann. Operational tempo and timing, I think.\\n    Ms. Tsongas. Okay.\\n    Mr. Randazzo.\\n    Mr. Randazzo. I would add, I think it is also a delivery \\nissue. I understand--I have not sat through a class. I have \\nfinally been invited to sit through a class. I am going to sit \\nthrough one at Fort Bragg. But I understand there are hundreds \\nof PowerPoints throughout a 5-day period. And a 26-year-old \\nsoldier who might be transitioning out, a marine, may not--that \\nmight not be engaging to them. So I think more interaction, I \\nthink more technology tools.\\n    And the manuals they receive, I mean, it is 15 pounds of \\nmanuals. I am not sure if printing those are super-effective. I \\nthink you can provide those digitally.\\n    But I think there needs to be more engagement. The one \\nthing that I have heard is that the people who deliver this, \\nthey are rushing through slides. And I have heard from about a \\ndozen people who are going through it right now, it is, ``Hey, \\nlet\\'s get through these last 45 slides, and let\\'s work through \\nlunch, and we\\'ll get you guys out of here by 2:30.\\'\\' And so I \\ndon\\'t think that is the message that soldiers need to hear.\\n    Ms. Tsongas. Thank you.\\n    Thank you. I yield back.\\n    Dr. Heck. Mr. Knight, followup? No?\\n    Mr. Coffman, followup?\\n    Mr. Coffman. No.\\n    Dr. Heck. Okay.\\n    Well, again, I want to thank all of you for coming here \\ntoday and showing us the value of the public-private \\npartnership and some of the challenges and obstacles you may \\nhave faced in bringing your programs to camps, posts, bases, \\nand how we can further help you as, you know, some of the \\npremiere models out there expand across the Nation and provide \\nmore of these services to more of our transitioning troops. We \\nappreciate your time and your testimony today.\\n    And we will break and allow the flip of the panels, and \\nthen we will move into the next panel quickly.\\n    [Recess.]\\n    Dr. Heck. Okay. I would like to welcome our second panel to \\nthe dais.\\n    We have with us Dr. Susan Kelly, Director of Transition to \\nVeterans Program Office in the Office of the Secretary of \\nDefense; Major General Burke Whitman, Director of Marine and \\nFamily Programs Division, U.S. Marine Corps; Brigadier General \\nJames Iacocca, Adjutant General of the U.S. Army; Mr. Thomas \\nYavorski, Executive Director of the 21st Century Sailor Office, \\nrepresenting the Navy; and Mr. Horace Larry, Deputy Chief of \\nStaff, Manpower and Personnel, for the U.S. Air Force.\\n    Again, I would remind the witnesses, if you can, to please \\nsummarize your testimony to 3 minutes to your best of your \\nability so we can get into the questions.\\n    And, with that, I will recognize Dr. Kelly.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF DR. SUSAN KELLY, DIRECTOR, TRANSITION TO VETERANS \\n       PROGRAM OFFICE, OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE\\n\\n    Dr. Kelly. Good afternoon, Chairman Heck, Ranking Member \\nDavis, distinguished members of the subcommittee. I appreciate \\nthe opportunity to provide you an update on the Transition \\nAssistance Program, TAP, and our united effort to support our \\ntransitioning service members.\\n    Since the last time I testified before this subcommittee, \\nthe Department has fully implemented a redesigned TAP at 206 \\nsites worldwide. There were four core components to this \\nredesign: adopt Career Readiness Standards, CRS, which measures \\na service member\\'s preparedness to depart from Active Duty; \\ndevelop Transition GPS, a curriculum that builds the skills \\nneeded by service members to meet the CRS; a Capstone event, \\nduring which commanders verify their members have met Career \\nReadiness Standards or, if not, ensure that they receive \\nadditional training or a warm handover; and implementation to \\nthe military lifecycle transition model, which aligns \\ntransition activities with touchpoints across the military \\ncareer.\\n    We have accomplished these core objectives, and the results \\nare clear. The most recent participant assessment data show \\nover 80 percent of respondents saying they gained valuable \\ninformation and skills to plan their transition, that the \\ntraining enhanced their confidence in their transition, they \\nintended to use what they learned in the classes, and that they \\nknew how to access appropriate resources post-separation.\\n    Between October 2014 and August of 2015, over 150,000 \\nservice members separated from Active Duty. Based on data \\nverified by the Defense Manpower Data Center, 94 percent of \\nthese eligible members met the VOW [Veteran Opportunity to \\nWork] Act mandate. Eighty-eight percent either met Career \\nReadiness Standards or received a warm handover.\\n    These results indicate the commitment of the services and \\nour partners to prepare members for civilian life. These \\npartners include the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Labor, \\nand Education, the Small Business Administration, and the \\nOffice of Personnel Management.\\n    This cooperation has been institutionalized through the TAP \\ninteragency governance structure, consisting of an assistant-\\nsecretary-level executive council and the SES [Senior Executive \\nService] and SES senior steering group. These bodies assess and \\nmodify TAP. And the services are fully engaged with the \\ngovernance to influence the continued improvement of TAP.\\n    Over the past 2 years, private and public organizations, as \\nyou have heard, companies, and Federal agencies have recognized \\nthat service members present an incredible pool of talent, and \\nthey seek increased opportunities to harness that talent. In \\ncollaboration with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\\'s foundation \\nHiring Our Heroes, we have helped shape the environment in \\nwhich employers gain early access to transitioning service \\nmembers and their spouses.\\n    In 2015, thousands of members attended 18 large-scale \\ntransition summits at installations in both the U.S. and \\noverseas. The Departments of Energy, Agriculture, and Homeland \\nSecurity are actively engaged in targeting service members for \\nindustry jobs.\\n    And through the SkillBridge authority, under the Office of \\nthe Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness, a growing \\nnumber of members have developed skills for employment in high-\\ndemand industries.\\n    My colleagues from the services can share more about the \\nprograms implemented at their installations.\\n    There has been tremendous forward movement, but we must \\ncontinue to work with Federal partners and the private sector \\nto gather lessons learned, improve the curriculum, instill a \\nculture of planning for post-military life, and developing \\npipelines into the national workforce.\\n    That concludes my statement. I will be happy to take your \\nquestions.\\n    [The prepared statement of Dr. Kelly can be found in the \\nAppendix on page 60.]\\n    Dr. Heck. General Whitman.\\n\\n STATEMENT OF MAJGEN BURKE WHITMAN, USMC, DIRECTOR, MARINE AND \\n          FAMILY PROGRAMS DIVISION, U.S. MARINE CORPS\\n\\n    General Whitman. Chairman Heck, Ranking Member Davis, \\ndistinguished members, on behalf of the Marine Corps, I am \\ngrateful for the opportunity to give you an update on our \\nTransition Readiness Program.\\n    We call it ``transition readiness\\'\\' rather than \\n``transition assistance\\'\\' because it is an essential component \\nof the overall readiness of our individual marines and their \\nfamilies.\\n    We transition 30,000 marines out of the Marine Corps ever \\nyear. Your marines are fighters. They are mostly young, and \\nmost plan to separate after just one or two tours, maybe 4 to 8 \\nyears of Active Duty service. So we don\\'t wait until the end of \\ntheir service to begin building their transition readiness. We \\nbegin shortly after the marine enters the Corps and continue \\nthroughout and even beyond the uniformed career.\\n    We use a framework that we call the Marine for Life Cycle. \\nThere are three action points in that cycle--eight action \\npoints, excuse me, in that cycle. And at three of those, we \\nrequire some specific activities to build transition readiness.\\n    The first of these mandatory action points occurs when the \\nmarine arrives at the first permanent duty station, which is \\nafter boot camp, after follow-on combat training, and after \\ntheir military occupational specialty school. Upon welcome \\naboard at that duty station, they attend our Personal Readiness \\nSeminar, which is required at that point. This establishes the \\nfoundation for the marine\\'s journey through the Corps and \\nhighlights the available services throughout the Marine for \\nLife Cycle, to include transition readiness, individual \\ndevelopment plans, transition plans, and that kind of thing.\\n    The second mandatory action point occurs at promotion. \\nBefore a marine gets promoted to corporal, she or he has to \\ntake a course we call Your Readiness. This provides them an \\nupdate review of the services and resources available to them \\nand the development of her or his individual transition plan.\\n    And then the final mandatory action point occurs as the \\nmarine approaches separation and attends the Transition \\nReadiness Seminar that Dr. Kelly talked about.\\n    At the end of this is the Capstone, which, in our case, is \\nan exit interview with the commander or designee to ensure \\nreadiness. That is a key moment. Transition Readiness is a \\ncommander\\'s program, and we treat it as a commander\\'s \\nresponsibility to make sure that the marine is ready or, \\ninstead, to conduct a warm handover.\\n    In addition to these mandatory components, we do have the \\nthree track options for higher education, entrepreneurship, or \\ncareer technical training. We also have a number of workshops, \\nseminars, apprenticeship programs, and others that we may talk \\nabout during the questions.\\n    Also, after departure, a marine is forever a member of \\nMarine for Life Network, which is an organized element of our \\nMarine for Life Cycle led by marines who maintain networks of \\njob opportunities.\\n    One quick example that I will close with. Major Kyle \\nAldrich, our Marine for Life representative in one particular \\ngeographical area, maintained a long-term active communication \\nwith a corporation that might someday hire. And, at one point, \\nthat person, his contact there, called him, said, ``We\\'ve got a \\njob opening. It\\'s a hot fill.\\'\\' The major immediately gave him \\nthe resume of a transitioning marine, and that marine just \\nrecently got the job.\\n    As the area\\'s Marine for Life representative, as part of \\nthat network, Major Aldrich\\'s duty was to stay on top of those \\nopportunities. That was his mission, and that is what he did.\\n    We have a lot more to do, and we are working with the \\nDepartment and the other services to try to improve our \\nprogram, as well. And I look forward to answering your \\nquestions about that. Thank you very much.\\n    [The prepared statement of General Whitman can be found in \\nthe Appendix on page 73.]\\n    Dr. Heck. General Iacocca.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF BG JAMES IACOCCA, USA, ADJUTANT GENERAL, U.S. ARMY\\n\\n    General Iacocca. Chairman Heck, Ranking Member Davis, and \\ndistinguished members of this committee, thank you for the \\nopportunity to appear before you on behalf of America\\'s Army.\\n    The United States Army is committed to ensuring the \\nlifelong success of our soldiers as they transition to citizens \\nand veterans in civilian society. Our responsibility is to \\ninspire soldiers for life by providing essential counseling and \\ntraining throughout a soldier\\'s career to ensure they are ready \\nto succeed when they leave Active Duty.\\n    The Army\\'s Soldier for Life-Transition Assistance Program \\nis a commander\\'s program. The program facilitates a soldier\\'s \\ntransition by ensuring they begin the process early and they \\nvisit the transition center often and ensures commanders \\nprovide encouragement and adequate time for soldiers to \\ncomplete transition activities.\\n    Today, the Soldier for Life-Transition Assistance Program \\nserves approximately 110,000 soldiers annually. The program \\nprovides soldiers with the counseling, employment and education \\nworkshops, career tracks, and career skill opportunities \\nrequired to achieve the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011, \\ncommonly known as the VOW Act, and OSD [Office of the Secretary \\nof Defense] policies. As a result, the program helps soldiers \\nmake informed career decisions, be competitive in the \\nworkforce, and continue to provide positive contributions to \\ntheir community after completing their Active Duty service.\\n    Currently, the Army is meeting the requirements of the VOW \\nAct, with the Active Component at 89 percent, the National \\nGuard at 75 percent, and the Army Reserve at 79 percent for \\nfiscal year 2015.\\n    In the last 5 years, we have increased our investment in \\nthe Soldier for Life-Transition Assistance Program and have \\ngrown from 54 to 75 centers worldwide and increased transition, \\nfinancial, and educational counselors by 475 personnel, to a \\ntotal of 700 counselors and staff.\\n    Additionally, the Army established mobile training teams to \\nsupport the National Guard and Army Reserve at home and at \\ndemobilization stations. To expand our reach, the Army created \\na 24/7 Virtual Soldier for Life-Transition Assistance Center to \\nmeet the needs of all soldiers, including those deployed in \\nIraq and Afghanistan. And we have TAP 21, an automated system \\nthat allows commanders to maintain visibility throughout the \\nprocess.\\n    Focusing on expanding soldiers\\' career options, the Army\\'s \\nCareer Skills Program affords transitioning soldiers the \\nopportunity to obtain industry-recognized credentials and to \\nparticipate in first-class apprenticeships, on-the-job \\ntraining, job shadowing, internships, and employment skills \\ntraining up to 100 days prior to separation.\\n    One of those programs is the United Association of Veterans \\nin Piping, which provides internships in pipe welding and \\nheating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The program has a \\n98 percent retention rate, and more than 1,100 soldiers have \\nreceived jobs through this program.\\n    To conclude, I wish to thank all of you for your continued \\nsupport. The Army is committed to being a leader of the \\nDepartment of Defense transition efforts by preparing and \\nconnecting our soldiers and our veterans to career and \\neducation opportunities.\\n    Chairman Heck and Ranking Member Davis and members of the \\nsubcommittee, I thank you again for the opportunity to appear \\nbefore you.\\n    [The prepared statement of General Iacocca can be found in \\nthe Appendix on page 82.]\\n    Dr. Heck. Mr. Yavorski.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF THOMAS YAVORSKI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 21ST CENTURY \\n                    SAILOR OFFICE, U.S. NAVY\\n\\n    Mr. Yavorski. Chairman Heck, Ranking Member Davis, and \\ndistinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the \\nopportunity to update you on Navy\\'s Transition Assistance \\nProgram.\\n    Nearly 4 years ago, the Veteran Employment Initiative Task \\nForce was formed to develop and improve the Transition \\nAssistance Program and the Transition GPS, or Goals, Plan, \\nSuccess, curriculum. We implemented Transition GPS throughout \\nthe Navy in 2012 through 2014. We have also continued to \\nimprove classroom delivery by updating Transition GPS software, \\nenhancing the WiFi capability for computers in every classroom, \\nexpanding our delivery approach to accommodate sailors in \\nisolated locations, and adding classroom capacity.\\n    Sailors leaving the Navy today have a far better transition \\nexperience than was previously available. They have far greater \\ninsight into the quality veteran benefits they have earned in \\nrecognition of their service. As part of the interagency \\ntransition assistance governance structure, the Navy continues \\nto meet with the Defense Transition to Veterans Program Office, \\nother service representatives, and our interagency partners to \\ncontinuously assess and improve Transition GPS.\\n    The transition military life cycle incorporates career \\nreadiness and transition preparation across a sailor\\'s career, \\nrather than waiting until they are separating. Aspects of \\nTransition GPS are incorporated into the Navy Career \\nDevelopment Boards held at key points in the sailor\\'s career.\\n    Navy Credentialing Opportunities Online, or Navy COOL, \\nhelps sailors obtain civilian certifications and licenses for \\nskills acquired during their service. Since its inception in \\nOctober 2007, Navy COOL has provided over 130,000 \\ncertifications and licenses for over 41,000 sailors in every \\nenlisted rating and pay grade.\\n    Commanding officers are encouraged to authorize eligible \\nsailors to pursue employment skills training through the \\nDepartment of Defense SkillBridge initiative during their final \\n180 days of Active Duty. For example, the Navy is supporting \\nthe Solar Ready Vets pilot program in Norfolk in partnership \\nwith Tidewater Community College and the Department of Energy. \\nThe Navy continues to work with public and private \\norganizations like zero8hundred to provide sailors additional \\ntransition assistance opportunities.\\n    Each sailor who selflessly serves our Nation eventually \\nseparates or retires and, in doing so, has earned our \\nunwavering commitment to provide them the tools that will \\nposition them for success as they transition and continue \\nserving our Nation as honored and distinguished veterans.\\n    I thank you for your steadfast support for all Navy \\nsailors, and I look forward to your questions.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Yavorski can be found in the \\nAppendix on page 89.]\\n    Dr. Heck. Mr. Larry.\\n\\n    STATEMENT OF HORACE LARRY, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF AIR FORCE \\n  SERVICES, DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR MANPOWER AND PERSONNEL, \\n                  HEADQUARTERS U.S. AIR FORCE\\n\\n    Mr. Larry. Thank you, sir.\\n    Chairman Heck and distinguished members of this \\nsubcommittee, I am pleased to testify before you today \\nregarding transition assistance the Air Force provides to our \\nActive Duty, Guard, and Reserve members and their families.\\n    In 2012, we revamped our Transition Assistance Program with \\na major overhaul that embraced requirements outlined in the \\nVeterans Opportunity to Work to Hire Heroes Act and the \\nVeterans Employment Initiative. We executed a partnership with \\nthe staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, our fellow \\narmed services, the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Labor, and \\nEducation, as well as the Small Business Administration, and \\nthe Office of Personnel Management.\\n    Along the way, we teamed with industry leaders in \\norchestrating a type of revamped Transition Assistance Program \\nthat is delivering what our members need and want. Through our \\ncollaborative efforts, the Air Force has created a win-win \\nsituation where our airmen succeed as employees, students, or \\nbusiness owners and as productive members of the private sector \\nwhile in transition from military service.\\n    The Air Force is committed to furthering collaboration as \\nwe press forward in delivering the best transition assistance \\npossible for our members and families. Thank you for this \\nopportunity to testify before you, and I look forward to \\naddressing any questions you may have.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Larry can be found in the \\nAppendix on page 97.]\\n    Dr. Heck. Again, thank you all very much for coming and \\nparticipating today.\\n    Dr. Kelly, in your testimony, you mentioned a TAP \\ninteragency organization. So is there representation from the \\nprivate sector on that interagency group, such as entities like \\nzero8hundred or American Dream U?\\n    Dr. Kelly. The TAP interagency governance structure, both \\nthe executive council and the senior steering group, are made \\nup of the Federal agencies as well as the services.\\n    Dr. Heck. So, in your opinion, is there an opportunity or, \\nI mean, would there be a benefit to have representation from \\nthe private sector, especially those entities that are looking \\nto try to offer services to transitioning service members?\\n    Dr. Kelly. I think if you give the services the opportunity \\nto talk about all of their public-private partnerships that \\nthey are engaged in right now, you will find out that they are \\ngetting feedback from the program. But, also, I think we have \\nevolved from just providing a Transition GPS curriculum and \\nmeeting Career Readiness Standards. It has been a tremendous \\nlearning experience over the last couple of years.\\n    We were very much focused on unemployment of our veterans \\nand resolving that issue and working with employers to resolve \\nthat issue. What we have learned is that employers are now \\ncoming to us and saying, ``This is a real talent pool, and we \\nwant early access to that.\\'\\'\\n    But the other lesson that we have learned is that this is a \\ncommunity issue that is probably best addressed at the \\ncommunity level. You heard of the terrific success of \\nzero8hundred. He talked about using the 2-1-1 directory for the \\ncommunity resources that are in that community. He talked about \\nbringing in the employers, bringing in the installation \\ncommanders.\\n    So he mobilized or that entire community mobilized their \\ncommunity resources and looked at the needs of that community \\nand developed a solution. You see that going on in multiple \\nplaces, which some of the installations are part of. You see \\nthose kinds of communities coming together and saying, how are \\nwe going to use what we have to either keep these service \\nmembers here because they are a terrific talent pool for us, \\nyou see it going on in North Carolina, you see it going on in \\nWashington State, you see it going on in California. But what \\nis happening is that they are developing efforts to address the \\nworkforce skill gaps in those States and in those communities, \\nand that becomes more meaningful.\\n    Dr. Heck. So is there a process, a formal process, by which \\na program, let\\'s say, like zero8hundred that has done extremely \\nwell in the San Diego area, is evaluated for potential \\nimplementation or recommendation to be used in other locations? \\nI mean, if we find a private-sector program that seems to be \\nworking in one area, is there some formal process by which that \\nis looked at to see whether or not it can be implemented \\nelsewhere?\\n    Dr. Kelly. Well, the Secretary of Defense then at the time, \\nSecretary Hagel, provided guidance to the military departments, \\nthe Secretaries of the military departments, the Chiefs, and \\nthe Chairman and provided guidance, saying, look at allowing \\nnon-Federal entities onto the installations when they are \\nproviding support to our military members and our families.\\n    There was very explicit guidance and templates, actually, \\non how to evaluate those entities, but left to the installation \\ncommanders and those communities to evaluate those programs, \\nwhat was needed by the service members on those installations \\nand those families, and how that fit into the community. So \\nthat authority still is retained by each one of the \\ninstallation commanders.\\n    And as we see this evolving, it seems to be the community-\\nlevel efforts that have the most meaning. And if we look at it \\nin the long term, we can build that economic prosperity for our \\nStates and our communities using the workforce skills of our \\ntransitioning service members. And I think we have to figure \\nout and come to an agreement as to what are our long-term \\ngoals.\\n    Dr. Heck. Great.\\n    My second question will take longer than the 45 seconds I \\nhave left, so I will wait for the second round.\\n    Mrs. Davis.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Thank you very much.\\n    I actually wanted to ask all of you to just respond to \\nanything you heard in their presentations that could be \\nproblematic in terms of the services or what you would welcome.\\n    I think, Dr. Kelly, you are suggesting that having the \\ncommunity engaged in the activities is very, very valuable. But \\nI think it also raises some questions about the capacity of our \\nservices to respond and, I guess, to be able to spend some \\nvaluable time interacting with them, as well, in order to make \\nthat effort go further.\\n    How is that? What do you say to the organizations that are \\nworking hard in the communities? And does that say something \\nabout the fact that maybe you are not totally having a TAP \\nprogram that works for the service members, as well?\\n    Dr. Kelly. I am sorry, I am not quite clear on what the \\nquestion is.\\n    Mrs. Davis. I am just wondering about a reaction to what \\nyou heard and whether there are some instances in which perhaps \\nthey do get in the way, in some instances, or just the fact \\nthat you are trying to provide the authority for them to go on \\nbase becomes problematic in any community. How can they deal \\nwith that?\\n    Dr. Kelly. Go ahead.\\n    General Whitman. We do have to balance at each installation \\nthe opportunity. We are eager to have the engagements with \\npartners, even with hiring partners, to the greatest extent \\nthat we can. We have to balance that at times with safety \\nconcerns, security concerns, just installation capacity \\nconcerns, which may mean sometimes we might want to move \\nsomething off the base. It might not be quite as appealing.\\n    Each installation is different. That is why it has made \\nsense for us so far to let each installation determine how best \\nto manage that. At Camp Lejeune, which is not close to a big \\nurban area, we manage that pretty differently from the way we \\ndo at Camp Pendleton, California, which is very close to lots \\nof urban, big hiring organizations.\\n    And we also have to balance the goodness that comes from \\nentering into these partnerships with ensuring that we do it \\nlegally and also fairly, in a way that doesn\\'t give \\npreferential treatment to someone that someone else may not \\nlike.\\n    But we are doing it in a very robust fashion. You will hear \\nfrom all of us, we are partnering heavily in every one of the \\ninstallations, much more so than in the past.\\n    General Iacocca. Yes, ma\\'am. We, too, in the Army allow our \\ninstallation commanders flexibility in the program. And we do \\nhave to maintain balance of who we allow on post. But, in many \\ncases, as you heard, they have access to posts, and our \\nsoldiers are participating in their programs.\\n    But one of the things that we are working through is to \\nstress to our soldiers to go to transition early and often and \\nnot wait till they get to the end of their service when they \\nare close to transition. And that would allow more time.\\n    And many of our soldiers are starting to go earlier and go \\nmore often. And it makes the program easier to digest, rather \\nthan try to do it in a condensed 5-day program as they are \\ngetting ready to transition out.\\n    Thank you.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Right.\\n    And anything that is different? I mean, if you find that \\nyou can work well with these organizations, that is great.\\n    Mr. Yavorski. I would just like to address one of the \\nissues that one of the gentlemen brought up about the \\nPowerPoints, in that we recognize that. And that is why we put \\nthe computers in all the classrooms, the WiFi. It is \\ninteractive.\\n    They can bring their own computer in. We have computers for \\nall of those--we talked about social media and LinkedIn through \\nthe VA. And every service member veteran gets 1 year of premium \\nfree LinkedIn membership. So we are stressing that and teaching \\nthat in our classes. So we are taking that on board.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Great.\\n    Mr. Larry. In terms of access to the bases, we, the Air \\nForce, take a similar approach. It is a balancing act, it most \\ncertainly is, with the force protection and the requirements of \\nthe base, et cetera. But the other part of that, we do look at \\nopportunities to bring on specific agencies or organizations to \\nsee how they could team with us, as well. We don\\'t have an \\noverarching process where it says, here is where we go Air \\nForce-wide, but we leave it to the individual installations.\\n    So we take the GPS TAP program; here is where we start, \\nhere is how we have to finish, here are the outcomes we see. \\nBut within that, like at Eglin Base in Florida, look at the \\nBoeing Company, we bring them on and say, we have some \\nopportunities, and we will work with you. And we give the \\nmembers specifics, as opposed to the job search overall.\\n    So we do work to embrace the local communities in this \\nprocess.\\n    Mrs. Davis. Thank you.\\n    Just going back to the Marines very quickly, and you talked \\nabout being a Marine for Life. In the other services, do you \\nalso work with organizations that work with the service member \\nafter they get out, specifically in your service?\\n    General Iacocca. I think, in the Army, if there is an issue \\nwith transition, we do the warm handover with the VA or the \\nDepartment of Labor.\\n    Mrs. Davis. With the VA. Okay. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Yavorski. In the Navy, we don\\'t have a ``Sailor for \\nLife,\\'\\' but we have a lot of those programs in our Fleet and \\nFamily Service Center and a warm handover and so forth.\\n    Mr. Larry. Similar with the Air Force, we don\\'t have a \\ncodified program like the Marines, but we do the warm handover \\nand validate that is done.\\n    Dr. Heck. Mr. Coffman.\\n    Mr. Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Can you tell me about, in the transition phase, the \\nintegration with the Department of Veterans Affairs? To what \\nextent do they make themselves available, and how are they \\nintegrated into what you do?\\n    Dr. Kelly. The VA\\'s benefits briefings are a mandatory \\nbriefing. There are no exemptions for any of the service \\nmembers. So that is 6 hours of face-to-face time with the \\nbenefits briefers. And there are follow-on one-on-one \\nappointments after that.\\n    So you have VA benefits briefings as part of the mandatory \\nTransition GPS core curriculum. But VA also volunteered to \\nbuild a curriculum for the career technical training track for \\nthose service members who want to use their Post-9/11 GI Bill \\nto get certifications in the trades. And that course teaches \\nthem how to choose the best institution, get the most financial \\naid, choose the course of study, and sets them up well to apply \\nfor those particular institutions.\\n    So VA is very well integrated across the Transition GPS \\ncurriculum and on the installations.\\n    Mr. Coffman. To what extent when members, because a lot of \\nthe members that leave tend to be, probably, disproportionally \\njunior enlisted, junior officers. And so, to what extents are--\\nand a lot of them have an inactive requirement but have no \\nActive Reserve requirement.\\n    To what extent do their respective services try to sell \\nthem on continuing their military service in the Active \\nReserves and also potentially getting another--are there \\nopportunities to earn a different occupational specialty on \\ntheir way out the door through a Reserve school to fit a unit \\nrequirement in whatever geographic area they are relocating to?\\n    Dr. Kelly. Well, on the first point, one of the Career \\nReadiness Standards is to go through the interview with the \\nReserve recruiter.\\n    Mr. Coffman. Oh, great.\\n    Dr. Kelly. So that is mandatory. We are realistic, in that \\nwe want to keep the best. So that is a Career Readiness \\nStandard for all service members.\\n    In reference to MOSs, I will let the services speak to \\nthat.\\n    General Whitman. We do, we pursue that programmatic piece \\naggressively. And we do offer retraining in occupational skills \\nbased on the need at the time. We are constantly reassessing \\nthat, sometimes even with bonuses, to try to get the right \\npeople in the right place.\\n    General Iacocca. While in the transition phase, sir, there \\nis not an opportunity to train them on a new MOS, but they do \\nhave opportunities to participate in a career skills program to \\ngain new skills that they can use as they transition out of the \\nArmy.\\n    Mr. Coffman. No, that would make absolute sense. But so, in \\nother words, a lot of times you have Reserve units in their \\ngeographic area, there is not an MOS match with what they have, \\nsay, in the Army today and what that unit is in proximity to \\nwhere they are going to live, and so that would require an MOS \\nschool. And so is that available?\\n    General Iacocca. Yes, sir, that is available. Once they \\ntransition, if they go into a Reserve unit where there may be a \\nMOS mismatch at the time, they can go to school once they are \\nin that Reserve unit.\\n    Mr. Coffman. Okay, but let me phrase this differently. So \\nthey are in transition. They decide they do want to re-\\naffiliate to another unit. They are talked to by the Reserve \\nrecruiter. So are there orders cut for them when they are \\nleaving Active Duty to go to their school before they even \\nreport into the unit?\\n    Quite frankly, that was an offer made to me when I was \\nleaving the Marine Corps to the Marine Corps Reserves.\\n    General Iacocca. Sir, I will have to get back to you on \\nthat. I know that opportunity exists. I don\\'t know if it \\nhappens--I don\\'t know if they are issued their orders prior to \\nleaving. But I will get back to you on that, sir.\\n    [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix \\non page 107.]\\n    Dr. Heck. Mr. O\\'Rourke.\\n    Mr. O\\'Rourke. Thank you.\\n    And, Dr. Kelly, you may have covered this in your \\nintroductory remarks, and I am sorry I missed them. What is the \\ntotal budget for the Transition Assistance Program?\\n    Dr. Kelly. The Transition Assistance Program is not \\nactually a line item. The activities are spread throughout many \\nof the different activities within the military personnel \\nsystem.\\n    Mr. O\\'Rourke. Do we have an idea of what it costs us to \\nperform these activities?\\n    Dr. Kelly. We are currently going through the process of \\npublishing our DODI [Department of Defense Instruction] and \\npublishing that on the Federal Register. And it is in the \\nneighborhood of $100 million per year.\\n    Mr. O\\'Rourke. Okay.\\n    And then I know from reading some of the conclusions from \\nthe 2014 GAO [Government Accountability Office] report, there \\nis the recommendation that we do a better job of measuring the \\neffectiveness of the TAP program.\\n    Dr. Kelly. Yes.\\n    Mr. O\\'Rourke. What are the measures that we would look at? \\nVeterans\\' unemployment? Percentage who are connected with a job \\nwithin so many months? What are the things that you will \\nmeasure going forward?\\n    Dr. Kelly. We actually have a TAP evaluation strategy that \\nwas requested by OMB [Office of Management and Budget] and was \\napproved by OMB. It has three pieces to it.\\n    One is to make sure that the program is implemented that \\nmeets the law and policy. So we monitor VOW compliance as well \\nas Career Readiness Standards that are met by the service \\nmembers; also, customer satisfaction. And we monitor that \\nthrough the Participant Assessment Tool, an anonymous online \\ntool, and provide the results of that at the installation level \\nevery quarter, so even commanders can monitor that at their own \\ninstallation. And then, finally, looking at long-term outcomes.\\n    For DOD, our input into the evaluation is our VOW \\ncompliance and our Career Readiness Standards. Our partners on \\nthe other side of the DD 214 [military discharge document] are \\nlooking at long-term outcomes--for instance, for Veterans \\nAffairs, the use of the Post-9/11 GI bill, the successful use \\nof that; persistence rate, the numbers who are actually \\ncompleting courses; as well as a Small Business Administration \\nfor the entrepreneurship track, how many are still in business \\nat certain periods of time; and then for the Department of \\nLabor, also looking at unemployment.\\n    Mr. O\\'Rourke. So employment is part of that?\\n    Dr. Kelly. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. But we are in the \\nprocess of looking at even longer-term outcomes. And DOL is \\nlooking at a quasi-experimental design to look at some more \\nresults.\\n    Mr. O\\'Rourke. And did I understand that you are in the \\nplanning stage of defining those metrics? Or have you already \\npublished what those metrics will be and you are measuring and \\nyou will then publish the results the coming year?\\n    Dr. Kelly. We have identified some of the measures. With \\nsome of the measures, we are identifying or tracking \\nmilestones, because it takes time to put the data collection \\nprocess someplace, as well as the IT [information technology] \\ninfrastructure to capture the data, and to work through the PII \\n[personally identifiable information] issues of data-sharing.\\n    But we have milestones, and we are tracking those \\nmilestones. That is one of the purposes of the TAP interagency \\ngovernance structure. And that is looked at every quarter.\\n    Mr. O\\'Rourke. And my last question. I appreciate my \\ncolleague asking about your effectiveness in working with the \\nVA. I think one of the things that a separating service member \\nis counseled on is their eligibility for health benefits within \\nthe VA. Tell me what the consequences are of poor performance \\nwithin the VA on access to mental health.\\n    We have an especially acute situation in El Paso. And I am \\nhearing from recently separated service members who are living \\nwith PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder], for example, that \\ntheir inability to access health care, mental health care, is \\naffecting their ability to pursue employment or, you know, have \\na quality of life that perhaps many of us take for granted.\\n    Any thoughts on that?\\n    Dr. Kelly. Well, certainly, Veterans Affairs is given 6 \\nhours of face time with each transitioning service member to go \\nthrough the VA benefits briefing. That is a mandate. There are \\nno exemptions for that. That is tracked. That is one of the \\nmandatory attendance and mandatory Career Readiness Standards.\\n    But one of the basic tenets of the TAP redesign was to \\nensure that connectivity between the installation, wherever any \\nservice member is transitioning from, to the resources with VA, \\nalso the resources for DOL. So they are taught how to navigate \\nthe Web-based tools to identify the resources in their own \\ncommunities and to connect to those staff members in their own \\ncommunities to which they are relocating.\\n    Past their transition out of Active Duty, that would have \\nto be tracked by Veterans Affairs.\\n    Mr. O\\'Rourke. Thank you.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Dr. Heck. Thank you.\\n    Well, that bell signified the votes series, so we will \\nforgo a second round of questions. My second question I will \\nsubmit for the record.\\n    Again, I want to thank all the witnesses on both panels for \\ntaking the time to be here and for hanging with us through our \\nhour-long delay. I appreciate what you are doing for our \\nservice men and women as they prepare to take on their civilian \\nsecond careers.\\n    And until we see you at the next hearing, we will be \\nadjourned.\\n    [Whereupon, at 5:00 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]\\n\\n    \\n=======================================================================\\n\\n                            A P P E N D I X\\n\\n                            October 28, 2015\\n\\n      \\n=======================================================================\\n\\n\\n              PREPARED STATEMENTS SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD\\n\\n                            October 28, 2015\\n\\n=======================================================================\\n\\n            \\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] \\n\\n      \\n=======================================================================\\n\\n\\n              WITNESS RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS ASKED DURING\\n\\n                              THE HEARING\\n\\n                            October 28, 2015\\n\\n=======================================================================\\n    \\n\\n      \\n\\n             RESPONSE TO QUESTION SUBMITTED BY MR. COFFMAN\\n\\n    General Iacocca. Transitioning RA Soldiers do not get training or \\nschooling required for a new Reserve Component (RC) MOS or unit while \\nthey are still on active duty. If a Soldier transitions from active \\nduty and joins the Reserve Component (RC) and that Soldier has already \\nsigned into his or her RC unit, then the RC funds the training \\n(assuming it is a ``will-train\\'\\' position) after he/she transitions off \\nof active duty. In some cases that training happens immediately after \\nthe transition, and in other cases it may happen months post-\\ntransition. The exception to this norm is the 365 Pilot Training \\nProgram at Fort Hood. That pilot allows a Soldier to train in a new \\nmilitary occupational specialty prior to transitioning off of active \\nduty from the Regular Army. The Army Marketing and Research Group \\nfunded this pilot for Fiscal Year 2015. However, funds are still \\npending for Fiscal Year 2016. The program is on track to expand to Fort \\nBragg later this year pending the release of a third fragmentary order \\nand additional funds.   [See page 28.]\\n\\n      \\n=======================================================================\\n\\n\\n              QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MEMBERS POST HEARING\\n\\n                            October 28, 2015\\n\\n=======================================================================\\n\\n      \\n    \\n\\n                    QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. WALZ\\n\\n    Mr. Walz. It is encouraging to learn of the continued emphasis and \\non-going successful development of the Transition Assistance Program? \\nLooking forward, what additional assistance from Congress, if any, do \\nyou require in order to increase the effectiveness of the program?\\n    Dr. Kelly. The Department is very appreciative of the support \\nCongress, and this Committee in particular, has given to our \\ntransitioning Service members. We would appreciate your continued \\nsupport and assistance in directing your constituent Service members \\nto:\\n    <bullet>  register at an American Job Center and take advantage of \\nthe programs and services they provide regarding employment assistance;\\n    <bullet>  apply for VA benefits immediately, if they did not do so \\nprior to separation; and\\n    <bullet>  use their robust Post-9/11 G.I. Bill wisely.\\n    Congress can continue to support TAP by encouraging employers in \\nyour respective districts to take advantage of the job announcement, \\nskills training, and placement opportunities available to them at the \\nAmerican Job Centers in your state. The American Job Centers now have \\nmillions of dollars in funding to help employers develop new \\napprenticeships and skills training that are needed in the local \\neconomies. All jobs are local. The more employers engage with the local \\nAmerican Job Centers, the more Veterans can return to their local \\ncommunities and look forward to economic opportunity.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n                   QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. KNIGHT\\n    Mr. Knight. Do we have a system in place for ensuring every vet\\'s \\n``hand-off\\'\\' has succeeded 6, 12, 24 months down the road? How are \\nservice men and women ``tagged and tracked,\\'\\' so to speak, by TAP?\\n    Dr. Kelly. The Department of Defense\\'s authority and ability to \\ntrack a Service member ends once a Service member separates from the \\nmilitary. However, as members of the TAP interagency governance body, \\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Labor (DOL), \\nand the Small Business Administration are working on developing long-\\nterm outcome indicators/measures of TAP. The successful use of the \\nPost-9/11 G.I. Bill for completion of a college degree and the new \\nbusiness formation rate for those veterans interested in pursuing \\nentrepreneurship are two examples of ensuring long-term success. \\nAdditional long-term, outcome-oriented evaluations are in development \\nby the VA and DOL to further strengthen the interagency evaluation \\napproach and ensure that the TAP is continuously improved. For example, \\nVA intends to conduct a survey to veterans (post-transition) on the \\nvalue of the TAP. Due to the Department of Defense\\'s limited role after \\na Service member separates, our TAP interagency partners are better \\nsuited to provide additional data on the long-term effectiveness of \\nTAP.\\n    Mr. Knight. What percent of service men and women leaving the Armed \\nForces today who want jobs transition to jobs within 6 months? And \\nwithin a year?\\n    Dr. Kelly. The Department of Defense\\'s authority and ability to \\ntrack a Service member ends once a Service member separates from the \\nmilitary. Our Transition Assistance Program (TAP) interagency partners, \\nparticularly the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Labor, have \\nmechanisms in place and in development to assess such outcomes of \\nVeterans. In particular, the Department of Labor, through its National \\nLongitudinal Survey, is able to track the employment situation over \\ntime of some Veterans. Due to the Department of Defense\\'s limited role \\nafter separation, the Department of Labor may be better suited to \\nsupply this data.\\n    Mr. Knight. What letter grade, or qualitative assessment, would \\neach of the military branches give the TAP today? How much has TAP \\nimproved since 2011?\\n    General Whitman. Our qualitative assessment of TAP is that it is a \\nvital, useful tool for Marines; it has improved significantly since \\n2011. TAP continues to gain momentum as we move forward in the Marine \\nFor Life Cycle with increased interagency collaboration, an improved \\ngovernance process, and annual reviews and updates. Metrics have been \\nput in place to track its effectiveness. Working groups with \\ninteragency partners discuss challenges and implement improvements in \\nthe program. Through these efforts, we remain actively involved and \\ncommitted to ensuring Marines are successfully meeting in-service and \\npost-transition goals.\\n    Mr. Knight. What letter grade, or qualitative assessment, would \\neach of the military branches give the TAP today? How much has TAP \\nimproved since 2011?\\n    General Iacocca. VOW to Hire Heroes Act compliance through third \\nquarter Fiscal Year 2015 was 90% for Active Component. For this reason \\nthe Army overall correlates as an ``A-\\'\\' for executing Transition \\nAssistance Program (TAP) services, whereas Army was a ``B\\'\\' in Fiscal \\nYear 2014 with Active Component at 83% compliance.\\n    The Army is doing well and improving year after year meeting the \\nlaw and the additional White House components of TAP. In the last five \\nyears, the Army\\'s Soldier for Life-Transition Assistance Program (SFL-\\nTAP) has grown from 54 to 75 centers worldwide, and from 225 to 700 \\ntransition, financial, and education counselors and staff. The program \\nadded a center in Kuwait, and established mobile transition teams to \\nsupport the National Guard and Army Reserve at home and at \\ndemobilization stations. Additionally, the Army created a 24/7 Virtual \\nSFL-TAP Center to meet the needs of remotely located Soldiers, those \\ndeployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and for any Soldier that needed to \\nreceive transition services telephonically or virtually.\\n    Furthermore, the Army has improved Soldiers\\' opportunities to reach \\ntheir post-transition career and education goals by establishing a \\nCareer Skills Program. The Career Skills Program affords transitioning \\nSoldiers the opportunity to obtain industry-recognized credentials, the \\nopportunity to participate in first-class apprenticeships, on-the-job \\ntraining, job shadowing, and employment skills training up to 180 days \\nprior to transitioning from the Army.\\n    Finally, the Army is working to improve the accuracy of our TAP \\nassessments by increasing the quality and quantity of post-transition \\nfeedback from our partnering agencies of the Departments of Veterans \\nAffairs and Labor, and the Internal Revenue Service.\\n    Mr. Knight. What letter grade, or qualitative assessment, would \\neach of the military branches give the TAP today? How much has TAP \\nimproved since 2011?\\n    Mr. Yavorski. I would give the Navy Transition Assistance Program \\n(TAP) a grade of B+, and improving. Sailor feedback reflects that 86 \\npercent agreed, or strongly agreed, that TAP was beneficial in helping \\nthem gain the information and skills to better plan for transition. \\nSince 2011, the program has greatly improved as a result of:\\n    <bullet>  revising the core transition assistance curriculum and \\nincreasing the length from four days to five days;\\n    <bullet>  adopting career readiness standards upon which the new \\ncurriculum is based;\\n    <bullet>  adding two-day tracks on assessing higher education, \\ncareer technical training, and entrepreneurship. (Sailors can also take \\nthe Small Business Administration advanced entrepreneurial workshop);\\n    <bullet>  adding a capstone event to ensure Sailors meet career \\nreadiness standards, or are provided a warm handoff to partner \\nagencies;\\n    <bullet>  incorporating the transition Military Life Cycle into our \\nexisting career development program to prepare Sailors for eventual \\ntransition throughout their military career;\\n    <bullet>  offering Sailors the opportunity to pursue employment \\nskills training during the last 180 days of active duty.\\n    <bullet>  updating curriculum software, enhancing WiFi capability, \\nand adding 2,493 new computers to facilitate an interactive classroom \\nenvironment; and\\n    <bullet>  improving access to classroom curriculum for remote \\noverseas locations.\\n    We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of Navy TAP with an \\neye towards opportunities for additional program enhancements based on \\nsharing lessons learned from the current program across the Department \\nof Defense.\\n    Mr. Knight. What letter grade, or qualitative assessment, would \\neach of the military branches give the TAP today? How much has TAP \\nimproved since 2011?\\n    Mr. Larry. The Air Force believes an ``A\\'\\' should be awarded to \\ntoday\\'s TAP. Since 2011, the Air Force has been sharply focused on the \\nredesigned Transition Assistance Program (TAP) to support Airmen as \\nthey transition back to civilian life. The Air Force prepares our \\nAirmen for transition in partnership with the Department of Labor, \\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, Office of Personnel Management, \\nDepartment of Education and the Small Business Administration. \\nCollectively, these partners provide services or support for delivering \\na purposeful Transition Assistance Program that helps ensure \\ntransitioning Airmen are ready for the next steps in civilian life--\\nwhether as a full-time student, employee and/or business owner--to help \\nthem in having successful careers. The Air Force remains committed to \\nensuring Airmen, as they depart military service, are ready for the \\nchallenges and rewards of civilian life and we extend a great deal of \\ngratitude to our private sector partners.\\n\\n                                  [all]\\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body></html>\\n'}, 'CHRG-114shrg20336': {'raw_text': '<html>\\n<title> - DEAD END, NO TURN AROUND, DANGER AHEAD: CHALLENGES TO THE FUTURE OF HIGHWAY FUNDING</title>\\n<body><pre>[Senate Hearing 114-276]\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                        S.

HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM \\n              UTAH, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE\\n\\n    The Chairman. The committee will come to order. Before we \\nbegin the hearing, I just want to take a moment to express my \\nsorrow for the horrific events that took place last night in \\nCharleston, SC. I am sure that those sentiments are shared by \\neveryone on the committee and everyone here. I have no words to \\nexpress that would adequately address the senseless violence \\nand loss of life. I simply ask that everyone join me in a \\nmoment of silence so that we can offer our thoughts and prayers \\nto the victims and their loved ones.\\n    [Moment of silence.]\\n    The Chairman. Thank you.\\n    Well, good morning, everyone. Today we will be discussing \\nthe challenges Congress faces as we work to provide funding for \\nthe Federal Highway Trust Fund. Right now, when it comes to \\nhighways, we find ourselves caught in a familiar dilemma \\nbetween raising taxes or cutting back on the highway program. \\nAs always, a long-term, bipartisan solution to this dilemma \\nwill be difficult to achieve, and, some days, it almost seems \\nout of reach. However, in the past, this committee has \\nconsistently stepped up to the plate to find ways to keep the \\nHighway Trust Fund solvent. I am confident that we can do so \\nagain.\\n    I want to make it clear at the outset that my goal as \\nchairman of this committee is to find a way to fund a long-term \\ninfrastructure bill. Chairman Ryan over in the House said much \\nthe same thing in yesterday\\'s Ways and Means Committee hearing. \\nAnd, while some friends on the other side of the aisle have \\nsuggested that it would be politically advantageous to force \\nvotes on a series of very short-term extensions, virtually \\neveryone in Congress agrees that we need to get to the point \\nwhere we are no longer facing a highway cliff every few months.\\n    We have all heard that the gold standard for a long-term \\nhighway bill is 6 years. That is what everyone apparently wants \\nto see happen. Of course, according to CBO, a 6-year highway \\nbill that maintains the current spending baseline will cost \\nroughly $92 to $94 billion. You do not find that kind of money \\nby sifting through the cushions on your couch. It is going to \\ntake hard work and real policy changes to get us anywhere near \\nthat level of funding. And, once again, that is if we maintain \\ncurrent spending levels. I know that some of my colleagues \\nbelieve we should raise the spending baseline at the same time, \\nwhich would put even more pressure on highway funding and \\nrequire us to find even more offsets to keep the trust fund \\nsolvent.\\n    Long story short, a 6-year highway bill is a great goal. I \\nam committed to working to get us as close to that goal as \\npossible.\\n    Earlier this week, some of the leaders in the Senate \\nDemocratic Caucus sent a letter to the Senate Majority Leader \\nspelling out a list of demands for enacting a long-term surface \\ntransportation reauthorization bill. The letter purported to \\ndictate to Senate Republicans precisely when hearings should \\noccur in the various committees, when those committees should \\nhold their markups, and when the final bill should come to the \\nfloor.\\n    Of course, any specific proposals or ideas on how to fund a \\nlong-term highway bill were noticeably absent from the letter. \\nInstead, we were treated to a discourse on how previous \\nCongresses had dealt with highway funding and how the current \\nSenate leadership is, in the eyes of some of the Senate \\nDemocrats, falling short.\\n    I do not want to spend too much time deconstructing this \\nletter, but I would like to point out a few simple facts. First \\nof all, neither party should point fingers and try to lay blame \\nwhen it comes to the now-common practice of passing short-term \\nhighway extensions. Between the 110th and 113th Congresses, \\nwhen the Democrats controlled the Senate, we enacted 11 short-\\nterm highway extensions. That does not include the 2012 MAP-21 \\nlegislation, which, according to the Senate Democrats\\' letter, \\nwas the paragon for how Congress should consider and pass a \\nlong-term extension of highway funding. Of course, MAP-21 \\nextended highway funding for only 2 years, far short of the \\ngoals that are being cited in Congress these days.\\n    As I recall, during that same period, when Republicans were \\nin the minority, we did not turn the struggles over highway \\nfunding into a political football. In fact, we approached these \\nnegotiations in a spirit of cooperation as much as possible. We \\ncame to the table with specific and concrete proposals that \\nincluded both revenue and spending options.\\n    Now, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated December \\n2, 2011, from Finance Committee Republicans to then-Chairman \\nBaucus be inserted in the record, and I will do that.\\n    [The letter appears in the appendix on p. 41.]\\n    The Chairman. This letter did not dictate a path forward to \\nChairman Baucus. Instead, it spelled out in detail policy \\nproposals that Republicans could support to address an imminent \\nshortfall in highway funding. This was a constructive \\ncontribution to the debate over legislation that eventually \\nbecame MAP-21, which was, once again, recently cited by our \\nfriends on the other side of the aisle as important. MAP-21 was \\nthe product of bipartisan work on the Finance Committee and was \\nevenly split between taxpayer-friendly revenue raisers and \\nspending reductions.\\n    For example, it was Republicans who first advanced the idea \\nof transferring unobligated funds from the Leaking Underground \\nStorage Tank Trust to help pay for highways. Now, whatever one \\nmay think of this particular pay-for, it has become a go-to \\nrevenue source in recent highway bills, including the last two \\nhighway bills enacted under the Democrat-controlled Senate. \\nAnd, by contrast, one of the very few specific highway funding \\nproposals I have seen from any of the signatories of this \\nweek\\'s letter is the so-called repatriation holiday, which, \\naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, actually loses \\nnearly $120 billion over 10 years. In other words, it is not a \\nserious proposal to pay for a long-term highway bill.\\n    Put simply, the rhetoric we are hearing from many of my \\nfriends on the other side of the aisle--which was exemplified \\nby the letter they sent earlier this week--is not really \\nhelpful. It is not constructive. It is, I suspect, intended to \\nhave a political impact, not to actually lead to good policy. \\nNow, to this point, I will request that an article from the \\nJune 3, 2015, edition of Politico be entered into the record.\\n    [The article appears in the appendix on p. 43.]\\n    The Chairman. This article, titled ``Democrats Steer \\nTowards Highway Funding Cliff,\\'\\' basically spells out the \\npolitical strategy being employed here and even quotes members \\nof the Senate Democratic leadership saying that they plan to \\nforce frequent votes on highway funding to make the process as \\npolitically difficult as possible.\\n    Now, if we are going to address these challenges, we need \\npeople to set aside the politics. We need people to do more \\nthan just talk about a long-term highway bill. We need people \\nto bring actual ideas to the table and to come together to work \\ntoward a real, lasting solution. I hope that is what we can \\ntalk about during today\\'s hearing. I hope we can have a \\nproductive conversation about what solutions are out there, \\nwhich ones can work, and what ideas need to be put to bed. Once \\nagain, my hope is that we can focus on solutions that can \\nactually work, that can actually be enacted into law to pay for \\nhighways.\\n    For example, while I know the idea has some support, I do \\nnot think a massive increase in the gas tax could be enacted \\ninto law. Of course, anyone who believes otherwise is free to \\npublicly correct me and to try to make their case. That is the \\ntype of discussion I want to have here today--one that will \\nactually lead to solutions. To facilitate this discussion, we \\nhave assembled a distinguished panel of witnesses who I think \\nwill all bring a unique perspective to these issues. I look \\nforward to hearing from all of you at the table here on today\\'s \\npanel.*\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    * For more information, see also, ``Overview of Selected Tax \\nProvisions Relating to the Highway Trust Fund and Related Excise \\nTaxes,\\'\\' Joint Committee on Taxation staff report, June 16, 2015 (JCX-\\n93-15), https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=4791.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    With that, I will turn to Senator Wyden for his opening \\nstatement.\\n    [The prepared statement of Chairman Hatch appears in the \\nappendix.]\\n\\n             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, \\n                   A U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON\\n\\n    Senator Wyden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Chairman and colleagues, America\\'s transportation \\narteries--our roads, our highways, our ports, our bridges, our \\nrailways--give life to America\\'s economy. Now those arteries \\nneed major surgery, but instead the patient is bleeding out. \\nAnd short-term funding Band-Aids will not help without a solid \\nlong-term plan in place to solve this challenge.\\n    My belief is, you cannot have Big League economic growth \\nwith Little League infrastructure. The way Congress has limped \\nfrom one short-term funding patch to the next more than 30 \\ntimes unquestionably reflects a Little League strategy. The \\nstop-and-go approach without a viable long-term funding source \\nlowers America\\'s sights in terms of what our transportation \\nsystem can do. It forces States and Federal agencies into \\nmaking little plans--barely keeping up with the potholes and \\nfalling far behind on new railways, ports, and highways.\\n    Oregonians are now driving across bridges that are \\nstructurally deficient or functionally obsolete. They are \\nswerving around ruts on mountain passes that threaten to cause \\ndangerous accidents. And Oregonians sit in traffic jams, \\nburning through gas and wasting time, and these traffic jams, \\nnot just in my State but across the country, are being seen in \\nplaces nobody could have even imagined a traffic jam even a few \\nyears ago.\\n    The infrastructure crisis hurts our businesses and \\ndiscourages investments in Oregon and across America. China \\ninvests more than four times the amount our country does in \\ninfrastructure. Europe invests twice as much as we do. The fact \\nis, the costs associated with transportation and infrastructure \\nare always a part of the calculus when a company is deciding \\nwhere to invest and who to hire.\\n    A recent report from the American Society of Civil \\nEngineers said that the United States needs to invest $3.7 \\ntrillion in infrastructure by 2020--and $1.7 trillion in \\ntransportation infrastructure alone--just to reach what they \\nhave termed ``good condition.\\'\\' Another series of short-term \\npatches is not going to meet the bar. In the meantime, the same \\nreport found that Oregonians spend more than $650 million a \\nyear on auto repairs and other costs because our highways and \\nroads are crumbling.\\n    It is my view that funding a transportation network is \\nright up there with maintaining a fair judicial system and a \\nstrong national defense among the most basic and necessary \\nfunctions of government. There is a bipartisan understanding \\nthat our transportation system needs major investments, and you \\nhear this from members of both parties. So Congress and this \\ncommittee have a responsibility to now find a pathway that \\nleads to long-term funding sources, and I hope today\\'s hearing \\nreinforces the enormous need to accomplish this goal and help \\nus move closer to a solution.\\n    Next week, the committee is going to continue its \\nconsideration of this crucial topic of how to get private-\\nsector dollars off the sidelines and into funding American \\ninfrastructure. Several weeks ago, Senator Hoeven and I \\nintroduced a bipartisan proposal, the Move America Act, to \\nkick-start the use of effective financing tools to solve this \\ncrisis. The Move America Act would unlock $200 billion of \\nprivate-sector investment and could be a big part of getting \\nAmerica\\'s infrastructure back up to the big leagues.\\n    So I say to our witnesses, our guests, and our colleagues, \\ntoday we are going to focus on funding transportation. In a \\nweek, a week from today, we will focus on financing approaches \\nto pay for infrastructure. Both of them are extremely \\nimportant. I look forward to our witnesses. It is always good \\nto see Ray LaHood here. He has distinguished himself by always \\ntrying to bring people together with particularly innovative \\nthinking on transportation. So I welcome all of our guests, and \\nI have had a chance to talk with several of them. I usually \\ntalk with Mr. Moore about something like tax reform, but we are \\nhappy to have all of you here today, and thank you, Mr. \\nChairman.\\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you, Senator.\\n    [The prepared statement of Senator Wyden appears in the \\nappendix.]\\n    The Chairman. Today we have an excellent group of \\nwitnesses, people whom all of us respect.\\n    Our first witness will be Dr. Joseph Kile, Assistant \\nDirector of Microeconomic Studies at the Congressional Budget \\nOffice. Dr. Kile came to CBO in 2005 following 16 years at the \\nGovernment Accountability Office. And while at GAO, Dr. Kile \\nled the Center for Economics within the Applied Research and \\nMethods team. Before that, he was a Senior Economist and \\nAssistant Director within GAO\\'s Office of the Chief Economist. \\nHis analyses focused in particular on the issues of \\ntransportation, energy, natural resources and the environment, \\nand the pharmaceutical industry. He has both a master\\'s degree \\nand a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and \\na bachelor\\'s degree from St. Olaf College.\\n    We are really happy to welcome you here today, Doctor, and \\nwe look forward to hearing your testimony.\\n    Our second witness is a man we all respect and have a great \\ndeal of love and respect for: Secretary Ray LaHood. He served \\nas Secretary of Transportation for the Obama administration \\nfrom 2009 to 2013. Before heading the U.S. Department of \\nTransportation, Secretary LaHood served from 1995 to 2009 in \\nthe U.S. House of Representatives, representing the 18th \\nCongressional District of Illinois. Today he is here as a co-\\nchair of Building America\\'s Future, a bipartisan coalition of \\nelected officials working to advance infrastructure investment. \\nSecretary LaHood has a bachelor\\'s degree from Bradley \\nUniversity.\\n    And last, we are going to hear from the wonderful \\neconomist, Stephen Moore. From 2005 to 2014, Mr. Moore served \\nas the senior economics writer for the Wall Street Journal \\neditorial page and as a member of the Journal\\'s editorial \\nboard, and he continues to be a regular contributor at the Wall \\nStreet Journal and other media outlets like Fox News, CNN, and \\nCNBC. Before that, he served as founder and president of the \\nClub for Growth and served as Grover M. Hermann Fellow in \\nBudgetary Affairs at the Heritage Foundation. Mr. Moore has a \\nbachelor\\'s degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-\\nChampaign and a master\\'s degree from George Mason University.\\n    I want to personally thank all three of you for making time \\nin your busy schedules to be with us today, and we will have \\nyou proceed, Dr. Kile, and then go right down the line.\\n\\n    STATEMENT OF JOSEPH KILE, Ph.D., ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR \\nMICROECONOMIC STUDIES, CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, WASHINGTON, \\n                               DC\\n\\n    Dr. Kile. Thank you, Chairman Hatch, Senator Wyden, and \\nmembers of the committee. I appreciate the very warm welcome \\nand the opportunity to testify today about the status of the \\nHighway Trust Fund and about options for paying for highways.\\n    Let me first turn to the trust fund. In 2014, the Federal \\nGovernment and State and local governments spent about $165 \\nbillion to build, operate, and maintain highways. Those same \\ngovernments spent another $65 billion on mass transit systems. \\nAbout three-quarters of that total came from State and local \\ngovernments; the other one-quarter came from the Federal \\nGovernment, and most of that was through the Highway Trust \\nFund.\\n    For decades, the trust fund\\'s balances were stable or \\ngrowing. However, more recently, the amount of money collected \\nfrom taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, and other transportation-\\nrelated activities has been less than spending. To address that \\nshortfall, lawmakers have transferred $65 billion from the \\ngeneral fund of the Treasury to the trust fund since 2008.\\n    The Highway Trust Fund\\'s current sources of revenue cannot \\nsupport spending at the current rate. By the end of this fiscal \\nyear, CBO estimates that the balance in the highway account \\nwill be about $2 billion, and the balance in the transit \\naccount will be about $1 billion. Because of those declining \\nbalances, the Department of Transportation would probably need \\nto delay payments to States before the end of the current \\nfiscal year, and, beyond that, the shortfall in the trust fund \\nwould steadily accumulate in the future.\\n    Turning to options to pay for highways and transit, \\nlawmakers have three broad options. One option would be to \\nreduce Federal spending on highways and transit projects. If \\nlawmakers choose to eliminate the shortfall entirely by cutting \\nspending, all of the money credited to the fund next year would \\nbe needed for obligations that were made this year and in \\nprevious years. Beyond that, the authority to make new \\nobligations from the highway account would decrease by about \\none-third over the next decade, and the authority to make new \\nobligations from the transit account would decline by about \\ntwo-thirds compared with CBO\\'s baseline.\\n    A second broad option would be to increase revenues \\ncredited to the trust fund, and that could be done in several \\nways. For instance, one way to increase revenue would be to \\nraise existing taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel. JCT has \\nestimated that a 1-cent increase in those taxes would raise \\nabout $1.7 billion next year, but that amount would decline to \\nabout $1.5 billion by 2025. Increasing those taxes by roughly \\n10 cents per gallon would eliminate the projected shortfall \\nover the next decade. Another way to increase revenues would be \\nto impose new taxes on using the highway system, such as one \\nbased on vehicle miles traveled. Still another way to increase \\nrevenues would be to impose taxes on activities that are \\nunrelated to transportation.\\n    A third broad option for addressing the shortfall would be \\nto continue to transfer money from the general fund to the \\ntrust fund. Unless spending were cut or revenues were \\nincreased, that would require a transfer of about $3 billion \\nbefore the end of this fiscal year. After that, the amounts \\nneeded each year would start at $11 billion next year and grow \\nto $22 billion by 2025.\\n    In addition to those approaches to paying for highways, the \\nshortfall in the trust fund has generated interest in borrowing \\nby State and local governments and by private companies. The \\nFederal Government encourages such borrowing through tax \\npreferences, loans, and loan guarantees that provide a subsidy \\nfor financing highway projects. Through those channels, the \\nFederal Government bears some of the costs of such financing.\\n    Despite prominent examples, the experience with private \\nfinancing in the United States is fairly limited. In \\nparticular, highway projects that have used private financing \\nhave accounted for less than 1 percent of all spending for \\nhighways over the last 25 years. Some of those projects have \\nfailed financially because the revenues for the projects were \\noverestimated. Perhaps because of that experience, projects \\nthat are now under construction rely less on tolls as a revenue \\nsource. More commonly, private partners are compensated from a \\nState\\'s general fund. That reduces the risk to the private \\npartner that it will not be repaid, but as a result, the risk \\nof lower-than-expected revenues remains with the public sector.\\n    Finally, borrowing is only a mechanism for making future \\ntax revenues or user fees available to pay for transportation \\nprojects today. It is not a new source of revenues. In the \\nfuture, money used to repay borrowed funds will be unavailable \\nfor new transportation projects or other government priorities.\\n    Again, Chairman Hatch, Senator Wyden, thank you for the \\ninvitation, and I would be delighted to answer any questions \\nyou might have.\\n    [The prepared statement of Dr. Kile appears in the \\nappendix.]\\n    The Chairman. Thank you.\\n    Now, Mr. LaHood?\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF HON. RAY LaHOOD, SENIOR POLICY ADVISER, DLA PIPER, \\n                         WASHINGTON, DC\\n\\n    Mr. LaHood. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and thank you for your \\nleadership in holding this hearing and inviting people like \\nmyself and others who have been speaking out on the crisis that \\nwe have in America, which every member of this committee and \\nreally every member of Congress knows about, because all of you \\ncome from States and cities that have crumbling roads and \\nbridges that are in a very bad state of repair, the worst that \\nwe have seen ever in America. I have described our country as \\n``one big pothole.\\'\\'\\n    I come from Illinois. We have had some brutal winters, and \\nthose of you who come from States that have had brutal winters \\nknow that our roads are crumbling and our bridges are in a \\nvery, very bad state of repair. Fifty-year-old transit systems \\nneed replacement of cars and infrastructure.\\n    The other part of the crisis is not just in infrastructure \\nbut in funding. How are we going to pay for all the things that \\nAmerica needs? And in coming up with proposals, I am certainly \\none who has been very open-minded about the idea that you need \\na variety of ways to pay for infrastructure, just like we have \\ndone for years in America. America used to be number one in \\ninfrastructure. We are the country that built the Golden Gate \\nBridge, the Hoover Dam, the Erie Canal, and the Interstate \\nSystem.\\n    Those days are gone. When can any of you remember, except \\nfor maybe Senator Bennet, the last time we built an airport? \\nThe last time we built an airport in America was when the \\nDenver airport was built. Now, there have been some \\nmodernizations but--and all of you have traveled around the \\nworld, and what has happened around the world? Every time you \\ngo to China, you see a new road, a new bridge, a new airport, a \\nnew high-speed rail. And what does that do? That attracts \\neconomic development. It attracts companies that need the \\ninfrastructure to be able to locate their businesses there.\\n    When you build infrastructure, you build economic \\nopportunities for cities and States all along the corridors, \\nwhether it is a rail corridor, a roadway, a bridge. And we have \\ncome to a crisis in our country because we have run out of \\nmoney. The Highway Trust Fund is broke. Our transportation \\nsystem is broke. And America is looking to Congress for \\nleadership, the same kind of leadership that they are finding \\nin cities and in States. The cities are the incubators for \\ninnovative, creative approaches to transportation. The Mayors \\nare the innovators. The States where you have Governors who are \\nwilling to go to their legislatures and ask for increases in \\nrevenues, particularly in the gas tax, are making huge amounts \\nof opportunities to put friends and neighbors to work.\\n    Look, the revenue that comes in from the gas tax goes back \\nto the States. It helps hire friends and neighbors. When people \\nsee the orange cones, what do they see? They see their friends \\nand neighbors building roads and building economic \\nopportunities. That money does not stay here in Washington. It \\ngoes back to Governors and State DOTs and Mayors.\\n    So what I am suggesting is, we should look for many \\noptions, but, if you want to create an opportunity to rebuild \\nAmerica, we need a big pot of money--the same big pot of money \\nthat built America over the last 50 years--and that is the \\nHighway Trust Fund. We have to come to grips with the idea that \\nwe have to raise the gas tax. It has not been raised in 20 \\nyears. None of you can think of anything that has not been \\nraised in 20 years. Think of the cost of a stamp, the cost of \\nan automobile, the cost of a gallon of milk, the cost of a \\ndozen eggs. Everything has gone up--except the gas tax, except \\nthe pot of money that funds our infrastructure.\\n    So I am for tolling. We did a bunch of tolling projects, \\nsome in Virginia, some in other States, while I was DOT \\nSecretary. I am for public-private partnerships. The Silver \\nLine, which will connect downtown Washington with Dulles \\nAirport, is a great example of a public-private partnership. We \\nhelped fund that, with the help of Senator Warner and others.\\n    The Tappan Zee Bridge in New York is a great public-private \\npartnership, funded through the Transportation Infrastructure \\nFinance and Innovation Act loan program. I am for all of that. \\nBut if you want to get back to rebuilding America, you have to \\nhave a big pot of money. And the Highway Trust Fund is broke. \\nCome to grips with it. Fourteen States, including yours, Mr. \\nChairman, which--I do not need to tell you this--is a very \\nconservative State, all Republican, Senator Enzi\\'s State, a \\nvery conservative State, they raised the gas tax. They did it, \\nwith all Republicans in conservative States.\\n    Wyoming, Virginia, New Hampshire, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \\nVermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, \\nNebraska, South Dakota, and Utah all have raised the gas tax. \\nWhy? Because they are getting no activity, no action here in \\nWashington. And they need the money to fix up their \\ninfrastructure.\\n    So what I say to people in Washington--and I was an elected \\nofficial. I served in the House for 14 years. Do not be afraid \\nto raise the gas tax. Make it a part of the funding formula. Do \\nnot just discount it. It is the big pot of money that will get \\nus back in the game again. It will get us back to being number \\none in infrastructure and being able to attract businesses to \\nour communities.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am sorry to get a little \\noverreactive here, but I just feel so strongly about this, and \\nI look forward to your questions.\\n    The Chairman. Well, we allow for that. This is the \\ncommittee where everybody gets overreactive from time to time, \\non both sides. So we are happy to have you here and happy to \\nlisten to you.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. LaHood appears in the \\nappendix.]\\n    The Chairman. Mr. Moore, we are looking forward to your \\ntestimony too.\\n\\n STATEMENT OF STEPHEN MOORE, VISITING FELLOW IN ECONOMICS, THE \\n              HERITAGE FOUNDATION, WASHINGTON, DC\\n\\n    Mr. Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was heartened by your \\ncomment about tax reform. I have believed for a long time that \\nif we could just lock the two of you in a room for about 2 or 3 \\nhours, I mean, seriously, you could come up with a tax plan \\nthat would be so much more pro-growth and productive for our \\neconomy than what we have right now. And, by the way, that is \\nrelevant to this discussion. I believe if we had the right kind \\nof tax system, we could add 1 percentage point of GDP.\\n    The Chairman. Well, you are absolutely right. We could do \\nthat. Too bad we have 98 others to deal with.\\n    Mr. Moore. So why is it not happening? It could be one of \\nthe great bipartisan reforms that we have seen in 30 years.\\n    I am pro-roads. I agree with you: we need more roads in \\nthis country. But I am firmly against raising the gas tax at \\nthe Federal level to pay for it. So ``yes\\'\\' to more \\ninfrastructure, but ``no\\'\\' to a Federal tax increase. And one \\nof the reasons for that is simply that it is not fair to the \\nmiddle class. If you look at who gets hit hardest by a gas tax \\nincrease, there is no question that the middle class is the \\ngroup that gets hammered by this. So I did some statistics. For \\nevery 1-penny increase in the Federal gasoline tax, you are \\ngoing to pull about $1.5 billion out of the hands and \\npocketbooks of middle-class workers, and everyone in this room \\nknows that the middle class is financially strained right now. \\nIf you were to raise the gas tax by, say, 10 cents a gallon, \\nyou are talking about taking $15 billion out of the pockets of \\npeople who need that money. And I think it is an unfair way to \\nfinance this situation. By the way, it would be a negative \\nstimulus to the economy to raise the Federal gas tax at this \\ntime.\\n    Now, Federal funding peaked, as the Congressman said, in \\nthe late 1980s, but there is a reason for that, and that is, we \\nhave built a 42,000-mile interstate highway system, one of the \\ngreat Federal achievements of all time, but the Federal \\ninterstate highway system is built; it is done. It is like \\nsaying, you know, we should continue to spend money on the \\nApollo system to send someone to the Moon. We did it. No one \\ntalks about continuing to fund NASA for something that has \\nhappened.\\n    What I believe we ought to do as a strategy going forward \\nis allow the States to do exactly what Mr. LaHood said. If they \\nwant to finance their local and State road projects and \\ninfrastructure projects, they ought to do it. And one of the \\nways you can facilitate that happening, by the way, is not only \\nnot raising the Federal gasoline tax but talking about \\njudiciously lowering the Federal gas tax and allowing the \\nStates to fund these projects.\\n    Now, why is that a better system? Because we believe in \\nfederalism. Because we believe that the people in the State of \\nOregon and the people in the State of Utah can make much, much, \\nmuch better decisions about what road projects and bridge \\nprojects should be funded in Oregon and Utah than people here \\nin Washington, DC. It is that simple.\\n    By the way, there is a second reason for this. We believe, \\nI think we all believe, that a fundamental principle of a good \\ntransportation project is that the user pays. The person who \\nbenefits from the project pays for it. And, when you make it \\nmore locally and State-financed, you move closer to that kind \\nof funding system.\\n    Now, what could we do at the Federal level to make these \\ndollars that come in through the Federal system--which is close \\nto $40 billion a year--stretch further? And I would argue that \\na couple of things need to be done.\\n    One is, I believe that it is high time we stop stealing \\nmoney from motorists, people who drive their car to work in the \\nmorning like I do, taking my Federal gasoline tax money and \\nusing it to fund transit projects that I do not use. People who \\nuse the highways should pay a gas tax for the roads. People who \\nuse transit systems should pay fares or other kinds of charges \\nfor that. Right now you are diverting, I think--I may not be \\nexactly right about this--about 15 percent of Federal gasoline \\ntax money for transit projects that people who use the roads do \\nnot use. And we have a great example of that here in the State \\nof Virginia, where people like myself are going to have to pay \\nfor the Silver Line system, which, I am sorry, Congressman, I \\nthink is one of the biggest wastes of money in history, and I \\ndo use the toll road, and our tolls are going to go up, up, up, \\nup, up to pay for a Silver Line system that very few people are \\ngoing to use.\\n    Second of all, let us take a very serious look at repealing \\nthe Davis-Bacon law. This is a law that was passed 60 years ago \\nspecifically to keep minorities off of Federal road projects. \\nIt is discriminatory in effect, and it was discriminatory in \\nits intention, and it is high time we repeal this law. And, if \\nwe do that, for every four bridges and roads that you build \\nacross the country, you get a fifth one for free. You get a \\nfifth one for free. So, if we want to solve the infrastructure \\nproblem, let us do that.\\n    One other thing that I will bring up for you all to \\nconsider is that, you know, we have this whole discussion about \\nhow to finance roads, and no one is talking about efficiency \\nand productivity gains, and how do we make sure we are getting \\nthe most roads and the most transportation projects for the \\nmoney that is going to Washington? Now, the reason this is \\nimportant is, my friend Art Laffer and I did a book that came \\nout about a year ago where we looked at what States are \\nspending on highway projects, and it is amazing. I just want to \\ngive you a statistic about the difference between two States--\\nTexas and California.\\n    California spends about $250,000 per mile of road \\nprojects--$250,000. Texas spends $100,000 per mile of roads. \\nWhat explains the difference there? The explanation is, Texas \\nis much, much, much more efficient in the way it spends its \\nmoney. There are ways we can rebuild our infrastructure in a \\nmuch more efficient way and a much more productive way without \\nsucking more money out of the pockets of taxpayers.\\n    Thank you.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Moore appears in the \\nappendix.]\\n    The Chairman. Thanks to all three of you. We appreciate \\nyour being here and appreciate listening to you.\\n    Secretary LaHood, the bipartisan deficit reduction think \\ntank, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, or CRFB, \\non May 13, 2015, issued a pamphlet entitled, ``The Road to \\nSustainable Highway Spending.\\'\\' Now, the pamphlet provides a \\nmenu of trust fund solvency options, big, medium, and small, \\ndrawing on revenue raisers and spending cuts. I ask unanimous \\nconsent to insert a copy of the pamphlet in the record, and I \\nwill.\\n    [The pamphlet appears in the appendix on p. 45.]\\n    The Chairman. I am assuming you are familiar with that \\nparticular pamphlet.\\n    Mr. LaHood. Yes, sir.\\n    The Chairman. Okay. Now, Mr. Secretary, it is clear from \\nyour testimony and that of Mr. Moore that the two of you do not \\nagree on a gas tax increase. Your testimony is clear that you \\ndo not believe we should reduce current trust fund spending to \\nline up with current trust fund receipts. I am going to ask you \\nwhether we should look to proposals that score as outlay \\nreductions to offset the deficit impact of a general fund \\ntransfer.\\n    Now, here is one of the many examples from CRFB\\'s report. \\nThe proposal is to ``allow for drilling in ANWR and the Outer \\nContinental Shelf.\\'\\' Now that proposal, which is divisible \\nbetween ANWR and OCS pieces, CRFB scores at $5 billion in \\nsavings--as $1.5 billion in savings from the OCS piece, and the \\nANWR piece scores at roughly $2.5 billion. Now, CRFB indicates \\nadopting both pieces would mean 4 months of solvency.\\n    Now, Mr. Secretary, if it is not politically feasible to \\nraise the gas tax, would you agree that policymakers should \\nconsider spending reduction proposals like the ones listed by \\nthe bipartisan think tank as part of an interim or long-term \\nresolution of the Highway Trust Fund deficit?\\n    Mr. LaHood. Senator, I think that almost every member of \\nthis committee has a good deal of experience--or they would not \\nbe here--in terms of budgeting and finances. I think you have \\nto look at all alternatives. I do not think anything should be \\noff the table. I really do not. I am sorry, and I am \\ndisappointed that some people have taken raising the gas tax \\noff the table. I do not think it should be taken off the table, \\njust as I do not think this proposal should be. We have to find \\nnew ways, creative ways, to fund our roads and bridges. This is \\nan example of it. I think it should be on the table.\\n    The Chairman. All right. I appreciate that.\\n    Now, Mr. Moore, as a gas tax opponent, I am going to ask \\nyou the flip side of the question I just asked Secretary \\nLaHood. If Secretary LaHood\\'s view that restricting current \\nspending to current highway receipts is not politically \\npossible is valid, would you agree that policymakers should \\nconsider compliance revenue-raising proposals like the ones \\nlisted by the bipartisan think tank as part of an interim or \\nlong-term resolution of the Highway Trust Fund deficit? And let \\nme just provide one example from the bipartisan CRFB report.\\n    The proposal is to ``increase mortgage reporting.\\'\\' That--\\n--\\n    Mr. Moore. I am sorry. Increase what?\\n    The Chairman. ``Increase mortgage reporting.\\'\\' That \\nproposal would yield $2 billion, which would mean 2 months of \\ntrust fund solvency. What do you think?\\n    Mr. Moore. I cannot speak to that proposal. I have not \\nreally thought about it. But let me simply say this. On your \\nquestion to Secretary LaHood, this is a huge pot of money that \\nwe are talking about, and it is not just drilling in ANWR, sir. \\nWe could be drilling all over this country, and we have been \\ndoing some analysis of this at Heritage. I mean, the Federal \\nGovernment, if we drill everywhere, you know--and I am not \\ntalking about Yosemite and Yellowstone, but on Federal lands \\nthat are not environmentally sensitive--over the next 20 years \\nwe could raise somewhere in the neighborhood of $2 to $3 \\ntrillion--$2 to $3 trillion--in Federal money that would come \\nin through royalty payments and other fees that we could charge \\nthese energy companies. Now, my God, that is gigantic. I mean, \\nwe could use a huge percentage of that to reduce our national \\ndebt. We could use some of that money to build the kind of \\ninfrastructure that the Secretary is talking about. So we have \\na gigantic opportunity here.\\n    And I forgot to mention one other quick thing. You know, we \\nkeep hearing all of this talk in Washington about how we need \\ninfrastructure. We need infrastructure. We need to spend more \\non infrastructure. There is one area that we need \\ninfrastructure desperately on, even more than we need roads. \\nWhat we need in this country is an interstate system of \\npipelines so we can get the natural gas resources and the oil \\nresources that are so abundant in this country. I mean, the \\nshale oil and gas revolution is big, and we are just hitting \\nthe beginning stages of it. We have to build pipelines all over \\nthis country so we can get it to the market and we can sell it \\nabroad. And I bring that up because--I mean, we have an \\ninfrastructure project that would create 15,000 jobs, that \\nwould be free. It would not cost the Federal taxpayer one \\npenny, and it would be good for our national security and our \\nenergy policy, and that is the Keystone Pipeline. And that is \\njust one of these--you know, there are about 20 major pipelines \\nthat are being held up at the Federal level.\\n    Yes, we need more infrastructure. Let us start with the \\neasy ones that do not cost taxpayers a penny. Let us start with \\nKeystone.\\n    The Chairman. Thank you. My time is up. Senator Wyden?\\n    Senator Wyden. Thank you very much.\\n    Secretary LaHood, let me start with a proposal that has \\nbeen advanced in the Senate and has elicited a fair amount of \\ndiscussion in the transportation area called ``devolution.\\'\\' \\nThis is a proposal, Secretary LaHood, that would not only \\neliminate the Federal highway program, but would also \\nsignificantly reduce funds for the States. And I do not know \\nhow they would proceed, but I assume they would just raise \\ntheir taxes. What do you think of this? It has been introduced \\nin----\\n    Mr. LaHood. I think it is a very, very, very, very, very \\nbad idea. We would--look, if devolution had been in existence, \\nwe would not have an interstate system, because if you look \\nback on the history of the interstate system, there were some \\nGovernors, when President Eisenhower signed the interstate \\nbill, who said, ``There will never be a road through my \\nState.\\'\\' Fifty years later, we have an interstate system. Our \\ncountry is connected with the best road system in the world, \\nbar none. Devolution would never allow that to happen.\\n    And, if we want to fix up our interstates--every one of you \\nhas an interstate running through your State, and you all know \\nwhat they look like. They are crumbling. They need some Federal \\nresources to fix them up, and we owe it to the States, to the \\nGovernors, to the communities to do that. That is what a \\nnational program does. Devolution would destroy that kind of \\nopportunity.\\n    Senator Wyden. Let me see if I can capture your philosophy, \\nwhich I think is very attractive on this point. What you are \\nsaying is, this committee needs to get funding right. That is \\nour first assignment.\\n    Mr. LaHood. Correct.\\n    Senator Wyden. But you are also saying that we ought to be \\nlooking at the whole toolbox, and finance ought to be part of \\nit. And because I have you here and I respect your views, let \\nme ask you: were you surprised that $188 billion worth of Build \\nAmerica bonds were sold in less than a year and a half?\\n    Mr. LaHood. Of course not. It is a great program, not just \\nbecause you were one of the authors of the legislation, but \\nbecause it worked. And that should be part of the solution. Put \\nthat in the highway bill. That ought to be a part of it, ought \\nto be a part of the funding.\\n    Senator Wyden. Good. A question for you, Dr. Kile, if I \\nmight. On the question of budget issues, what I think people \\nreally are interested in is, as it relates to the budget--and \\nthis is in your bailiwick--what is your best analysis there \\nabout the economic effects of public investment in \\ninfrastructure? From the seat of my pants, I always say, if \\nthere is a town hall meeting, that investing in infrastructure \\nis a big economic multiplier. You see it with people working. \\nYou see it with people buying equipment. You know, restaurants \\nhave to make sandwiches for the folks who are doing the work. \\nThere is clothing, cleaning. It is a big economic multiplier. \\nBut what is important is that we have really thoughtful \\nanalysis like you all do in terms of the economic effects of \\npublic investment in infrastructure, and I would just like to \\nwrap up with your thoughts on that topic.\\n    Dr. Kile. Thank you, Senator. Yes, in the past we have \\nanalyzed the work of the Federal Highway Administration and \\nconcluded that, to maintain current levels of highway services, \\nspending would need to be raised from the current level. Also, \\njust yesterday, CBO issued its long-term budget outlook, and, \\nin that outlook, we talked about the importance of \\ninfrastructure spending and how that contributes to economic \\ngrowth and how that is included in our models.\\n    Senator Wyden. So, can you give us a little bit of the \\nhighlights?\\n    Dr. Kile. In the report that was issued yesterday, we \\ntalked about the returns to Federal investment in \\ninfrastructure spending being about half as productive as \\nsimilar investment spending by the private sector. But, of \\ncourse, there are things that the public sector will invest in \\nthat the private sector might not choose to.\\n    Senator Wyden. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    The Chairman. Senator Grassley?\\n    Senator Grassley. Mr. Chairman, instead of asking \\nquestions, I prefer to use my time just to make a short \\nstatement.\\n    The Chairman. Okay.\\n    Senator Grassley. Congress is once again faced with the \\ntask of reauthorizing our Nation\\'s surface and transportation \\nlaws. The Finance Committee, as always, will play a vital role \\nin this process, as we have to make the important decisions \\nabout the future of the Highway Trust Fund.\\n    Transportation is essential to the economy, trade, and \\nvitality of all of our States. In Iowa, it is fundamental to \\nmoving our agricultural products, manufactured goods, and \\npeople. We do not have a lot of inner-city transportation \\notherwise. Iowa also has a large number of trucking companies, \\nand truck traffic through our State is very high. Therefore, \\nCongress must be in pursuit of sound, sustainable highway \\npolicies that provide certainty to businesses, States, and the \\ntransportation community.\\n    I am a former chairman of this committee, so I know how \\nhard it is for Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden to find a \\nconsensus on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers on \\nthis issue. However, I urge all those involved in these \\nnegotiations to come to the table, including this Senator, to \\ngive and take, including all three aspects--and most often we \\ntalk about spending and the revenue side, but I follow along \\nwhat our witness Mr. Moore says. We also have a regulation side \\nof this that ought to be dealt with, and we ought to do the \\nnegotiations to have a timely solution.\\n    I am dedicated to continuing to work with the chairman and \\nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this done. \\nHowever, it is also important that Congress hold up our end of \\ncurrent law and keep the Highway Trust Fund funded in the short \\nterm so that we can focus on the long-term policy and financing \\nsolutions.\\n    So, I would like to be very clear. Everyone wants to get a \\nlong-term reauthorization bill. However, there are serious \\ndiscussions and negotiations that need to take place within \\nthis committee on how to raise at least $90 billion if we are \\nto maintain current law. But, as I just indicated on \\nregulations, some of that $90 billion can surely be made up by \\nhaving less Federal Government dictation to the States on how \\nthat Federal dollar can be spent.\\n    Now, this $90 billion is not an insignificant amount of \\nmoney. A short-term extension should not be used as a pawn in \\nthe political gamesmanship when States like Iowa are in the \\nmiddle of a construction season. The unrest that multiple stop-\\ngap measures create, as well as the uncertainty, causes havoc \\nfor State Departments of Transportation. It is imperative that \\nthere be some continuity throughout the rest of the year.\\n    So I thank all the witnesses--even though I do not have \\nquestions, that does not mean your testimony is not important--\\nand the chairman for having this hearing to highlight and \\nprovide the facts of the current financing situation.\\n    Thanks to all my colleagues and the witnesses for \\nlistening.\\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you, Senator.\\n    Senator Thune is next.\\n    Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    I would like to just ask the panel what the impact is on \\nthe economy--we talk about economic impacts of these various \\nalternatives that always get discussed. What is the impact on \\nthe economy of borrowing, of additional debt? We already have a \\nvery high debt-to-GDP ratio, whether you compute that using \\njust publicly held debt or total debt--historically high \\nlevels. And, if you look at the 10-year outlook, according to \\nthe CBO, it gets increasingly worse over time.\\n    So if we were to, as you pointed out, Dr. Kile, borrow, as \\nwe have, $65 billion since 2008--I mean, it is a general fund \\ntransfer, but it is in effect debt, right? I mean we are \\npassing it on to the next generation. We are just borrowing the \\nmoney.\\n    Dr. Kile. The general fund is paid for with a mix of \\ncurrent revenue and borrowing, yes.\\n    Senator Thune. Okay. So tell me, what is the economic \\nimpact of just continuing to do what we are doing today, which \\nis add these things to the debt through general fund transfers?\\n    Dr. Kile. The long-term effect of increased debt is \\nsomething that CBO has written about, and I am not terribly \\nfamiliar with that work. But as a general statement, it is \\nsomething that is not sustainable in the long term, and it will \\nimpose an eventual drag on the economy.\\n    Senator Thune. All right. Well, here is the thing. To me \\nthere are really three options. You can spend at the current \\nlevel of receipts coming into the Highway Trust Fund, which \\nwould represent about a 30-percent reduction over existing \\ncommitments that we have in the Highway Trust Fund. You can \\nfind savings, which we all ought to do, through reforms, and \\nlook for ways to do things more efficiently. And I would love \\nto get rid of some of the things that we spend out of the \\nHighway Trust Fund today, for example, transit, but that was \\ntried a couple years ago in the Republican-controlled House, \\nand they could not pass it. There are certain things that are \\njust politically realistic, that are practical in light of \\nwhere we are, and I do not think reducing spending by 30 \\npercent is one of those. I think people are going to want to \\nmake sure that we are taking care of our infrastructure and \\nhighways.\\n    So you can spend at that lower level. You can figure out a \\nway to find the revenues to pay for the $92 to $94 billion that \\nwe would need just to keep funding at the current level. Or you \\ncan borrow it, which is what we have been doing. And to me, \\nthat is unacceptable. We cannot just keep, as a matter of \\npractice, borrowing money from the general fund and handing the \\nbill to our children and grandchildren. If we are going to have \\nthings in this country, we ought to pay for them.\\n    Now, it gets very complicated, I know, on how to do that, \\nbut our State of South Dakota has to balance its budget every \\nyear. I mean, here in Washington, we do not labor under that \\nuncomfortable proposition. We can just borrow it and continue \\nto add it to the debt. But our State of South Dakota is one of \\nthose that did this year raise the gas tax, and they did it \\nbecause they felt that they had obligations that they had to \\nmeet. They were trying to plan for the future.\\n    And so I guess I am sitting here left with, what do we have \\nin terms of alternatives, because nobody around here wants to \\nmake the hard decisions, and politicians generally follow the \\npath of least resistance, and the path of least resistance, at \\nleast in the recent years, has been to borrow it, because that \\nis the easiest thing to do. And that is just not right. We \\ncannot keep doing that.\\n    So I guess, as I look at this issue and you all look at \\nthis issue, we have had a user fee-based program for a lot of \\nyears, and it seems to have worked pretty well, but it is \\ninadequate to the job today for what we have in terms of \\ndemands. And so, if we could figure out a combination of \\nspending reforms, we ought to start there, figure out how we \\ncan spend less, but--I guess I would just put it all out there \\nfor you. Secretary LaHood, you have suggested an increase in \\nthe gas tax. Mr. Moore says no gas tax. Dr. Kile, you have \\ntalked about a vehicle-miles-traveled approach. But there has \\nto be a user fee-based way of making this work, and it has to \\nbe a national system. I do not think you can back out and say \\nwe are just going to devolve all this to the States. I mean, \\ncertainly that does not work if you are going to have a \\nnational transportation system.\\n    So, as you look at all these options and all these \\nalternatives and you think of a vehicle-miles-traveled or some \\nsort of approach like that, what would you think about that, \\nSecretary LaHood? If you had some sort of different approach--\\n--\\n    Mr. LaHood. I think that there is at least one State, the \\nState of Oregon, that has put that into a demonstration program \\nto see how it works. The demonstration is for 5,000 vehicles to \\nsee how it works.\\n    But, Senator, number one, this is truly a user fee. That is \\nwhy it does not cause that much irritation when you say to \\ntaxpayers, ``We are going to raise the gas tax, which has not \\nbeen raised in 20 years, and we are going to give it back to \\nthe States. We are going to give it back to Americans. We are \\ngoing to give the money to State DOTs and to Governors, who \\nthen transfer it back to contractors and road builders and \\nbridge builders.\\'\\' And what do they do? They pay middle-income \\npeople to reconstruct, to rebuild our interstates and our \\nbridges.\\n    This money is invested in America. It does not stay here in \\nWashington. It does not go into some pot somewhere where nobody \\never sees it. It is reinvested in our friends and neighbors, \\nand reinvested in infrastructure. This infrastructure becomes \\nthe economic engine that attracts businesses. The first thing a \\nbusiness looks for when it goes to a State is, what kind of \\nroads do you have? What kind of sewers and water do you have? \\nHow are my people going to get back and forth to work? And that \\nis why Texas is one of the fastest-growing States in the \\ncountry, because they have great infrastructure. That is why \\nChina is attracting so much business, because every day they \\nare building a new road, a new bridge, a new high-speed rail. \\nWhen the national government invests in its people, it is a \\nwinner.\\n    The Chairman. Okay. Senator Cantwell?\\n    Senator Cantwell. ``LaHood for President.\\'\\' [Laughter.]\\n    I wish you would jump in the race of multiple people on the \\nother side of the aisle and express that, because I certainly \\nagree with you. And I am sorry I missed your testimony earlier, \\nbut I wanted to ask you, Mr. Secretary, about the freight \\nactivity that your administration led, when you were Secretary, \\nand how important is it that, if we move forward on \\ninfrastructure financing, that freight and multimodal \\ninvestments be made so we can be competitive in how we move \\nproducts, given the infrastructure investments being made in \\nother parts of the world that are going to challenge our \\ndelivery system?\\n    Mr. LaHood. Well, first of all, Senator, thank you for your \\nleadership on freight. Freight really is multimodal. Obviously, \\na couple years ago you really got that, tried to get it \\nincluded in the MAP-21 bill, and, for whatever reasons, money \\nreasons primarily, people around here thought it probably could \\nnot get done.\\n    But I think what you were able to do is get a commitment \\nfrom the leadership and from our administration to create a \\nFreight Council at DOT. You have put together, I think, a very \\ncomprehensive program, and, because it is multimodal, it means \\nit includes all modes of transportation. Freight capacity is \\nthe next generation of transportation. It is where the country \\nis going. And with the new channel opening at the Panama Canal, \\nwe know we are going to have to--right now there are only two \\nports in America that can handle the Panamax ships that are \\ngoing to be coming through. Now, that is a disgrace in our \\ncountry. With all the ports that we have, only two can accept \\nthese Panamax ships?\\n    But because of the kind of very comprehensive freight \\npolicy that you have developed, what I encourage you to do, \\nSenator, is see if you can get your bill into the next \\ntransportation bill. It needs to be there. If we are going to \\ntake advantage of the Panama Canal adding a new channel and all \\nthe multimodalism that goes with that, whether it is trucks or \\nrail or ports, we need a program. And we cannot use the excuse \\nthat we cannot afford it. We cannot afford not to do it. That \\nis the answer, particularly with what is going on at the Panama \\nCanal. And every one of you who has a port needs to be thinking \\nabout this. We need a multimodal, strong freight policy. It \\nought to be included in the next transportation bill, and I \\nhope you will keep pushing for it and keep pushing Secretary \\nFoxx, my successor, to make it a part of the administration\\'s \\npriorities.\\n    Senator Cantwell. Well, I appreciate that, and ``Ports Are \\nUs\\'\\' when it comes to the Pacific Northwest. I guarantee you, \\nwe get it, and we see incredible competition from Vancouver, \\nBritish Columbia, and other ports on the west coast all the \\ntime. So if we lost that freight business, obviously it would \\nhurt our economy immensely.\\n    But I think it was best said by one of our local providers \\nin Vancouver, WA. The second largest grain elevator in the \\nentire world is right there at Vancouver. And I said, ``Why is \\nthe second largest grain elevator in the entire world right \\nhere?\\'\\' And he said, ``Because the rising middle class in Asia \\nwants to eat beef, and we have to sell them grain.\\'\\' And that \\nsays it all. There is a rising middle class around the globe. \\nThe U.S. has a tremendous economic opportunity to ship product \\nto them, a new customer base, if you will. But if our \\ninfrastructure chokeholds them and they can get product from \\nSouth America or someplace else easier, we are going to lose \\ncritical business. And I already see, because we have this \\ncomplexity of moving so much oil product now and other \\nproducts, basically we are pushing good agricultural products \\noff the rails.\\n    So we have to get an infrastructure solution here that \\nhelps us move forward, so thank you for your leadership.\\n    Mr. LaHood. Thank you.\\n    The Chairman. Okay. Senator Coats?\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Just to follow up on the presidential aspirations here, \\nsince my colleagues said there might be some, we have all we \\nneed on our side and more. [Laughter.] It appears that the \\nother side is looking for an alternative. You have served both \\nas a Republican Congressman but in a Democratic administration \\nas Secretary of Transportation. Without being too pun-ish here, \\nyou could be the bridge that gets us on the road to the \\npresidency.\\n    The Chairman. There you go. [Laughter.]\\n    Mr. LaHood. Here is the bottom line for me. My oldest son \\nis running in a special election for Congress in the 18th \\nDistrict. The last thing he wants is his father talking about \\nrunning for something.\\n    Senator Coats. Okay. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I did not \\nmean to start with that, but there it is.\\n    First of all, I want to thank you and the ranking member \\nfor the selection of witnesses. I have sat through a lot of \\nboring hearings, but this one is really dynamic, because \\neverybody is speaking their mind straight out, giving us the \\nalternatives. They are passionate about it. It is a project \\nthat has the reality to it that we need to get something done. \\nTo me, it is a lot more than just finding the cost to pay for \\nthe gap, but there really needs to be some policy changes here \\nif we are going to really address this larger program.\\n    Now, economic growth was mentioned, and my colleague here, \\nRon Wyden, left, but I know both the chairman and the ranking \\nmember are intent on moving us to comprehensive tax reform. \\nThat, combined with regulatory reform and some fiscal reform--\\nand by that, I mean finally getting to the point here with our \\nFederal revenues where we separate the essential from the, \\n``Yeah, we would like to do that, but we cannot afford it right \\nnow,\\'\\' from the, ``Why are we doing that in the first place?\\'\\' \\nThat is how I kind of evaluate fiscal reform here, and, \\nclearly, infrastructure falls in the top line. And maybe we \\ncould pay for this through fiscal reform combined with tax \\nreform and regulatory reform, but those are long-term issues \\nthat we fight over, and we cannot seem to get there. But \\neconomic growth can solve an awful lot of problems here, \\nwhether it is medical research or whether it is paving roads \\nand building bridges and everything else in between.\\n    The shift to the States--I would like your responses \\nrelative to how much we could shift to the States. My State \\ntells me, the Department of Transportation tells me, that they \\ncould save up to 25 percent if they had more flexibility \\nrelative to what they now have to comply with at the Federal \\nlevel, giving them more flexibility on this. On MAP-21, I had \\nseveral amendments. They all went down in flames relative to \\ngiving States more flexibility. But you have all mentioned \\nthat; you have all talked about that. But how essential is it \\nthat, as a policy reform, we give some flexibility and \\ndevolution to the States in terms of how--I can go through all \\nthe statistics, but I think that you know what they are. And if \\nwe did that, what are the top priorities? Where would you \\nstart? I had an amendment on separating mass transit, and that \\nwas mentioned here. For building roads, you pay the gas tax to \\nbuild roads. For mass transit, you pay a tax because you jump \\non the mass transit. And separating those two would make a big \\ndifference.\\n    But anyway, let\\'s have the three of you give a quick \\nanswer--my time is running out--to that question as to if we \\ndid that, given the political realities, what would be the top \\ntwo or three things you think we could accomplish. Just go down \\nthe line here.\\n    Mr. Moore. Well, this is something I very strongly endorse. \\nI am not talking about total repeal of the Federal gas tax. \\nThere is no question--I think Secretary LaHood and I agree that \\nthere are certain elements of the Interstate Highway System \\nthat are properly federally funded. And what I am saying is \\nthat, when we are talking about funding of local roads and \\nlocal transit projects and local bridges and things like that \\nthat are totally contained in one State, why in the world do we \\nwant to have the Federal Government collect the money and tell \\nthe States what they should build?\\n    The one thing I find that I disagree with the Secretary on, \\nas he said, look, we are going to collect all this Federal \\nmoney from the gas tax, and we are going to give it back to the \\nStates. Well, why? Why does the Federal Government have to be \\nin that role at all? Why not have the Federal Government fund \\nthe portions of the road system that are truly interstate, and, \\nfor local roads, let States build them and fund them \\nthemselves? And you are exactly right, Senator, that you are \\ngoing to see efficiency gains, no question about it.\\n    I mean, the biggest boondoggle, in my opinion, in the \\nhistory of the United States, the biggest, biggest waste of \\nmoney--you know, and that is saying a lot--is probably this \\nhigh-speed rail project in California, $70 billion. And there \\nis nobody who is going to ride this thing. You are talking \\nabout a State that is completely virtually bankrupt with \\npension problems, and they are going to spend $70 billion on a \\nhigh-speed rail system that nobody is going to ride.\\n    Then you ask the question: why? Why would the people in \\nCalifornia build such an absurd project? And the answer is very \\nsimple, Senator. The reason they are building this is that the \\nFederal Government, people in Wyoming, people in my home State \\nof Illinois, people in Florida, are going to fund this project. \\nAnd, if California had to fund it themselves, I guarantee you \\nthis big white elephant project would never be funded. And that \\nkind of thing happens all the time in our transportation \\nsector.\\n    What I would do--and this gets to what Senator Thune was \\ntalking about. We have a massive debt problem. You are right \\nabout this, Senator. We ought to take, you know, five areas--\\ntransportation, education, health care, job training, labor--\\nand just create five giant block grants and just give those \\nGovernors the money. They can save 20 percent right off the \\ntop. And you know what? I will bet you, because I have talked \\nto the Governors, and I have asked them: if we said we would \\ngive you the money with more flexibility, would you take 80 \\ncents on the dollar? And almost all of them have said ``yes.\\'\\'\\n    The Chairman. Senator, your time is up.\\n    Mr. LaHood. Senator, I just need to say one word about \\nhigh-speed rail. I think it is a little funny here that Mr. \\nMoore is suggesting that we ought to give more responsibility \\nto Governors. The reason that California wants high-speed rail \\nis because the Governor wanted it. A Republican Governor, \\nGovernor Schwarzenegger, started that program. You cannot have \\nit both ways here, Mr. Moore. You cannot say, well, let us give \\nthe Governors all this responsibility and give them the money \\nback, and then when they decide they want to use it on high-\\nspeed rail, well, you do not like that idea, so it is a bad \\nidea.\\n    Hey, it does not work that way. If you want the Governors \\nto have it, let them choose. What did Schwarzenegger choose? \\nWhat did Governor Brown choose? High-speed rail. Why? Because \\nyou think they ought to have the responsibility to do it, \\nexcept when you do not like their idea.\\n    Mr. Moore. No, but the reason they are building it is \\nbecause the Californians are not paying for it. People from all \\nof the other States are paying for it.\\n    Mr. LaHood. The California Assembly has passed millions of \\ndollars of California taxpayer money to fund this project. That \\nis how it is getting funded.\\n    Senator Coats. Like I said, Mr. Chairman, this is a great \\nhearing. [Laughter.]\\n    The Chairman. Ray, I want you to keep your health here now. \\n[Laughter.] All of us get worked up on this issue.\\n    Senator Menendez is next.\\n    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Look, I would like to say that if I followed Mr. Moore\\'s \\nthinking, Eisenhower would not have opened up a national \\nhighway system; we would not have been at the point when we \\nwere the envy of the world in infrastructure, in ports, in rail \\nconnections to get people to work, to get product to market, to \\nget product shipped internationally. That is just not going to \\nbe done by the private sector.\\n    And I will tell you, as a person representing the highest \\nper capita income in the Nation, we send a lot of our money to \\na lot of other places, including your State, Mr. Moore. So the \\nreality is, that is not a particularly compelling argument to \\nme.\\n    Let me just say we have heard today a lot about the focus \\non highway programs, which are important, but our Nation\\'s \\ntransit programs are equally, in my view, if not even more \\ncritical to our mobility and economic competitiveness.\\n    Now, there are some interesting assertions in today\\'s \\ntestimony, including a comment that transit should not be \\nfunded by motorists who, by definition, do not use the trains, \\nsubways, and buses. Well, let me make it clear. I am a motorist \\nwho uses mass transit. And given the fact that, under a \\nconservative estimate, there are more than 860,000 park-and-\\nride spaces at transit stations, I do not think I am the only \\none.\\n    In fact, 82 percent of U.S. transit riders live in a \\nhousehold with a car, and, of the transit riders with access to \\na car, 87 percent use the vehicle more than three times a week. \\nThese people are all paying into the Highway Trust Fund, and \\nthey all rely on more than roads just to get around.\\n    A modern transportation system cannot be about highways \\nalone. We need a system with safe and efficient roads and rails \\nand transit lines and ports, and we need to think about it \\nholistically, with each mode of transportation working together \\nin concert to increase efficiency and synergism. And we have a \\nlong way to go to get there. I saw the House debating about $1 \\nbillion for Amtrak versus $1.3 billion. China spent $121 \\nbillion in 1 year on their rail and transit systems, and their \\neconomy is going pretty strong.\\n    So I would like to ask--and before I do, I would like to \\nrecognize somebody who I think is very prescient in today\\'s \\ndebate that we are having. It is a quote that says, ``Anyone \\nwho has driven the family car lately knows what it is like to \\nhit a pothole: a frustration, an expense, a danger caused by \\npoor road maintenance. Our cities need new buses, new and \\nrebuilt rail cars, and track improvements. Common sense tells \\nus that it will cost a lot less to keep the system we have in \\ngood repair than to let it disintegrate and have to start over \\nfrom scratch. Clearly, this program is an investment in \\ntomorrow that we must make today.\\'\\'\\n    Now, that quote did not come from some radical liberal or \\neven a moderate Democrat. It came from a Republican, and not \\njust any Republican: Ronald Reagan at the presidential signing \\nceremony for the 1982 transportation bill, a bill that both \\nraised the gas tax and created the mass transit account of the \\nFederal Highway Trust Fund. So, despite the passage of time, we \\nfind ourselves today facing many of the challenges that he \\nacknowledged nearly 3 decades ago. And I hope we can do it in a \\nbipartisan way.\\n    Secretary LaHood, I would like you to get to two points, if \\nyou can, in the time I have left. There is this myth that \\ntransit is only used in urban, Democratic areas of the country. \\nYou served as a Republican member of Congress--I was pleased to \\nserve with you--representing an area that included Peoria, \\nwhich has had a transit system for decades. Can you speak to \\nthe importance of Federal investment in transit services for \\ncommunities of all sizes? And can you also speak to the fact \\nthat your testimony notes that, in the three transportation \\nbills prior to MAP-21, Congress increased investment levels in \\nthe range of 40 to 45 percent, but in MAP-21 we only did a \\nsmall increase to keep up with inflation? What are the real-\\nworld impacts of the economic consequences of doing that? \\nBecause I see that half of our entire Nation\\'s GDP is generated \\nin 23 metropolitan areas, between the realities of rural \\nAmerica and suburban America that very often need rail, and the \\nrealities of so much GDP generated in these more metropolitan \\nareas, this is an economic imperative, isn\\'t it?\\n    Mr. LaHood. People who are middle-income people or \\ncertainly people below middle income, people who are working \\npeople, many of these folks cannot afford a car. They rely on \\nmass transit. They rely on buses, light rail--and mass transit \\nis their lifeline to their job, to their doctor\\'s appointments, \\nto the grocery store. This is how they get around. And not just \\nin places like Chicago or New York or other big cities. In \\nplaces like Peoria, IL, where I still have a home, we have a \\ngreat mass transit system. It is all buses. But people rely on \\nit every day because it is cost-efficient. They do not have to \\nhave a car, they do not have to pay insurance for a car, and, \\nfrankly, they cannot afford it.\\n    So, for all of the talk about how we are going to help \\npeople raise their ability to have a good income and to live \\nthe American dream, part of that is making sure that they have \\nthe kind of transportation they need. A lot of people cannot \\nafford a car, and particularly people who are just coming out \\nof college, who are moving to cities like Chicago or \\nWashington, DC. They are going to rely on mass transit. They \\nare going to rely on buses or Metro systems or the CTA, or \\nwhatever it is. And certainly in the State you come from, \\nSenator, I do not have to tell you how many people use mass \\ntransit. Thousands. What happened during Sandy? Thousands of \\npeople could not get to work. And how did they do it? Buses \\nwere rented so they could get to work.\\n    This is an important part of our transportation system. We \\nare not going to give up on it, and we should not--for the \\npeople, not for us. We all own cars. But for the people, the \\nworking people----\\n    The Chairman. Senator, your time is up.\\n    Senator Cardin, you are next.\\n    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank \\nour witnesses, and I want to thank you for holding this \\nhearing, because it is particularly important that we deal with \\nthe 6-year reauthorization of the transportation program, and \\nit has to be done by the current deadline of the end of next \\nmonth. It is critically important. If we do not get it done \\nnow, then we know we are going to be punting again, and it is \\ngoing to have an incredible impact on my State, on Utah, and \\nevery State in this country.\\n    The Chairman. If I could just interrupt, I will give you \\nsome additional time. One of our problems, Mr. LaHood--and I \\nhave great respect for you, as you know. One of our problems is \\nthat we do not believe we can get a tax increase through, and \\nthe House is not going to take it. They made it very clear to \\nus. And frankly, a lot of the Senators do not want to do it \\nthat way either. So we are going to have to come up with a way \\nof solving this problem, hopefully to all of your satisfaction, \\nreally in the next number of weeks, it seems to me.\\n    Sorry to interrupt you. I will give you----\\n    Senator Cardin. That is all right. I appreciate it, Mr. \\nChairman, and we understand the political realities, and I am \\ngoing to talk a little bit about that, and hopefully have time \\nfor some questions.\\n    But I really want to underscore--I was out in western \\nMaryland on Saturday. Mr. LaHood, as you point out, on the \\neconomic development, that north-south highway in western \\nMaryland is critically important to the economic future of the \\nwestern part of my State. If they do not complete the \\nAppalachian Highway, it is going to be very difficult to \\nattract the type of industry they need. So a 6-year \\nreauthorization is the only way they are going to accomplish \\nthe completion of the Appalachian Highway.\\n    Or I could go to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where we \\nhave 301, an incredibly important road with real safety issues \\nthat have to be addressed. We cannot do it under just the State \\nfunds or a short-term patch. You need to have a multi-year \\ncommitment as a Federal partner in order to be able to move \\nforward in those programs.\\n    I could talk about our two urban areas, Baltimore and \\nWashington. I was with Senator Warner yesterday as we got a \\nbriefing from the FTA as to the safety issues on the Metro \\nsystem here, and they need to be held accountable. They must \\nmake safety a priority. This is a 40-year-old system. It costs \\nmoney to replace cars to make them more safe. It costs money to \\nput in the communications systems they need. They need \\nresources. There is no question. They need accountability also. \\nWe understand that. The expansion of the Metro system here, the \\nPurple Line, is critically important for the congestion, or the \\nRed Line in Baltimore--all the transit programs.\\n    I commute back and forth from Baltimore. This region is the \\nsecond most congested region in the Nation outside of New York. \\nSo if we cannot get a 6-year reauthorization, we are putting \\nour communities at risk. There is no question about it. I want \\nto start with the fact that there is no option but to pass a 6-\\nyear reauthorization if we want to deal with the safety issues, \\nif we want to deal with the economic issues, if we want to deal \\nwith the quality of life issues that we are confronting.\\n    So let me deal with the chairman\\'s comment. If we just hold \\nour own, it is going to cost about $100 billion. If we pass a \\nbill that represents the current needs--and you can use the \\nPresident\\'s budget as a recommendation--then we are about $250 \\nbillion short. And we need to find the money to go into the \\ntransportation system that provides the permanent way to deal \\nwith it. And I must tell you, there have been many suggestions \\nmade by my colleagues that I am prepared to support, but I am \\nmindful of what the chairman said, that we have to find a \\ncommon way to move this forward.\\n    So, Mr. Chairman, let us look at some of the \\nrecommendations that have been made by both Democrats and \\nRepublicans. We have international tax reform that has been put \\non the table. We know that our corporate tax rates are not \\ncompetitive, and we have money trapped overseas, and we have to \\ndeal with how that money is going to be brought back to this \\ncountry.\\n    The President has made a recommendation in this area that \\nwill provide some permanent revenues as well as one-time-only \\nrevenues. I want to make sure that we have enough permanent \\nrevenues in the Transportation Trust Fund so that we can have a \\n6-year reauthorization without another cliff.\\n    The Chairman. Well, as you know, that is going to have a \\nvery rough time flying, especially with the Joint Tax report \\nthat says really it will lose $120 billion over 10 years. So, \\nyou know, we are going to go through every possible way of \\nfunding this, and we have gone through that as well. And I \\njust--this is not an easy job, I am telling you. But we are \\ngoing to solve this problem.\\n    Senator Cardin. And I agree with the chairman that it is \\nnot an easy job. I would suggest that some of our colleagues \\nworking across party lines, Democrats and Republicans, have \\ncome up with recommendations that overcome some of the scoring \\nproblems that have been raised.\\n    I agree, bottom line, we have to find the revenue so that \\nwe have a 6-year reauthorization that does not create another \\ncliff at the end of the 6 years. That is absolutely essential. \\nAnd I understand the chairman\\'s concerns as to the political \\nrealities here. If it were up to me, I am prepared to use some \\npretty direct ways to get the money into the trust fund. I \\nthink that is what we should do. But I want to make sure that \\nwe accomplish, by the end of next month, a 6-year \\nreauthorization that not only allows us to maintain the Federal \\npartnership, but to meet the needs that are out there.\\n    And I would just urge us to take a look at some of these \\nnumbers that Joint Tax has come back with on the international \\ntax side. They are well beyond the revenues necessary to \\naccomplish these goals. The monies are there. And, by the way, \\nwe unleash additional activity here in the United States. We \\nwill not get credit for that in the scoring. I understand that. \\nBut when we bring the money from foreign corporations back into \\nthe United States, that is going to generate more economic \\nactivity here, which is going to also produce more revenues for \\nthis country.\\n    So I think there are ways that we can work together, \\nDemocrats and Republicans, to do it, but we must be committed \\nto this goal. We cannot let this July date go without a 6-year \\nreauthorization, and the level has to be adequate to deal with \\nthe growing transportation needs in this country--enough \\npermanent revenues so we do not create a cliff and creative \\nuses of one-time-only revenues. And my colleague Senator Warner \\nhas recommendations on how we can use one-time-only seed money \\nto supplement the transportation program.\\n    That is the creative way that we can get Democrats and \\nRepublicans together, but I would just urge all of us--and I \\nserve on the Environment and Public Works Committee, and we are \\nworking in a bipartisan way for a 6-year reauthorization, and I \\nknow the Banking Committee is also working on this area. We \\ncannot let next month go without accomplishing those goals. And \\nI understand the political realities. Let us, though, not lose \\nthis opportunity, because if we do, you are putting the \\ncitizens of Maryland at risk on the safety projects that are \\nnot being done. You are putting the people of Maryland at risk \\nfor the economic opportunities in western Maryland that will \\nnot be done. And you are putting us at risk every time we spend \\n2 hours trying to go 2 miles in this region in order to be able \\nto get from our home to work. We can do better for the American \\npeople.\\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator. Let me just say this: I \\nam for a multiyear resolution here, whether it is 2, 3, 4, 5, \\nor 6. We are going to have to live with reality. But I am for \\ngetting this done, and we will see what we can do.\\n    Senator Warner, you are next.\\n    Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have been \\nchomping at the bit.\\n    First of all, I want to say, Secretary LaHood, when you \\nmentioned ports, you said only two ports in America are ready, \\npost-Panamax, one of them in Virginia.\\n    Secondly, Mr. Moore, you and I have had lots of back and \\nforth over the years, Governor and Senator, but I do find--and \\nSenator Menendez has already raised this. You know, we might \\nhave never built an Interstate Highway System because there was \\nmassive wealth transfer from certain States to less populous \\nStates over 40 years, and suddenly to say now that it is built \\nwe are going to go to devolution, I think is not an appropriate \\napproach.\\n    Number three, I very much appreciate what you are doing, \\nMr. Chairman, and next week I know we are going to have a \\nfinancing issue. I simply want to indicate that we have, I \\nthink, a very \\nbusiness-focused financing vehicle that we reintroduced \\nyesterday called The BRIDGE Act. We have 11 original \\ncosponsors--5 Republicans, 6 Democrats. It would generate $300 \\nbillion-plus in financing. Financing is not a silver bullet, \\nbut it has a business background, unlike some of the other \\nproposals that have been put forward. And I hope it gets \\nserious consideration because--let us bear in mind, vis-a-vis \\nour competition, China is putting together a $100-billion \\ninfrastructure bank. The fact that we have in our government \\nright now an office in the United States Treasury that advises \\nAmerican pension funds on how to invest in European and foreign \\ninfrastructure, because there is no ability for American \\npension funds to invest in a broad way in American \\ninfrastructure, is ludicrous. And at record-low interest rates, \\nwe, I think, do not take up that option at our peril.\\n    I wish Senator Thune was still here, because I support \\nrepatriation, but I do believe that we are going to have a hard \\ntime saying to our domestic companies that we have just given \\nmultinationals whatever blended rate, and they are still paying \\n35 percent. And where I have, Mr. Chairman, enormous, enormous \\nrespect for you, I do not think we can start with the premise \\nthat we cannot generate new revenues.\\n    Senator Thune, I think, was open to this. Senator Thune \\nmentioned the fact that we are borrowing. We are having a \\ndebate right now about, you know, the funny money around \\nOverseas Contingency Operations. If we had not had to transfer \\n$56 billion from the general fund into the Highway Trust Fund, \\nwe would have a sufficient amount to plus-up on defense or on \\nthe domestic side without such borrowing techniques. But \\nremember, this is robbing Peter to pay Paul in our current \\napproach.\\n    I do think there are some ideas that a number of us, in a \\nbipartisan way, are looking at that maybe have not been in the \\nfull debate yet that would look, Mr. Chairman, at revenues, but \\nin a way that would be phased in over a period of time, that \\nwould not be disruptive to the economy or, frankly, disruptive \\nto any of us who have to run in 2016.\\n    So again, I just ask you, because I know you are always, I \\nthink, willing to take a broad-based look. Let us not take \\nthings off the table before we start this discussion. We are \\nall willing to give some, but revenues--I have not met anyone, \\nechoing Secretary LaHood and all the folks involved in the \\nbusiness side, who thinks that we can borrow our way one time \\ninto fixing our infrastructure needs without an ongoing, \\npermanent revenue source.\\n    And that will bring me to my question, and I am going to \\nactually go to Dr. Kile, since you seem to have been left out \\nof a lot of these questions. Your projections over the next 10 \\nyears, I think, are good and sobering, but the irony, of \\ncourse, here is that we have two policy constraints \\ncontradicting each other. We have a gas tax, but we have \\nincreasing fuel efficiency standards. Have you looked beyond \\nthe 10-year window in terms of how much further the existing \\nrevenue source of the gas tax decreases as fuel efficiency \\ncontinues to improve? And I support electric vehicles or \\nnatural gas vehicles. But the fact is, as our fleet becomes \\nmore distributed, what that completely does is further hollow \\nout the Highway Trust Fund.\\n    Dr. Kile. Senator, we have a report on that that I do not \\nhave on the tip of my tongue that I will be happy to send to \\nyou. Over time, the increase in vehicle efficiency does erode \\nthe revenues into the trust fund, both within the window and \\nbeyond it.\\n    Senator Warner. I will close up with this and not go over \\nmy time, but to my Republican colleagues, we also have in our \\nfinancing approach--and, again, financing does not solve the \\nwindow. You have to still pay it back. It often translates to \\ntolls. But one of the things that we also include is--time is \\nmoney--and we put in a provision for an expedited National \\nEnvironmental Policy Act process, one of the things that \\nactually Mr. Moore and I would agree on. As a former Governor, \\nyou know, it should not take 7 years to do a NEPA review before \\nyou build any project. And I would be anxious to talk with all \\nof my Republican colleagues to join the five or so other \\nRepublicans who have already joined in this effort.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    The Chairman. Thank you.\\n    Senator Brown, you are next.\\n    Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for \\njoining us.\\n    Secretary LaHood, I would like to address my comments, \\nbrief comments, and questions to you. You know, when we look at \\nsort of the post-World War II history of our country, we know \\nthat in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and into the 1980s we \\nhad the greatest infrastructure the world had ever seen. Yet \\ntoday, when we think about what our parents and grandparents \\nbequeathed to us, this incredible infrastructure, we have \\nfailed to modernize it, we have failed to upgrade it, and we \\nhave really failed to maintain it. We have problems in States \\nwhere--in my State, as an example, but other States too--State \\ngovernment has cut funding to local communities. So, we see the \\ncondition of our infrastructure and what it means to \\neverything. We know that the Brent Spence Bridge, a huge \\ninfrastructure project, mostly in the State of Kentucky \\ntechnically, but across the Ohio River, carries 4 percent of \\nGDP every day across that bridge because it is I-75 going from \\nDetroit south.\\n    But it seems we are making this whole--and I have watched \\nsome of the questions and comments. It seems we are making this \\nmore complicated than it has to be. There is a bipartisan \\nproposal you know about, Mr. Secretary. We can fund a 6-year \\nbill at the level that a 21st-century infrastructure system \\ndemands without raising taxes on small business owners and \\nworking families. We can reform our international corporate tax \\nsystem to make it more competitive, shut down tax havens, grow \\ninvestment in the United States. We can use a one-time \\nmandatory tax on those overseas earnings. Not to, again, as we \\ndo it, encourage more companies to go overseas, but do a deemed \\nrepatriation with a lower tax rate that would be ongoing so \\ncompanies would act differently.\\n    Talk about that, why we should move to something like that. \\nWe have seen some support in both parties. We have seen \\nadministration support. Does that make sense to get us where we \\nneed to go?\\n    Mr. LaHood. You are all very, very astute lawmakers, and I \\nthink you are going to have an awful lot of heartburn from the \\nbusiness community to move in that direction. They are the ones \\nwho are putting this money offshore. They have their own ideas \\nhow they want to use their money, and I do not know if every \\none of these companies is going to want to use their money to \\npay for infrastructure. They have lots of other ideas. And so I \\nthink you are going to get a lot of pushback.\\n    But I will say what I said earlier to the chairman. Put it \\non the table. See how much revenue you can get from it. See how \\nmuch pushback you get, and if you can include it, do it, \\nbecause it is a good pot of money.\\n    But I would also urge you--and I heard what the chairman \\nsaid, and I know there are people on the other side of the \\nRotunda who have said absolutely no increase in the gas tax. \\nThat has to be on the table. That is the pot of money that \\nbuilt America, and that is the pot of money that can rebuild \\nAmerica again. Why should we turn a blind eye to the pot of \\nmoney that built our country? Ronald Reagan raised the gas tax. \\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush under reconciliation raised the gas \\ntax. Bill Clinton raised the gas tax. It has not been raised in \\n20 years. Stamps have gone up, eggs have gone up, milk has gone \\nup, cars have gone up. Everything in America has gone up except \\nthe gas tax. If it had been indexed in 1993, we would not be \\nhaving this debate. So think about indexing it.\\n    So my answer is, if you can get some repatriated funds, \\ntake a look at it. I do not think the business community is \\ngoing to be all that gung-ho about it, but, you know, maybe you \\ndo not take it all. Maybe you give them some kind of a tax \\nbreak. But do not take the gas tax off the table, Mr. Chairman. \\nPlease do not.\\n    Senator Brown. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    The Chairman. Senator Isakson, you are next.\\n    Senator Isakson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Chairman, I was just thinking, I think you and I are \\nthe only two people in the room old enough to remember before \\nthere was an interstate highway system. I was born in 1944, and \\nwe have all talked about the interstate highway system. But the \\nreason Eisenhower proposed it was to evacuate the major \\npopulation centers in the event of a nuclear attack because of \\nNagasaki and Hiroshima. It became the greatest economic \\ncatalyst for growth, and it created the new South. Atlanta \\nwould not be Atlanta and Florida certainly would not be Florida \\nif it was not for the interstate highway system, because nobody \\ncould get there. All those Yankees moved south, and we made a \\nlot of money. [Laughter.] We gave them a way to do that.\\n    But my point is this--and Mr. Moore made the point about \\nthe pro-growth tax policy. Transportation improvements are pro-\\ngrowth, and, if you expand prosperity, you raise revenue, not \\nby raising rates but by raising economic activity. And I think \\nMr. Moore referred to that and recognized that there is a role \\nfor a gas tax at the Federal level, but not as the sole answer, \\nnot as the sole solution.\\n    I agree with Secretary LaHood, and I agree with you, Mr. \\nChairman. We have to put everything on the table and stop \\ntalking at each other and by each other and start talking to \\neach other.\\n    At one point in time in this room today, in this hearing--\\nand Senator Coats is right: every potential solution in \\ncollection has been mentioned. All we have to do is pull the \\ntrigger. And, if we pull the trigger, not by picking them off \\none at a time like ducks in a shooting gallery, but instead \\nputting all the ducks in the tub and saying, okay, what is the \\nbest formula to make transportation work in the 21st century, \\nto raise prosperity, to make ease of transit easier, and to \\nexpand our opportunities, we have the chance to do it. But if \\nwe try to find one place to do it, we are going to make a \\nserious mistake.\\n    Now, Secretary LaHood, it was a privilege and pleasure for \\nme to serve with you in Congress and on the Transportation \\nCommittee. I have one loaded question for you. You are the only \\nformer Secretary of Transportation in the room and a former \\nmember of Congress. In talking about economic growth and \\nopportunity, there is a lot to be said about fast-tracking road \\nconstruction in the United States and breaking away the \\nlabyrinth of time-consuming regulations of the Federal \\nGovernment. As a former Secretary of Transportation and as a \\nformer member of Congress--and as one advocating road \\nimprovements--do you not think part of this reform that gets us \\nrevenue ought to be less cost of Federal regulations and \\nFederal delays in building roads in our States?\\n    Mr. LaHood. Absolutely. And it can be done at the \\nDepartment; it can be done at the Secretary\\'s office. I met \\nwith every Governor in the country. We knew every Secretary of \\nTransportation in the country. We worked with them day in and \\nday out. They were our best partners. And when they brought \\negregious regulations and rules to us that did not make any \\nsense, we tried to get them changed to speed up the process so \\npeople could go to work and roads could be built. And it is \\npossible and should be done.\\n    Senator Isakson. And, if we do put everything on the table \\nto solve the crisis--and it is a crisis that we are facing \\nright now in terms of our Highway Trust Fund--should that not \\nbe one of the things we consider to contribute to the solution?\\n    Mr. LaHood. Absolutely. It should be a part of the bill. \\nFind the things that are egregious and get rid of them.\\n    Senator Isakson. I rest my case, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.\\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\\n    Senator Stabenow?\\n    Senator Stabenow. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. \\nI think this has actually been a very, very good discussion, \\nand I thank you. And I think the majority of us are saying that \\nwe want to get something done. We have 43 days, and in \\nlegislative time that is a long time, if people really want to \\nget things done.\\n    Let me start out by saying, Mr. Moore, I am really glad \\nthat, when I was doing the farm bill, our colleagues in urban \\nStates did not share your view about not caring what happens in \\nother States, because the western States were huge \\nbeneficiaries. Our livestock disaster assistance program is \\nabsolutely critical, and on the transportation front, short \\nrail for agriculture is absolutely critical but does not go \\nthrough every State. And so we really are in this together as a \\ncountry, and there are things that certainly we do better at \\nthe State and local level. But we are in this as a country, and \\nin Agriculture, I sure saw that, with a lot of my colleagues \\nsaying, ``I do not have a lot of farmers. Why should I care?\\'\\' \\nBut you eat, and so you should care. So we all are connected in \\nsome way, and I think we have to keep that in mind.\\n    Mr. Chairman, I also think that we are coming to terms with \\nwhat has been years now of trying to pretend we do not have to \\npay our bills and do not have to pay for things. And I am all \\nfor streamlining and looking for better ways to do things. \\nAgain, I have to say, going back to the farm bill, we cut 100 \\ndifferent programs that were duplications or did not work and \\nactually saved $23 billion in total, and then we increased the \\nthings that were working. So I am all for doing that. But it \\ndoes not take the place of paying our bills. And it does not \\nmatter whether it was President Eisenhower talking about \\nnational defense and transportation equaling economic defense, \\nbringing that together, or whether it is the chairman of the \\nEPW Committee, Senator Inhofe, whom I greatly respect on this \\nissue, who has said that both the Department of Defense and \\ninfrastructure are absolutely critical responsibilities of the \\nFederal Government. And I appreciate what he and Senator Boxer \\nare doing to bring forth a robust 6-year bill, which it is our \\nresponsibility to figure out how to fund.\\n    And I do not in any way pretend this is not challenging. \\nBut I also know there are multiple ways to do it and that, if \\nwe all decide that this is important for jobs and economic \\ngrowth and all the other things that have been talked about \\ntoday, as well as just saying to people that they are not going \\nto have to pay for their roads by a realignment of their car--I \\ntalked to one constituent of mine who had to buy seven new \\ntires last year. He said, ``Please, there has to be a cheaper \\nway to fund what is happening here in terms of highways than my \\ncontinuing to buy new tires or get my car realigned,\\'\\' which I \\nhad to do just by taking the vehicle I have here back to \\nMichigan for a month last fall. I had to pay for an entire \\nrealignment. So, please, there are certainly cheaper ways to \\npay for that than what constituents, all of us, are doing right \\nnow.\\n    So, Mr. Chairman, I think, while we are talking about the \\nbig push on trade, not to understand the infrastructure needs \\nthat relate to effectively exporting our products makes no \\nsense. I would love to see the same focused, bipartisan push on \\ninfrastructure, on jobs, roads, bridges, rail, airports, ports, \\nand so on, that we have seen in this major push on trade. And \\nmaybe we ought to put them together. Maybe we ought to actually \\nsay we are going to make sure that we have the millions of \\njobs, American jobs, that come from that and the infrastructure \\nto be able to actually do this.\\n    I want to share one other thing with colleagues. As a \\nnorthern State that has the largest border crossing in the \\nnorth, which is through Detroit to Windsor, we saw what \\nhappened after 9/11 when we temporarily had to shut that down. \\nOver $1 billion--I think it is $1.3 billion in goods that cross \\nevery single day back and forth, not counting people who are \\nworking going back and forth. And we realized that we needed to \\nhave a second bridge, both for national security as well as for \\neconomic reasons. And, Secretary LaHood, thank you for being \\nsuch a wonderful partner with us, a terrific, important partner \\nfor us in Detroit and in Michigan and in doing a whole range of \\nthings, but certainly the bridge.\\n    What is still terribly embarrassing to me is that the only \\nway we could get the bridge done is for the Canadians to \\ncompletely finance it. Now, they have something called a \\n``P3,\\'\\' a public-private partnership, and they are financing \\nthe bridge, because America could not come up with part of it \\nto finance a bridge that we desperately need to have. And then \\non top of that, we could not even produce the money for the \\nCustoms plaza on our side, because we do not have the \\nbipartisan will to fund infrastructure in our country. So the \\nCanadians are doing that too, Mr. Chairman.\\n    And so I would hope that we could take this moment of \\nopportunities--we have 43 days, and, Mr. Chairman, we are \\nwilling to work night and day with you on a bipartisan basis to \\nstep up and decide we are really going to invest in the future, \\nwe are going to take that next step, we are going to decide to \\ntruly pay our bills, not send it on to our kids in the form of \\ndeficits, but actually step up and do something that everybody \\ntells their kids they ought to do, which is work hard and pay \\nyour bills and make good decisions. And we can do that, and we \\nhave 43 days to do it, and I certainly hope that we are going \\nto be able to get it done.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\\n    We will turn to Senator Casey now.\\n    Senator Casey. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and I \\nappreciate you having this hearing, and I appreciate the focus \\nyou have brought on this issue to get a bipartisan solution. I \\nthink it is good we have some passion here.\\n    The chairman exhibits passion on some things. He is from \\nPittsburgh, so he has Pennsylvania in him, and we appreciate \\nthat. We need more than just talk in this. We need to get folks \\ntogether in a bipartisan fashion.\\n    One area that is of particular concern to me as a \\nPennsylvanian--and I think it is true of a number of States, \\nand maybe unfortunately is most emblematic of the challenges we \\nhave--is our bridges and the number of structurally deficient \\nbridges. We have in our State over 5,000 at last count. I am \\njust looking at some other States, and these are not east coast \\nStates. Oklahoma has, at last count--these are December 2014 \\nnumbers from the Federal Highway Administration--4,216; \\nMissouri, 3,310; Iowa is similar to Pennsylvania, over 5,000. \\nSo it is a huge issue. I know, Mr. Moore, in your testimony you \\nsaid the number had come down, and we are at about 10 percent \\nnationally. It is right around that percentage. But it is very \\nhigh in some States, and we have a major challenge.\\n    So I guess, Secretary LaHood, I would start with you, and, \\nin addition to your testimony today and your passion, we \\nappreciate the work you have put into this as a public \\nofficial, as Secretary, and now as a citizen. And I want to ask \\nyou about just that challenge alone: the challenge of our \\nbridges.\\n    And then, second, to reference a part of your testimony, I \\nthink it was on the top of page 4, you cite there the impact on \\na family budget would be a little more than $1,000. Talk about \\nthat in terms of the impact on families, the overall \\ntransportation challenge, but specifically the----\\n    Mr. LaHood. Well, first of all, Senator, thanks for all \\nyour leadership in Pennsylvania. During our time, we were able \\nto get a lot of really good things done for the people of \\nPennsylvania.\\n    I think that the reality is that every one of these bridges \\nthat is deficient and in a state of bad repair was built under \\nthe interstate system. So we owe it to the Commonwealth of \\nPennsylvania and every other State to have a national program \\nto fix up our bridges. And we are not going to do it with the \\nresources we have now because they are not there.\\n    So, again, I know you all have the tough job of finding the \\nmoney, but we need to find the money so that people are not \\nfearful of crossing bridges in the Commonwealth or in any other \\nState in our country. And some people are fearful of crossing \\nbridges. People have seen the ``60 Minutes\\'\\' report where \\nformer Governor Rendell is standing under a bridge with Steve \\nKroft, and it is falling down. The bridge that connects \\nArlington Cemetery to the District of Columbia, it is in a \\nterrible state of repair. Underneath, the girders are \\ncrumbling. Where is the money to fix it? That is what we need \\nto do.\\n    With respect to revenue-raising opportunities, you know, I \\nmentioned what happens with the gas tax. It does not stay here \\nin Washington. It goes back to the Governors and the State \\nDOTs, and they spend it, and they put it back into the American \\nworker, the ones who are fixing the roads and bridges. And that \\nhelps them. The highest segment of unemployment in America \\ntoday is in the building trades, people who build roads and \\nbridges. And they are middle-income people, and they are out of \\nwork. They are waiting for Congress to take action.\\n    We need to have some leadership here and some vision and \\nsome courage to say, this is what we have to do to help the \\nAmerican people, to help our country. So I do not see the \\nincrease in the gas tax as an impingement on middle-income \\npeople. I see it helping a lot of middle-income people who are \\nbuilding the roads and bridges.\\n    Senator Casey. I would also say, in reference to just the \\nterminology here, when you talk about structurally deficient, \\npart of that definition is ``significant defect.\\'\\' So in some \\nplaces it may mean that they are a long way from something \\nactually collapsing, but in your experience as Secretary, I \\nguess there is also a segment of that which would be much more \\ngrave.\\n    Mr. LaHood. That is right, and we work with the State DOTs, \\nand they actually have to do--you know, they have closed some \\nbridges because people cannot travel on them.\\n    The Chairman. Senator, your time is up. Senator Carper, you \\nare next.\\n    Senator Carper. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. To our witnesses, \\nwelcome one and all. Great to see you. And, Mr. Secretary, I am \\nespecially happy to see you again.\\n    Mr. Chairman, I would like to cite a statement by the \\nAmerican Road and Transportation Builders Association. The \\ngroup study in 2014 looked at reelection rates of State \\nlegislators who voted for increases in user fees to fund \\ntransportation projects in their States, and they found that, \\nsurprisingly to a lot of folks, 95 percent of the Republicans \\nwho voted to do that in their States won their primaries. They \\nwon their general elections. They were reelected. That is a \\nhigher percentage than those who voted not to raise those user \\nfees. On the Democratic side, it turns out, in the last year in \\nthose half-dozen or so States, 90 percent of the Democrats who \\nvoted to raise the user fees for transportation projects were \\nreelected. That is more than the percent who voted against \\nthem.\\n    I was Governor for 8 years, and three times during those 8 \\nyears I called for raising user fees. We created a \\ntransportation trust fund. We did not just finance it, we did \\nnot just borrow money. We actually leveraged that money to fund \\nour improvements. But three times during my time as Governor, I \\nsaid, let us raise the user fees--not by a dollar, not by half \\na dollar or 25 cents, but let us raise them. And I ran for \\nreelection, and I won. I only won by 70 percent, so it did not \\nhurt me too badly. And then in 2000, I ran for the U.S. Senate \\nagainst a fellow who was the chairman of this committee, and I \\nwon there too. But when the Bowles-Simpson Commission was \\nformed, George Voinovich and I suggested that the Bowles-\\nSimpson Commission--the Commission reached out and they said, \\ngive us ideas for reducing our deficits, and Voinovich and I \\nput together a letter that said, ``Why don\\'t we raise the gas \\nand diesel tax by a penny a month for 25 months?\\'\\' A penny a \\nmonth for 25 months, with 10 cents for deficit reduction, 15 \\ncents for infrastructure.\\n    The very next day--the very next day--it leaked. This \\nletter leaked, and it was a news story. And one of my \\nRepublican colleagues said to me, he said, ``You have just \\nwritten your first 30-second commercial to be used against you \\nwhen you run for reelection next time.\\'\\' You know what? He was \\nright. And I won by 70 percent.\\n    I mean, you can make these tough decisions. People want us \\nto do stuff, and actually they are looking to us to provide, as \\nyou say, Mr. Secretary, some leadership and some courage. And \\nif you do, you do not get punished for it. You get rewarded. \\nYou get rewarded.\\n    And this idea that the States want us to devolve this stuff \\nback to them--I was chairman of the National Governors \\nAssociation for a while. I was a leader at the NGA for the \\nbetter part of 8 years. I loved doing that job--loved doing \\nthat job. But we never came to the Congress and said, ``Get out \\nof our way. We can handle all this.\\'\\' We never did that.\\n    In fact, I got a letter last month from the NGA that said \\njust the opposite. I do not think I have the actual quote here, \\nbut maybe I do. Here is what the NGA said to us last month: \\n``We believe that a commitment to surface transportation at all \\nlevels of government is necessary and that each level, \\nincluding the Federal Government, has a crucial role to play to \\nachieve overall success and keep America competitive in the \\n21st-century economy.\\'\\'\\n    I live in a little State. We have New Jersey to the east, \\nPennsylvania to the north, and Maryland to the west. We do not \\njust build transportation systems to meet our needs in our \\nState. We are a region, and we are part of a country. I had a \\nmeeting this morning with a manufacturing group, and they said, \\n``Please do something on transportation. For God\\'s sake, do \\nsomething on transportation.\\'\\' I said, ``Give me a good example \\nof why you need it.\\'\\' And we were talking about trade in that \\nmeeting, and I am a big advocate of the President\\'s proposal, \\nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership. But this one fellow said, ``We \\nexport a lot of what we make, and we have a window of time when \\nwe can get our goods or products to a port when a ship is \\nthere. We have a short window. They are in and they are out, \\nand if we do not meet that window, then we lose out.\\'\\' And he \\nsaid, ``For God\\'s sake, give us a chance, a fighting chance to \\nget our goods, our products, to that port so that we can make \\nthe window.\\'\\'\\n    Here is my question--enough proselytizing from me. Dr. \\nKile, for you, some people think that we can finance our way \\nout of this and we do not have to fund our way out of this. And \\nI think funding has to be part of it. And financing obviously \\nmakes some sense. People get confused when we talk about how we \\nwill just finance our way out of this. What do you think? And \\nin the Navy, we used to talk about the straight skinny. Give us \\nthe straight skinny. Is this something we can do just by \\nfinancing our way out of it?\\n    Dr. Kile. Well, Senator, ultimately that is a choice for \\nyou and your colleagues. The way I think of funding is coming \\nup with a set of revenues to pay for a set of highway spending \\nthat would be desirable. And the amount of that is a choice for \\nyou and your colleagues. And then financing is a way of \\nencouraging borrowing by State and local governments or others, \\nor the Federal Government if it is Federal spending, to pay for \\nhighways. But those are ultimately not sources of revenues and \\nwould be a call ultimately on future taxpayers or future users \\nof the system.\\n    Senator Carper. All right. Mr. Chairman, could I have 30 \\nmore seconds?\\n    The Chairman. Sure.\\n    Senator Carper. I just want 30 more seconds, if I could. I \\ndo not think we are going to raise the gas tax by a penny a \\nmonth for 25 months. We are not going to raise it a penny a \\nquarter for 25 quarters or even 15 quarters. At the end of the \\nday, we may do something that the President is calling for, \\nwhich is international tax reform, and out of that deem some of \\nthe money that is held overseas to be brought back and used for \\ninfrastructure. If that happens, that is terrific. But if it \\ndoes not happen, we need to do something. And if someone was \\ngoing to suggest a way to do something, to do it gradually over \\na period of time, that would include indexing the gas and \\ndiesel tax. I think at the very least we can do that, and we \\nshould do that. And the key is leadership. We need leadership \\nhere, and that includes all of us here in this room.\\n    Thank you.\\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.\\n    One last Senator, and then maybe I will have a question. \\nSenator Heller?\\n    Senator Heller. All right. Saving the best for last, Mr. \\nChairman. Thanks for having this hearing, and thanks for all \\nyour hard work. I know this is not an easy topic. We have heard \\nsome great ideas here, and we have some great witnesses here \\nalso. Thanks for taking the time. I know it has been a long day \\nfor you, and I will try to finish this up on a positive note.\\n    Myself and Senator Bennet from Colorado have been working \\non the chairman\\'s subcommittee, the working group on \\ninfrastructure, and these are the conversations we have had for \\nthe last 3 months, Mr. Chairman. You can imagine the \\nconversations going on once a week similar to this, and as hard \\nas Senator Bennet and I and the members of that working group \\nhave worked on this, I know our staffs have worked just as \\nhard, if not harder, to try to solve this problem.\\n    Last month, we had Transportation Secretary Foxx in the \\noffice, also with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, having this very \\nconversation that we are having today. And I guess one topic \\nthat we are not talking about, quite to the fullest extent \\nanyway, is: what are the needs? What do we actually need? We \\nare talking, Mr. Chairman, in most discussions about maybe $10 \\nto $12 billion a year for the next 5 or 6 years. But if you sit \\ndown with the Treasury Secretary and Secretary Foxx--and I \\nassume the former Secretary of Transportation could give us \\nsome insight on this--what are the needs?\\n    Let me tell you why I say that. The two largest urban areas \\nin America that do not have a freeway between them are Las \\nVegas and Phoenix. Now, you can imagine the impact economically \\nthat would have for those two communities if we had enough \\nmoney to put a new freeway between those two cities. The \\nproblem is, we have not added a new highway in this country for \\n25 years--25 years. So are the needs $10 to $12 billion a year \\nso that we are talking $60, $70, $80 billion over 6 years? Or \\nare the real needs $100 billion, $200 billion, or $300 billion \\nso that we can actually solve the problems?\\n    If we are going to go $10, $12 billion a year, all we are \\ndoing is keeping our head above water. That is it: head above \\nwater. Fix the potholes, you know, and it would do good work. \\nIt would help with some of these roads. It would help with \\nthese bridges, and I am all for it. But if we want to expand, \\nand if we want to expand economic growth--and, Secretary \\nLaHood, you said short-term jobs, long-term economic growth. \\nShort-term jobs, long-term economic growth. What we need is a \\ngood transportation program here in the State.\\n    Now, I believe that there are three things the Federal \\nGovernment does, and one is defense. You know, we are going to \\nwork on defense today; I think we are going to pass out of the \\nUnited States Senate our NDAA budget. There we go. We have hit \\nnational defense. But number two is infrastructure. So here we \\nare, national defense, infrastructure, and, frankly, I would \\nadd a third, and that is a safety net for those who need it.\\n    But we have an opportunity here in the next 45 days to make \\na real difference--a real difference here for this country; \\nagain, short-term jobs, long-term growth.\\n    So I guess the question I have is: what are the real needs? \\nIs it $10, $12 billion a year? Is it closer to $200 billion? If \\nyou talk to the administration, they say it is closer to $300 \\nbillion if you really want to expand the infrastructure we \\nhave. I will start with the CBO on this.\\n    Dr. Kile. Thank you. Several years back, CBO did an \\nanalysis of some work by FHWA, and we found at the time that in \\norder to maintain current surfaces, spending would need to rise \\nby a few tens of billions of dollars per year from the current \\nlevel, and that the number of projects that would be \\njustifiable on a benefit-cost basis would be somewhat higher \\nthan that. That was based on a several-years-old analysis, but \\nI think the sign of that answer would be the same.\\n    Senator Heller. Okay. I want to hear from the former \\nTransportation Secretary.\\n    Mr. LaHood. The answer is $300 to $500 billion to get us \\nback to being number one in infrastructure, to get the road \\nbetween Las Vegas and Phoenix, to do some of the other things \\nthat need to be done on the interstate system, to fix up the \\nthousands of bridges that are in a state of bad repair, to \\nreally make progress. We just need a lot of money, and, you \\nknow, we are talking sort of around the edges here in terms of, \\nas you put it, just keeping our head above water. It is still a \\nlot of money.\\n    Senator Heller. It is. It is.\\n    Mr. LaHood. But to get back to being number one, it is an \\nenormous amount of money, $300 to $500 billion.\\n    Senator Heller. Okay. Mr. Moore, is it my understanding \\nthat in your testimony you said funding the Federal highway \\nsystem is done? Did I understand that correctly?\\n    Mr. Moore. I am glad you asked this question, because there \\nhas been some misunderstanding about what I have said about the \\nFederal interstate highway system.\\n    First of all, I am a huge fan of what Eisenhower did in the \\n1950s. The Secretary is exactly right. It was a huge, huge \\neconomic boon to the country that connected us through a \\ntransportation infrastructure that was second to none in the \\nworld. So let there be no misunderstanding about that. It was \\nan incredibly important economic development project that has \\npaid dividends for a century.\\n    What I am saying is, there is a big difference between the \\nFederal Government funding interstate transportation and inner-\\nState transportation. It is extremely inefficient for the \\nUnited States Federal Government to determine what inner-State, \\nwithin-State transportation projects should be funded. Those \\nshould be funded by the people who are going to use them.\\n    With all due respect to the Secretary----\\n    Senator Heller. I am out of time. Mr. Moore, are you \\narguing against a freeway between Las Vegas and Phoenix?\\n    Mr. Moore. No, look, I think--I do not know----\\n    Senator Heller. Who would then pay for that? Who would pay \\nfor that?\\n    Mr. Moore. Who would pay for it? I think that--if it is \\nsomething that is needed in our interstate highway system, it \\nshould be paid by Federal taxpayers. I do not know the \\nspecifics about that particular road, but I think the one \\ndisagreement that the Secretary and I have is, I do not believe \\nwe need to spend more money on infrastructure. What we need to \\ndo is spend more wisely on infrastructure, because we are \\nwasting tens of billions of dollars a year on projects that \\nnever should have been funded and that are only funded because \\nStates are getting money from people out of State to finance \\nthem. And Virginia is a perfect example. The Silver Line, which \\nis a huge waste of money, I am going to have to pay for that \\nnow through the tolls that I pay on the toll road. That never \\nwould have been funded except for the fact that the people out \\nof the State of Virginia, around the country, and in your State \\nof Nevada have to pay taxes for that. That is not fair. We have \\nto move back to a--and, in fact, Mr. Chairman, as you determine \\nwhat is the best way to fund these important infrastructure \\nprojects over the next 6 years, I hope you will keep this in \\nmind. User pays. The single best way to make sure we are \\nefficient with our transportation infrastructure is to make \\nsure the user who is going to make use of these projects is the \\none who pays for them.\\n    Senator Heller. Mr. Chairman, thank you. My time has run \\nout, but thank you for all you are doing on this particular \\ntopic.\\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you.\\n    Let me just end this hearing. I am very appreciative of all \\nthree of you being here. Mr. LaHood, for a while there I \\nthought you were going to have a heart attack. [Laughter.] I \\nwas worried about it. We need you too badly.\\n    But let me just say this: one thing that bothers me a \\nlittle bit is the administration\\'s view of the gas tax as a \\nsource of revenue. The Obama administration has never included \\na gas tax increase in any of their budgets, and their current \\npay-for for infrastructure is essentially international tax \\nreform, which has all kinds of problems. I am looking at it \\nwith everything I\\'ve got, but there are all kinds of problems, \\nand it just bothers me that the administration has not sought \\nto increase the gas tax if it is that important. But I do not \\nwant to waste your time today on that.\\n    All I can say is this: as chairman of this committee, I \\nintend to solve this problem. It is almost insoluble under \\ncurrent circumstances. All of my Democrat friends want to spend \\nany amount of money, increase taxes and so forth, and all at \\nthe same time that we are totally out of money and are in such \\ndebt that now Joint Tax and CBO are both saying that we cannot \\ncontinue the way we are going. It is a very, very serious set \\nof problems for me, and I think it should be for everybody. I \\nwould like to solve this problem, and I am going to solve it \\none way or the other, if it is only on a multiyear basis. And \\nif I can solve it on a long-term basis, I will see what I can \\ndo, though I am not the sole person who has to work on this, \\nand I appreciate the colleagues who are helping me and continue \\nto help me in a bipartisan way on this committee.\\n    So, having said that, let me just once again thank the \\nthree of you for being here, for appearing here today, and all \\nof our colleagues who have participated. As you can see, this \\nis a very participatory committee. It drives me nuts sometimes. \\n[Laughter.]\\n    I think we have had an informative discussion that will \\ngive us a lot to think about as we tackle these very, very \\nessential and important problems.\\n    I would ask that any written questions anybody on the \\ncommittee wants to give for the record be submitted by Monday, \\nJune 22nd. And with that, I want to thank you again, and----\\n    Senator Carper. Mr. Chairman? Could I have maybe one more \\nminute? Would you mind?\\n    The Chairman. I will give you another minute.\\n    Senator Carper. That would be great. Thanks so much.\\n    The Chairman. I just want to let you know that I appreciate \\nyou.\\n    Senator Carper. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Thomas Jefferson used to say, ``If the people know the \\ntruth, they will not make a mistake.\\'\\'\\n    The Chairman. That is right.\\n    Senator Carper. The truth is our roads, highways, bridges, \\nour transit systems are in bad shape and getting worse.\\n    Another truth is, if things are worth having, they are \\nworth paying for. Historically, we have paid for transportation \\nthrough user fees. I am happy to support that. If somebody can \\ncome up with a better idea, I am happy to support that as well. \\nAt the end of the day, we need to do something.\\n    Leadership has been described as having the courage to stay \\nout of step when everybody else is marching to the wrong tune. \\nThe wrong tune is to do nothing. The wrong tune is to kick the \\ncan down the road like we have done 12 times over the last 5 \\nyears. The wrong thing to do is to have stop-and-go funding for \\nthese projects. And I can tell you, as an old Governor, that if \\nyou do not know for certain the money is going to be there, we \\nwaste a huge amount of money.\\n    And I would just say to you, Mr. Moore, when I was \\nGovernor, I vetoed a Davis-Bacon law, and I also called for \\nincreases in user fees to pay for these things. I am willing to \\nmake some tough choices to get this done. We have to get this \\ndone.\\n    Thank you.\\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you, Senator. I appreciate you \\nvery much. I really do appreciate having this hearing. We are \\ngoing to try to solve this problem. Right now it looks almost \\ninsoluble with both Houses, but we will see what we can do.\\n    Thanks again for being here. With that, we will recess \\nuntil further notice.\\n    [Whereupon, at 12:09 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]\\n\\n                            A P P E N D I X\\n\\n              Additional Material Submitted for the Record\\n\\n                              ----------                              \\n\\n\\n              Prepared Statement of Hon. Orrin G. Hatch, \\n                        a U.S. Senator From Utah\\nWASHINGTON--Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) \\ntoday delivered the following opening statement at a Committee hearing \\nexamining responsible and sustainable funding options for the Highway \\nTrust Fund:\\n\\n    Good morning, everyone. Today, we will be discussing the challenges \\nCongress faces as we work to provide funding for the federal Highway \\nTrust Fund.\\n\\n    Right now, when it comes to highways, we find ourselves caught in a \\nfamiliar dilemma, between raising taxes or cutting back on the highway \\nprogram. As always, a long-term, bipartisan solution to this dilemma \\nwill be difficult to achieve and, some days, it almost seems out of \\nreach.\\n\\n    However, in the past, this committee has consistently stepped up to \\nthe plate to find ways to keep the Highway Trust Fund solvent. I am \\nconfident that we can do so again.\\n\\n    I want to make it clear at the outset that my goal as chairman of \\nthis committee to find a way to fund a long-term infrastructure bill. \\nChairman Ryan over in the House said much the same thing in yesterday\\'s \\nWays and Means Committee hearing.\\n\\n    While some friends on the other side of the aisle have suggested \\nthat it would be politically advantageous to force votes on a series of \\nvery short-term extensions, virtually everyone in Congress agrees that \\nwe need to get to the point where we are no longer facing a highway \\ncliff every few months.\\n\\n    We\\'ve all heard that the gold-standard for a long-term highway bill \\nis 6 years. That\\'s what everyone apparently wants to see happen. Of \\ncourse, according to CBO, a 6-year highway bill that maintains the \\ncurrent spending baseline will cost roughly $92 billion.\\n\\n    You don\\'t find that kind of money by sifting through the cushions \\nof your couch. It\\'s going to take hard work and real policy changes to \\nget us anywhere near that level of funding.\\n\\n    And, once again, that\\'s if we maintain current spending levels. I \\nknow that some of my colleagues believe we should raise the spending \\nbaseline at the same time, which would put even more pressure on \\nhighway funding and require us to find even more offsets to keep the \\ntrust fund solvent.\\n\\n    Long story short, a 6-year highway bill is a great goal. I\\'m \\ncommitted to working to get us as close to that goal as possible.\\n\\n    Earlier this week, some of the leaders in the Senate Democratic \\nCaucus sent a letter to the Senate Majority Leader spelling out a list \\nof demands for enacting a long-term surface transportation \\nreauthorization bill. The letter purported to dictate to Senate \\nRepublicans precisely when hearings should occur in the various \\ncommittees, when those committees should hold their markups, and when \\nthe final bill should come to the floor.\\n\\n    Of course, any specific proposals or ideas on how to fund a long-\\nterm highway bill were noticeably absent from the letter. Instead, we \\nwere treated to a discourse on how previous Congresses had dealt with \\nhighway funding and how the current Senate leadership is, in the eyes \\nof Senate Democrats, falling short.\\n\\n    I don\\'t want to spend too much time deconstructing this letter. \\nBut, I would like to point out a few simple facts.\\n\\n    First of all, neither party should point fingers and try to lay \\nblame when it comes to the now-common practice of passing short-term \\nhighway extensions.\\n\\n    Between the 110th and 113th Congresses, when the Democrats \\ncontrolled the Senate, we enacted 11 short-term highway extensions. \\nThat doesn\\'t include the 2012 MAP-21 legislation, which, according to \\nthe Senate Democrats\\' letter, was the paragon for how Congress should \\nconsider and pass a long-term extension of highway funding. Of course, \\nMAP-21 extended highway funding for only 2 years, far short of the \\ngoals that are being cited in Congress these days.\\n\\n    As I recall, during that same period, when Republicans were in the \\nminority, we didn\\'t turn the struggles over highway funding into a \\npolitical football. In fact, we approached these negotiations in a \\nspirit of cooperation as much as possible. We came to the table with \\nspecific and concrete proposals that included both revenue and spending \\noptions.\\n\\n    I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated December 11, 2011, from \\nFinance Committee Republicans to then-Chairman Baucus be inserted in \\nthe record. This letter didn\\'t dictate a path forward to Chairman \\nBaucus. Instead, it spelled out, in detail, policy proposals that \\nRepublicans could support to address an imminent shortfall in highway \\nfunding.\\n\\n    This was a constructive contribution to the debate over legislation \\nthat eventually became MAP-21, which was, once again, recently cited by \\nour friends on the other side. MAP-21 was the product of bipartisan \\nwork on the Finance Committee and was evenly split between taxpayer-\\nfriendly revenue raisers and spending reductions.\\n\\n    For example, it was Republicans who first advanced the idea of \\ntransferring unobligated funds from the Leaking Underground Storage \\nTank Trust to help pay for highways. Whatever one may think of this \\nparticular pay-for, it has become a go-to revenue source in recent \\nhighway bills, including the last two highway bills enacted under the \\nDemocrat-controlled Senate.\\n\\n    By contrast, one of the very few specific highway funding proposals \\nI\\'ve seen from any of the signatories of this week\\'s letter is the so-\\ncalled repatriation holiday, which, according to the Joint Committee on \\nTaxation, actually loses nearly $120 billion over 10 years. In other \\nwords, it is a not a serious proposal to pay for a long-term highway \\nbill.\\n\\n    Put simply, the rhetoric we\\'re hearing from many of my friends on \\nthe other side of the aisle--which was exemplified by the letter they \\nsent earlier this week--is not helpful.\\n\\n    It is not constructive. It is, I suspect, intended to have a \\npolitical impact, not to actually lead to good policy.\\n\\n    To this point, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \\nJune 3, 2015 edition of Politico be entered into the record. This \\narticle, titled ``Democrats Steer Towards Highway Funding Cliff,\\'\\' \\nbasically spells out the political strategy being employed here and \\neven quotes members of the Senate Democratic Leadership saying that \\nthey plan to force frequent votes on highway funding to make the \\nprocess as politically difficult as possible.\\n\\n    If we\\'re going to address these challenges, we need people to set \\naside the politics. We need people to do more than just talk about a \\nlong-term highway bill. We need people to bring actual ideas to the \\ntable and to come together to work toward a real, lasting solution.\\n\\n    I hope that\\'s what we can talk about during this hearing. I hope we \\ncan have a productive conversation about what solutions are out there, \\nwhich ones can work, and what ideas need to be put to bed.\\n\\n    Once again, my hope is that we can focus on solutions that can \\nactually work--that can actually be enacted into law to pay for \\nhighways.\\n\\n    For example, while I know the idea has some support, I don\\'t think \\na massive increase in the gas tax could be enacted into law. Of course, \\nanyone who believes otherwise is free to publicly correct me and to try \\nto make their case. That\\'s the type of discussion I want to have here \\ntoday--one that will actually lead to solutions. To facilitate this \\ndiscussion, we\\'ve assembled a distinguished panel of witnesses who I \\nthink will all bring a unique perspective to these issues. I look \\nforward to hearing from all of the witnesses on today\\'s panel.\\n\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n                          United States Senate\\n\\n                          COMMITTEE ON FINANCE\\n\\n                       Washington, DC 20510-6200\\n\\n                            December 2, 2011\\n\\nThe Honorable Max Baucus\\nChairman\\nU.S. Senate Committee on Finance\\n219 Dirksen Senate Office Building\\nWashington, DC 20515\\n\\nDear Mr. Chairman:\\n\\nOn Wednesday, November 9th, the Senate Committee on Environment and \\nPublic Works (EPW) reported the ``Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st \\nCentury Act of 2011,\\'\\' or ``MAP-21.\\'\\' According to Chairman Boxer and \\nRanking Member Inhofe, this legislation would authorize the Federal-aid \\nhighway program at the Congressional Budget Office\\'s baseline level, \\nplus inflation, through September 2013. EPW has made it known that they \\nexpect the Senate Committee on Finance to produce $12 billion in \\nrevenues above and beyond estimates of Highway Trust Fund (HTF) \\nreceipts. The Congressional Budget Offices (CBO) month-to-month \\nestimates of revenues generated from current fuel taxes have often \\nprovided projections of future revenue that exceed actual revenues, and \\noutlays from the trust fund are uneven and difficult to estimate on a \\nyear-to-year basis. Though we have serious concerns as to the accuracy \\nof current estimates of HTF revenues and outlays, we believe it is in \\nthe best interest of the nation for states to be provided the certainty \\nguaranteed by a surface transportation reauthorization bill. In \\naddition, we think it would be a mistake to raise fuel or other taxes \\ngiven the fragile economic climate the country is currently afflicted \\nwith. We suggest the following proposals as possibilities for closing \\nthe estimated $12 billion hole in the EPW bill by a more efficient \\nallocation of federal resources.\\n\\nRescission of funds provided for the Advanced Technology Vehicle \\nManufacturing Loan Program. The ``Energy Independence and Security Act \\nof 2007\\'\\' established this program to support the development of \\nadvanced technology vehicles. The FY 2009 Continuing Resolution, \\nenacted on September 30, 2008, appropriated $7.5 billion to support a \\nmaximum of $25 billion in loans. We understand that up to $3.5 billion \\ncould be rescinded for outlay savings. Given the continuing concern \\nregarding the administration of federal loan programs, we think it is \\nappropriate to consider this program for HTF funding.\\n\\nTransfer of funds from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund. \\nFunded primarily by a 0.1 cent-per-gallon tax on motor fuels, the \\nLeaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund was established in \\n1986 to support states and the Environmental Protection Agency in \\nefforts to remediate leaks from underground storage tanks. Due to the \\nfact that revenues to the LUST Fund have consistently been greater than \\noutlays, the fund has accumulated a balance of more than $3.5 billion \\nas of the end of fiscal year 2011, according to a report released by \\nthe Treasury Office of Inspector General. A Joint Committee on Taxation \\nreport titled ``Present Law and Background Information on Federal \\nExcise Taxes,\\'\\' which was released this past January, utilizes the \\nlatest CBO estimates available to show that the LUST Fund is estimated \\nto hold cash balances that increase year-by-year through 2020, and that \\nestimated revenues attributable only to tax revenue, as opposed to \\ninterest, are projected to be greater than estimated outlays every \\nyear. Given this information we encourage the Committee to consider a \\ntransfer of up to $3 billion from the LUST Fund to the HTF. This option \\nis not suggested to signal a lack of support for the purpose of the \\nLUST Fund, but rather to make the most efficient use of available \\nresources to avoid the impending insolvency of the HTF. Additionally, \\nfor the long-term the Finance Committee should consider altering the \\n0.1 cent-per-gallon tax on motor fuels so that the LUST Fund is able to \\nfulfill its intended purpose without diverting money from other \\nimportant programs, such as those funded by the HTF.\\n\\nReclamation of HTF funds transferred to the Land and Water Conservation \\nFund (LWCF) and redirection of Outer Continental Shelf receipts. \\nCreated by the ``Land and Water Conservation Fund Act\\'\\' in 1964, the \\nLWCF has received more than $573 million from the HTF since then. \\nThough the LWCF is authorized at $900 million a year, historically less \\nthan half of that has been appropriated in a given year. Given that the \\nLWCF is a federal fund, as opposed to a trust fund, a transfer should \\nbe offset. Additionally, the LWCF received most of its revenues from \\noil and gas leasing in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Given that \\nthe full $900 million annually authorized has never been appropriated, \\nand that the unappropriated receipts balance of the LWCF is greater \\nthan $17 billion, we encourage the consideration of a diversion of a \\nportion of future OCS revenues to the HTF. We think oil and gas \\nrevenues are an appropriate source of highway funding given that \\ncurrent highway funding is largely derived from excise taxes on fuels. \\nIf $250 million were to be diverted annually from the LWCF, it would be \\nunlikely to affect current appropriations from the LWCF, provided they \\nremain consistent with past history. A diversion of $250 million a year \\nfrom the LWCF to the HTF would deposit an additional $2.5 billion in \\nthe HTF over 10 years.\\n\\nExpanded oil and gas exploration in Alaska and the Outer Continental \\nShelf (OCS). Currently our nation is not fully utilizing available \\nenergy resources. Based on past Congressional Budget Office estimates, \\nan expansion of oil and gas exploration and development could result in \\nup to $5.2 billion in revenue to the federal government within a 10-\\nyear budget window. Allowing for increased oil and gas exploration \\nwould actually create new jobs, and provide additional revenues that \\nare badly needed.\\n\\nRescission of unspent federal funds. Though we recognize that this \\noption has not been popular with the current Senate majority and the \\nWhite House, we include it as an option in order to emphasize our \\nconviction that we do not, and should not, need to raise taxes to fund \\ntransportation infrastructure, but instead more efficiently utilize \\ncurrent federal resources. Informally the Congressional Budget Office \\nhas indicated that a rescission of $30 billion would be required to \\nproduce $12 billion in outlay savings over a 10-year period. Though in \\nthe past criticism of variants of this proposal have been based on the \\ndollar amount of budget authority rescinded, the actual amount of \\noutlays, or real spending impacted is much lower. Assuming the \\nadministration is less than enthusiastic about other ideas for filling \\nthe $12 billion hole in the EPW bill, this proposal would allow the \\nadministration to determine what federal spending it prioritizes as \\nless or more important than surface transportation funding. A \\nrescission of unspent federal funds was used earlier this year as an \\noffset for an amendment agreed to by unanimous consent that repealed an \\nexpansion of information reporting enacted into law as part of health \\ncare reform. Before adoption of the amendment, a vote on a motion to \\nwaive budgetary discipline with respect to the amendment passed 81 to \\n17.\\n\\nWe also want to note that there are many ways current funding for \\nhighways could be spent more efficiently. This would allow a given \\namount of money to do more. Specifically, repeal or relaxation of \\nDavis-Bacon requirements could drastically increase the efficiency of \\nhighway spending. ``The Davis-Bacon Act\\'\\' requires that all federally \\nfunded projects worth more than $2,000 must pay workers the \\n``prevailing wage,\\'\\' which, according to a study released by the \\nRepublican staff of the Joint Economic Committee, has resulted in wages \\nbeing 22 percent higher, on average, than prevailing market rates. \\nThough modifications to Davis-Bacon requirements would not produce new \\nrevenue to be spent on infrastructure projects, modifications such as \\nan increase in the project cost threshold, or a temporary suspension, \\nwould reduce the cost of individual projects while promoting job \\ncreation.\\n\\nMr. Chairman, we offer the suggestions in this letter as a commitment \\nto you of our willingness to work together to provide for the creation \\nand maintenance of transportation infrastructure that enhances our \\neconomy. However, we also note that at best, a fully funded ``MAP-21\\'\\' \\nwould only give us up to 2 more years to address the disparity between \\ncurrent transportation funding levels and revenues deposited into the \\nHTF. It is doubtful that ``MAP-21\\'\\' will even be sufficient to fund \\nsurface transportation programs through the end of fiscal year 2013, as \\nis currently promised. Our efforts now are, at best, a down payment on \\na necessary rethinking of infrastructure funding and financing that \\ncircumstances will demand, whether we are prepared for it or not. \\nFinance Committee Republicans are prepared to engage in this process, \\nand this letter represents the beginning of a long-term plan, and not \\nthe conclusion of a 2-year extension.\\n\\n            Sincerely,\\n\\nOrrin G.

Still, the strategy could \\nalso blow up in Democrats\\' faces, as the GOP is sure to paint them as \\nobstructionists, particularly if a shutdown comes to pass in July.\\n\\nThe goal, Democratic sources said, is to expose the GOP\\'s lack of \\nplanning ahead of the July deadline and pressure them to come up with \\nas much as $90 billion for a 6-year transportation bill, a near \\nimpossibility without politically painful tax increases. The most \\naggressive tactic, raised by Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin at a \\nprivate bicameral leadership meeting on Tuesday, would have Democrats \\nfilibuster any transportation funding extension lasting longer than 30 \\ndays.\\n\\nDemocratic leaders are now shopping the idea to their chairmen and the \\nrank and file to test just how far the party is willing to press \\nRepublicans on an issue that\\'s sharply divided the GOP: Finding tens of \\nbillions of dollars in spending savings or new taxes to pass a long-\\nterm highway bill.\\n\\nThe early returns inside the Democratic leadership meeting were \\npositive, sources said, suggesting Democrats will force a showdown over \\nthe looming transportation cliff.\\n\\n``They\\'re nothing but trouble,\\'\\' said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn. \\n``They\\'re just feeling a bit feisty and cantankerous.\\'\\'\\n\\n``They\\'re going to try to jam us on everything,\\'\\' added Senator John \\nThune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader.\\n\\nDemocrats have not yet settled on how much rope they are willing to \\ngive Republicans, but they believe they can score political points \\nhammering the GOP over legislation that supports thousands of American \\njobs. Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is expected to take the lead in the \\ncampaign, and he hopes to eventually enlist influential transportation \\nlobbying groups to join Democrats\\' push.\\n\\nBut it\\'s Durbin who\\'s suggesting the toughest tack: requiring \\nRepublicans to come up with either tens of billions for a long-term \\nbill or approximately $2 billion every month to avoid a construction \\nshutdown. Durbin reasons Democrats can hit Republicans for running up \\nagainst deadlines right after the Senate GOP allowed key surveillance \\nlaws to go dark for 2 days this week.\\n\\n``We\\'re serious about it,\\'\\' Durbin said. It ``really keeps reminding \\nthem you can\\'t put this off for 6 months or a year and expect us to \\njust stand by and let you get away with it.\\'\\'\\n\\nBut Republicans may have a trump card to play if they pursue a 5-month \\ntransportation extension, the most popular length among GOP leaders. \\nThey could dangle a vote to attach the Export-Import Bank to a highway \\npatch and dare Democrats to block the legislation after making such a \\nshow of support for Ex-Im in last month\\'s divisive debate over fast-\\ntrack trade bills.\\n\\nDemocratic senators acknowledged in interviews this could complicate \\ntheir plans to uniformly stand against any short-term highway bills, \\nbut attaching Ex-Im could also deplete support for a transportation \\nbill among conservative Republicans.\\n\\nKey Republicans on transportation acknowledged their party is \\nvulnerable on the issue, and they\\'re racing to come up with a counter-\\nstrategy. Senate Republican chairmen agreed on Tuesday in a private \\nmeeting to prioritize a long-term highway bill, which could cost $90 \\nbillion for a 6-year piece of legislation that only keeps current \\nproject funding levels going without making any increases that \\nDemocrats will also demand.\\n\\nBut that complicates the job of Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-\\nUT) and House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI), who have to \\nfind $11 billion in new revenue just to get to the end of the year. \\nThere\\'s a major division on Capitol Hill between Republicans who write \\ntransportation policy and those like Hatch and Ryan that actually have \\nto come up with the money, which is very unlikely to come through new \\ntax revenues.\\n\\nInstead, Republicans suggest they can cut spending across the \\ngovernment to come up with the $15 billion per year that the federal \\nhighway program would need for a meaty bill.\\n\\n``The shortfall is $15 billion,\\'\\' said Senator Ron Johnson of \\nWisconsin, a belt-tightening Republican up for reelection next year. \\n``Are you telling me you can\\'t find $15 billion of lower-priority \\nspending?\\'\\'\\n\\nJohnson may be disappointed given what lawmakers have been able to \\naccomplish. So far; it\\'s been difficult to find enough money just to \\npay for the short-term patches Congress has been using.\\n\\nDemocrats and Republicans on the two tax-writing committees appeared \\nclose to a deal on an $11 billion extension in mid-May with the GOP \\neven agreeing to some tax compliance measures they\\'d previously \\nopposed. But that fell apart after Democrats blamed Republicans for \\ntrying to force spending cuts into the deal and lawmakers punted the \\nfight until July.\\n\\nNow, with highway funding set to dry up in less than 2 months, \\nlawmakers seem no closer to a deal than they were in May. Several Ways \\nand Means Republicans said highways didn\\'t even come up during their \\nweekly Wednesday luncheon.\\n\\nLeaders of the House and Senate transportation committees have already \\nstarted laying the groundwork for a year-end extension. Hatch has a \\n``significant\\'\\' amount of money squirreled away for the path, Senators \\nsaid, but is keeping it close while some of his colleagues talk tough \\nabout no longer kicking the can.\\n\\n``There\\'s nothing that we\\'ll know at the end of the year that we don\\'t \\nknow right now. And I\\'ll be really disappointed if we go beyond the end \\nof July without a long-term highway bill,\\'\\' said Senator Roy Blunt of \\nMissouri, a GOP leader. ``My view is we should engage.\\'\\'\\n\\nHopping from extension to extension also seems to be taking its toll on \\nrank-and-file members. Representative Reid Ribble (R-WI)--one of 12 \\nHouse Republicans to vote no on the most recent patch--said he\\'s \\nlobbying his colleagues to oppose any more short-term deals that allow \\nlawmakers to avoid solving the fundamental imbalance between revenue \\nshortfalls from the gas tax and the more than $50 billion Congress \\nseeks to spend on transportation annually.\\n\\n``This is not rocket science, it\\'s mathematics,\\'\\' Ribble said.\\n\\nThose divisions and the lack of a public strategy for dealing with \\ninfrastructure have Democrats thinking they have Republicans right \\nwhere they want them.\\n\\n``They have to govern,\\'\\' Durbin said of Republicans\\' highway plans.\\n\\n``It\\'s a good issue for [Democrats],\\'\\' conceded one Republican \\nintimately involved in transportation planning.\\n\\nThe impact of Capitol Hill inaction on the highway program has already \\nstarted to ripple across the country. Seven state DOTs have canceled or \\ndelayed construction projects worth more than $1.6 billion this year \\naccording to a tally kept by the American Road and Transportation \\nBuilders Association. A further 12 states have warned they might be \\nforced to take similar action.\\n\\nWith Republicans overseeing highway funding in both chambers of \\nCongress for the first time in more than 8 years, their vows to govern \\nresponsibly are about to be tested.

Extending the life of \\nthe trust fund through the end of the year will require $11 billion, \\nand extending it for a decade will require nearly $175 billion.\\n\\nFor over 50 years, federal highway spending had been financed with \\ndedicated revenue, mainly from the gas tax. Since 2008, however, \\ndedicated revenues have fallen short of spending, and policymakers have \\ncovered the difference with about $65 billion of general revenue \\ntransfers--often without truly paying for the cost. Those transfers are \\nprojected to run out before the end of the year, disrupting \\ninfrastructure spending across the county.\\n\\nTo maintain important infrastructure investments and avoid adding an \\nadditional $175 billion to the debt, Congress must identify responsible \\nsolutions to close the shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund. \\nFortunately, Congress has many options at its disposal to do so (see \\nthe appendix).\\n\\nOne solution that has recently gained popularity would rely on revenue \\ngenerated from business tax reform to close some of the $175 billion \\ngap. While this would be a sensible solution, tax reform will not pass \\nbefore the current highway bill expires, and there is a risk it will \\nnot pass at all this year.\\n\\nCRFB\\'s plan, The Road to Sustainable Highway Spending, would encourage \\nthe passage of tax reform while also ensuring the Highway Trust Fund \\nremains adequately funded regardless of tax reform\\'s fate. The plan \\nwould:\\n\\n1. Get the Trust Fund Up to Speed ($25 billion) by paying the ``legacy \\ncosts\\'\\' of pre-2015 obligations with savings elsewhere in the budget.\\n\\n2. Bridge the Financing Gap ($150 billion) with a default policy to \\nraise the gas tax by 9 cents after a year and limit annual spending to \\nincome.\\n\\n3. Create a Fast Lane to Tax Reform to help Congress identify \\nalternative financing before the gas tax increase and spending limits \\ntake effect.\\n\\nThe Road to Sustainable Highway Spending would ensure the Highway Trust \\nFund remains solvent while giving policymakers flexibility to decide \\nthe level of highway spending and how it would be paid for. Our plan \\nrepresents just one of many possible solutions. Importantly, any \\nsolution must responsibly address the gap between spending and revenue \\nwithout resorting to gimmicks or deficit-financed transfers.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nSince 1956, most federal transportation infrastructure has been paid \\nfor out of the Highway Trust Fund.\\\\1\\\\ Transportation is financed from \\nan 18.4 cent per gallon gasoline tax, 24.4 cent diesel tax, and several \\nsmaller revenue sources. Since 2008, highway spending has continuously \\nexceeded dedicated revenue. Nominal outlays have continued to rise \\nmodestly faster than inflation, while revenue has remained largely flat \\ndue to fuel efficiency improvements and the lack of inflation \\nadjustment for the gas and diesel taxes.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ The Highway Trust Fund has two separate accounts: one for \\nhighways and one for mass transit. Technically, they have separate but \\nrelated and intertwined financing.\\n\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n\\nThis year, for example, federal highway spending will total $52 billion \\nwhile dedicated revenue will equal only $39 billion--leaving a $13 \\nbillion deficit. That annual shortfall will grow to $23 billion by \\n2025. While general revenue has helped cover this deficit since 2008, \\nthe funds from these transfers are projected to run low by this summer, \\ndisrupting reimbursements for existing projects and putting new \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nprojects on hold.\\n\\nPolicymakers must identify $11 billion to ensure adequate funding \\nthrough the end of this year and roughly $175 billion to maintain \\nhighway spending at current levels over the next decade.\\n\\nThis is the equivalent of a 14 cent gas and diesel tax increase,\\\\2\\\\ a \\n37 percent spending reduction, or a 3-year delay of new projects. Time \\nfor action is running short. We explain many of the issues surrounding \\nthe Highway Trust Fund in more detail in our 2014 report, ``Trust or \\nBust: Fixing the Highway Trust Fund.\\'\\'\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\2\\\\ This paper often describes the federal taxes on gasoline and \\ndiesel fuel together as ``the gas tax.\\'\\' It also describes the ``net \\nrevenue\\'\\' raised, subtracting potential payroll and income tax losses.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nExisting Plans to Fund Highway Spending\\n\\nFortunately, lawmakers have plenty of options to deal with the trust \\nfund shortfall. In Trust or Bust, we identified four different types of \\noptions: reductions in federal highway spending, increases in existing \\nrevenue sources, new revenue sources, and general tax increases or \\nspending cuts to offset general revenue transfers.\\n\\nSince that report, a number of policymakers and outside groups have \\nproposed to increase or index for inflation the federal gas tax. A \\nbipartisan proposal introduced in the House this April, for example, \\nwould index the gas tax to inflation and put in place automatic tax \\nincreases in 2017 and 2020 to close the shortfall if lawmakers do not \\notherwise act.\\n\\nAn alternative proposal that appears to have growing traction would use \\nrevenue from business tax reform to close some of the funding gap. Both \\nPresident Obama and former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave \\nCamp (RMI) suggested using a deemed repatriation tax to finance a \\ngeneral revenue transfer. Current House Ways and Means Committee \\nChairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin \\nHatch (R-UT) have also suggested tax reform as a vehicle for highway \\nfunding.\\n\\nWithin tax reform, there are alternatives to funding highway spending, \\nincluding ``deemed repatriation,\\'\\' the use of temporary revenues from \\nchanging cost-recovery schedules, or more permanent changes to \\ndedicated revenue sources such as the gas tax. With the right design, \\nsuch reform would allow for continued infrastructure investment while \\nalso promoting economic growth by creating a more competitive tax code.\\n\\nHowever, tax reform is not far enough along to pass in Congress before \\nthe highway bill expires at the end of May, is highly unlikely to be \\nenacted before additional highway funding needs arise this summer, and \\nmight not pass at all this year due to the political challenges \\nassociated with designing and enacting major tax reform legislation. \\nRelying solely on tax reform to fund the Highway Trust Fund could put \\nits finances at risk.\\n\\nPrinciples for Reform\\n\\nAlthough lawmakers have many options to address the Highway Trust Fund \\nshortfall, any responsible solution should abide by three principles:\\n\\n1. Act quickly to ensure adequate funding. Congress must extend the \\nhighway bill this month and provide sufficient funding to avoid \\ndisruptions this summer.\\n\\n2. Offset any general revenue transfers with real savings. While at \\nleast a short-term general revenue transfer is likely, it would be \\nirresponsible to enact a transfer without equal-sized spending cuts or \\nrevenue increases to offset the cost. Using gimmicks such as pension \\nsmoothing undermine the trust fund\\'s credibility.\\n\\n3. Close the structural imbalance. Lawmakers cannot rely on general \\nrevenue transfers in perpetuity and must ultimately bring highway \\nspending and dedicated revenue in line. Plans should close this gap, \\nand any that fail to do so should acknowledge that further action will \\nneed to be taken in the future.\\n\\nThe Road to Sustainable Highway Spending\\n\\nThe Road to Sustainable Highway Spending acknowledges interest in using \\ntax reform as a vehicle to fund the highway program, and facilitates \\nefforts to do so. But rather than relying on tax reform as the only \\nstrategy, the plan ensures the Highway Trust Fund remains permanently \\nsolvent regardless of tax reform\\'s ultimate fate. It also gives future \\nCongresses both the authority and responsibility to decide how much the \\nfederal government should spend on infrastructure and how it will pay \\nfor such costs.\\n\\nThe Road to Sustainable Highway Spending has three parts. First, it \\nwould enact a fully-offset general revenue transfer to pay off ``legacy \\ncosts\\'\\' from past obligations made in 2014 and earlier. Second, it \\nwould ensure highway spending and revenue remain in line by extending \\nthe current highway bill for 2 years, scheduling a 9-cent gas tax \\nincrease at the end of the first year, and limiting future highway \\nspending to trust fund income. Finally, the plan would create a ``fast \\nlane\\'\\' process for tax reform, allowing Congress to identify \\nalternatives or supplements to the scheduled gas tax increase before it \\ntakes effect.\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\nGet the Trust Fund Up To Speed--$25 billion\\n\\nThe Highway Trust Fund has about $25 billion of ``legacy costs\\'\\' from \\nunderfunded spending authorized prior to this year that is scheduled to \\nbe spent in future years. Under the current funding mechanism, future \\ngas taxes (and other dedicated sources) would be required not only to \\npay for recent and new infrastructure projects, but also the projects \\nestablished by prior Congresses.\\n\\nThe Road to Sustainable Highway Spending would fund legacy costs out of \\ngeneral revenue in hopefully the final transfer to the Highway \\nTrustFund. The plan would offset this transfer over 10 years with $15 \\nbillion from reducing and reforming agricultural subsidies and $10 \\nbillion from extending the mandatory sequester and mandatory \\ndesignation of aviation security fees through 2025. Other offsets could \\nalso be used.\\n\\nBridge the Financing Gap--$150 billion\\n\\nEnact a Two-Year Highway Bill at Current Levels. The current highway \\nbill expires at the end of May. The Road to Sustainable Highway \\nSpending would continue the bill for 2 additional years, keeping \\nnominal spending at that level over this time period. Alternatively, a \\n2-year highway bill could adjust spending levels in various areas, \\nkeeping top-line number the same. Savings could be achieved by \\nexpanding the use of tolls, reducing spending in lower priority areas \\nlike hiking trails, reforming contracting rules, leveraging private and \\nstate funding to reduce direct federal costs, or other changes.\\n\\nSchedule a 9-Cent Gas Tax Increase After 1 Year. Since 1993, the \\nfederal gas tax has totaled 18.4 cents per gallon (24.4 cents for \\ndiesel fuel) and has not been adjusted for inflation. Although The Road \\nto Sustainable Highway Spending would give Congress the opportunity to \\nidentify a funding source of its choice, it would schedule a 9-cent gas \\ntax increase by default--about adjusting the tax for past inflation--to \\ntake effect in June 2016. This would bring revenue up to current \\nspending and raise $100 billion through 2025.\\\\3\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ Note that this policy would generate about $100 billion over 10 \\nyears net of income and payroll tax losses. Actual revenue to the trust \\nfund would be significantly higher. This excess revenue could be used \\nto schedule ``reverse general revenue transfers\\'\\' to repay past un-\\noffset transfers from general revenue.\\n\\nLimit Future Highway Spending to Income. Although a 9-cent gas tax \\nincrease would bring revenue up to current spending, revenue would \\nstill fail to keep pace with inflation. To ensure future highway \\nspending does not grow faster than gas tax revenue, The Road to \\nSustainable Highway Spending would limit future annual spending \\nlevels--as measured by contract authority--to revenue plus interest \\ncollection in the prior year. The plan would also change the budgetary \\ntreatment of highway spending so it is accounted for entirely on the \\nmandatory side (for more details, see Box 1 of Trust or Bust). These \\ntwo changes would prevent future trust fund shortfalls by requiring \\nCongress to live within its means and would greatly reduce the \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nlikelihood of another general revenue transfer.\\n\\nTechnically, this change would hold spending to current revenue, \\nroughly approximating a spending freeze that would require policymakers \\nto either forego inflation adjustments or else cut lower priority \\nspending. As a practical matter, it would require and empower future \\nlawmakers to either increase revenue, reduce spending (relative to an \\ninflation adjustment), identify alternative sources of financing, or \\nsome combination. In concert with the 2-year freeze of highway spending \\ndescribed above, this policy would save about $50 billion over 10 \\nyears.\\n\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate a Fast Lane to Tax and Transportation Reform\\n\\nEncourage Tax Reform. Although The Road to Sustainable Highway Spending \\nwould schedule a future gas tax increase and constrain spending, it \\nwould give policymakers ample time and opportunity to identify an \\nalternative revenue source to replace some or all of the gas tax \\nincrease and/or allow for increased spending up what whatever level of \\ninfrastructure investment policymakers believe appropriate. \\nSpecifically, the plan would create a special process for the passage \\nof legislation that both reforms the tax code and provides funds for \\nthe Highway Trust Fund, so long as that plan doesn\\'t double-count the \\nhighway money and otherwise abides by statutory pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) \\nrules.\\n\\nOne option which appears to be gaining support would be to dedicate \\none-time revenue from tax reform--either from ``deemed repatriation\\'\\' \\nor the temporary transition revenue from certain accounting or cost-\\nrecovery changes--to the Highway Trust Fund. Such a transfer could \\ntemporarily reduce or replace the scheduled gas tax increase, pay for \\nincreases in infrastructure spending, or both. Importantly, though, \\nwhen the scheduled transfer ran out, the gas tax increase would go into \\neffect without further legislation.\\n\\nA better alternative would be for tax reform to permanently increase \\ndedicated revenue going toward the Highway Trust Fund--for example by \\nreforming the gas tax \\\\4\\\\ or creating a new source of revenue--in order \\nto permanently replace the scheduled 9-cent gas tax increase and/or \\nincrease spending levels. Making such changes as part of a broader tax \\nreform would make it easier for policymakers to address distributional \\nconcerns and provide transition relief if necessary.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\4\\\\ Among the options, the gas tax could be increased, indexed to \\ninflation, replaced with a percentage tax, or replaced with a variable \\ntax to add stability to the price of gasoline.\\n\\nEncourage Future Highway Bills to Make Tax and Spending Decisions \\nTogether. Currently, lawmakers determine highway funding in a \\ndisjointed and haphazard way by settling on spending levels and then \\nproviding ad hoc general revenue transfers. Instead, revenue and \\nspending decisions should be made together. New highway bills should \\neither set spending based on projected revenue levels or increase \\nrevenue levels to align with desired spending. By bringing revenue up \\nto current spending levels and then setting strict caps to limit future \\nspending to income, The Road to Sustainable Highway Spending would \\nencourage such decision making. Further changes in the legislative \\nprocess could reinforce this practice.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nA lasting solution to the Highway Trust Fund\\'s financing issue has \\nevaded lawmakers for several years now, and the series of short-term \\npatches often financed by gimmicks have not been helpful for \\ntransportation policy or the budget. However, recent developments such \\nas lower gas prices and a number of proposals involving transition \\nrevenue from tax reform suggest that a bipartisan highway solution may \\nbe possible this year.\\n\\nThe Road to Sustainable Highway Spending combines a one-time general \\nrevenue transfer, a 2-year highway bill, a future scheduled gas tax \\nincrease, and a requirement that highway spending remain at or below \\nincome in order to ensure the short- and long-term solvency of the \\nHighway Trust Fund. At the same time, it creates a ``fast lane\\'\\' to tax \\nand transportation reform to give Congress and the President the \\nauthority and responsibility to decide how highway spending will \\nultimately be paid for and at what level.\\n\\nImportantly, this plan represents one of many different possibilities, \\nas can be seen in the appendix, to solve the Highway Trust Fund\\'s \\nstructural imbalance. Regardless of how it is done, it is important for \\nlawmakers to come up with a real solution rather than continue to paper \\nover the shortfall with budget gimmicks and deficit spending. A real \\nsolution will provide much more certainty for surface transportation \\nprojects across the country and improve the budget outlook.\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\nThe policies contained in The Road to Sustainable Highway Spending are \\ncertainly not the only policies available to fund surface \\ntransportation spending. In this appendix, we provide several other \\noptions to close the Highway Trust Fund shortfall. Broadly speaking, we \\ndivide the options into four categories: reductions in federal highway \\nspending, increases in existing revenue sources, new revenue sources, \\nand general tax increases or spending cuts to offset general revenue \\ntransfers. As this appendix and the body of the report show, there is \\nno shortage of options to make the Highway Trust Fund solvent.\\n\\n\\n                           Table 1: Options to Reduce Surface

Director for \\n           Microeconomic Studies, Congressional Budget Office\\n    Chairman Hatch, Senator Wyden, and Members of the Committee, thank \\nyou for the invitation to testify about the status of the Highway Trust \\nFund and options for paying for highway improvements and construction.\\n                                summary\\n    In 2014, governments at various levels spent $165 billion to build, \\noperate, and maintain highways, and they spent $65 billion on mass \\ntransit systems. For both types of infrastructure, most of that \\nspending was by state and local governments; about one-quarter of that \\ntotal came from the federal government, mostly through the Highway \\nTrust Fund. For several decades, the trust fund\\'s balances were stable \\nor growing, but more recently, annual spending for highways and transit \\nhas exceeded the amounts credited to the trust fund from taxes \\ncollected on gasoline, diesel fuel, and other transportation-related \\nproducts and activities. Since 2008, in fact, lawmakers have \\ntransferred $65 billion from the U.S. Treasury\\'s general fund to the \\nHighway Trust Fund so that the trust fund\\'s obligations could be met in \\na timely manner.\\n\\n    Moreover, with its current revenue sources, the Highway Trust Fund \\ncannot support spending at the current rate. The Congressional Budget \\nOffice estimates that spending in fiscal year 2015 for highways and \\ntransit programs funded from the Highway Trust Fund will be $44 billion \\nand $8 billion, respectively, whereas revenues collected for those \\npurposes are projected to be $34 billion and $5 billion, respectively. \\nBy CBO\\'s estimate, at the end of fiscal year 2015, the balance in the \\ntrust fund\\'s highway account will fall to about $2 billion and the \\nbalance in its transit account will be about $1 billion.\\n\\n    The Department of Transportation (DOT) would probably need to delay \\npayments to states at some point before the end of fiscal year 2015 in \\norder to keep the fund\\'s balance above zero, as required by law. In \\nfact, because of the timing of the deposits to the trust fund, DOT has \\nstated that it would need to delay payments if cash balances fell below \\n$4 billion in the highway account or below $1 billion in the transit \\naccount. Then, if nothing changes, the trust fund\\'s balance will be \\ninsufficient to meet all of its obligations in fiscal year 2016, and \\nthe trust fund will incur steadily accumulating shortfalls in \\nsubsequent years.\\n\\n    Several options (or combinations of those options) could be pursued \\nto address projected shortfalls in the Highway Trust Fund:\\n\\n<box>  Spending on highways and transit could be reduced. If lawmakers \\n    chose to address the projected shortfalls solely by cutting \\n    spending, no new obligations from the fund\\'s highway account or its \\n    transit account could be made in fiscal year 2016; that would also \\n    be the case for the transit account in fiscal year 2017. Over the \\n    2016-2025 period, the highway account would the authority to \\n    obligate funds, and the transit account\\'s authority would decrease \\n    by about two-thirds, compared with CBO\\'s baseline projections.\\n\\n<box>  Revenues credited to the trust fund could be increased. \\n    Lawmakers could address the projected shortfalls by raising \\n    existing taxes on motor fuels or other transportation-related \\n    products and activities; by imposing new taxes on highway users, \\n    such as vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) taxes; or by imposing taxes on \\n    activities unrelated to transportation. The staff of the Joint \\n    Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that a one-cent increase in \\n    taxes on motor fuels--primarily gasoline and diesel fuel--would \\n    initially raise about $1.7 billion annually for the trust fund, \\n    declining over the next 10 years to about $1.5 billion each year. \\n    If lawmakers chose to meet obligations projected for the trust fund \\n    solely by raising revenues, they would need to increase motor fuel \\n    taxes by roughly 10 cents per gallon, starting in fiscal year 2016.\\n\\n<box>  The trust fund could continue to receive supplements from the \\n    Treasury\\'s general fund. Lawmakers could maintain funding for \\n    surface transportation programs at the average amounts provided in \\n    recent years, but to do so they would need to transfer $3 billion \\n    before the end of fiscal year 2015 and between $11 billion and $22 \\n    billion every year thereafter through 2025. Spending resulting from \\n    such general fund transfers could be paid for by reducing other \\n    spending or by increasing revenues from broad-based taxes, or such \\n    transfers could add to deficits and thus increase federal \\n    borrowing.\\n\\n    The projected shortfalls in the Highway Trust Fund have generated \\ninterest in greater use of borrowing by state and local governments to \\nfinance highway projects. In particular, state and local governments \\n(and some private entities) can use tax-preferred bonds that convey \\nsubsidies from the federal government in the form of tax exemptions, \\ncredits, or payments in lieu of credits to finance road construction. \\nSimilarly, some of those governments make use of direct loans from the \\nfederal government to finance projects.\\n\\n    Federal policies that encourage partnerships between the private \\nsector and a state or local government may facilitate the provision of \\nadditional transportation infrastructure, but a review of those \\nprojects offers little evidence that public-private partnerships \\nprovide additional resources for roads except in cases in which states \\nor localities have chosen to restrict spending through self-imposed \\nlegal constraints or budgetary limits.\\n\\n    Only a small number of highway projects in the United States have \\ninvolved public-private partnerships with private financing. Some that \\nhave been financed through tolls have failed financially because the \\nprivate-sector partners initially overestimated their revenues and as a \\nresult have been unable to fully repay their projects\\' debts. Perhaps \\nas a response, projects that are still under construction rely less on \\ntolls as a revenue source; more commonly, private partners are \\ncompensated from a state\\'s general funds, thus limiting the private \\nrisk of not being repaid and leaving the risk of lower-than-expected \\nrevenues to the public partner.\\n\\n    Regardless of its source, however, borrowing is only a mechanism \\nfor making future tax revenues or user fee revenues available to pay \\nfor projects sooner; it is not a new source of revenues. Borrowing can \\naugment the funds available for highway projects, but revenues that are \\ncommitted for repaying borrowed funds will be unavailable to pay for \\nnew transportation projects or other government spending in the future.\\n                 spending for highways and mass transit\\n    Almost all spending on highway infrastructure and transit projects \\nin the United States is funded publicly. Although the private sector \\nparticipates in building, operating, and maintaining projects, the \\nfederal government and state and local governments typically determine \\nwhich projects to undertake and how much to spend on them. Despite \\nseveral prominent examples, private spending on highway projects \\nconstitutes only a small fraction of the total.\\n\\n    Almost three-quarters of all public spending on highways is by \\nstate and local governments: In 2014, state and local governments spent \\n$118 billion, and the federal government spent $46 billion. Almost all \\nfederal highway spending is capital spending, which is used to build \\nand improve highways; by contrast, about 40 percent of the total for \\nstate and local governments is capital spending and 60 percent is for \\noperations and maintenance. Public-private partnerships that involve \\nprivate financing have accounted for less than 1 percent of all \\nspending on highways during the past 25 years.\\n\\n    Real (inflation-adjusted) total spending on highways by federal , \\nstate, and local governments increased in the 1980s and 1990s, but it \\nhas fallen off since then. Real spending on transit programs is much \\nless than for highways but has generally grown--especially spending by \\nstate and local governments--during recent decades (see Figure 1).\\\\1\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ For more information on infrastructure spending, see \\nCongressional Budget Office, Public Spending on Transportation and \\nWater Infrastructure, 1956 to 2014 (March 2015), www.cbo.gov/\\npublication/49910.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe Highway Trust Fund\\n    The federal government\\'s surface transportation programs are \\nfinanced mostly through the Highway Trust Fund, an accounting mechanism \\nin the federal budget that comprises two separate accounts, one for \\nhighways and one for mass transit. The trust fund records specific cash \\ninflows from revenues collected through excise taxes on the sale of \\nmotor fuels, trucks and trailers, and truck tires; taxes on the use of \\ncertain kinds of vehicles; and interest credited to the fund. The \\nHighway Trust Fund also records cash outflows for spending on \\ndesignated highway and mass transit programs, mostly in the form of \\ngrants to states and local governments.\\n\\n    Spending from the Highway Trust Fund is controlled by two types of \\nlegislation:\\n\\n<box>  Authorization acts that provide budget authority (which allows \\n    the government to incur financial obligations that will result in \\n    immediate or future outlays of federal funds), mostly in the form \\n    of contract authority (which permits the government to enter into \\n    contracts or to incur obligations in advance of appropriations), \\n    and\\n\\n<box>  Annual appropriation acts, which customarily set limits on the \\n    amount of contract authority that can be obligated in a given year.\\n\\n    The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (MAP-\\n21) authorized current highway and transit programs through fiscal year \\n2014. That authorization was subsequently extended. Most recently, the \\nHighway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-21) \\nauthorized those programs until July 31, 2015. The extension provided \\ncontract authority for highway and transit programs at an annualized \\nrate of $51 billion; the 2015 obligation limitations total about $50 \\nbillion.\\n\\n    Excise taxes on motor fuels account for 87 percent of the Highway \\nTrust Fund\\'s revenues, mostly from the tax of 18.4 cents per gallon on \\ngasoline and ethanol-blended fuels.\\\\2\\\\ Receipts from the gasoline tax \\nnow constitute almost two-thirds of the fund\\'s total revenues (see \\nTable 1). Under current law, all but 4.3 cents per gallon of that tax \\nis set to expire on September 30, 2016. If that occurs, the receipts \\nfrom the remaining tax will no longer be credited to the trust fund but \\ninstead will go into the Treasury\\'s general fund.

For several decades, the \\nbalances in the highway account were relatively stable or growing, but \\nsince 2001, receipts have consistently fallen below expenditures.\\\\3\\\\ \\n(The transit account was not established until 1983 and, until 2006, it \\nhad a different accounting treatment that makes historical comparisons \\ninapplicable.) During the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, \\nbalances in the highway account held steady in the vicinity of $10 \\nbillion. The most recent increase in the gasoline tax occurred in 1993, \\nand after the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 redirected 4.3 cents of that \\ntax from the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund, the unexpended \\nbalance in the highway account began to grow rapidly, reaching almost \\n$23 billion in 2000. In 1998, the Transportation Equity Act for the \\n21st Century (known as TEA-21) authorized spending that was sufficient \\nto gradually draw down those balances. As a result of that legislation \\nand the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity \\nAct: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), which was enacted in 2005, \\noutlays have generally exceeded revenues since 2001.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ In 2010, the trust fund saw a significant decrease in outlays \\nbecause states spent funds from the general fund of the Treasury that \\nwere appropriated in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \\n2009. That act did not require states to match federal funds or even to \\ncontribute funds to projects, and the same projects that were eligible \\nfor funding from the Highway Trust Fund were eligible for funding under \\nthe act.\\n\\n    Since 2006, when certain accounting changes specified in TEA-21 \\ntook effect, spending from the transit account has grown and, since \\n2008, has exceeded revenues credited to the account. TEA-21 and SAFETE-\\nLU authorized spending from the account that has exceeded revenues \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ncredited to the fund by between $3 billion and $4 billion every year.\\n\\n    Because of looming shortfalls, since 2008 lawmakers have enacted \\nlegislation to transfer a total of $65 billion to the trust fund--\\nmostly from the Treasury\\'s general fund--including $22 billion in 2014. \\nThose intragovernmental transfers have allowed the fund to maintain a \\npositive balance, but they did not change the amount of receipts \\ncollected by the government. After those transfers, at the end of \\nfiscal year 2014, the trust fund\\'s balance totaled $15 billion.\\n\\n    Projections of Outlays and Revenues in 2015. According to CBO\\'s \\nestimates, absent further legislation, the highway account will end \\nfiscal year 2015 with a balance of $2 billion--at the end of 2014, that \\nbalance was $11 billion (see Table 2). By CBO\\'s estimates, outlays from \\nthe highway account will total $44 billion in 2015, but revenues and \\ninterest earnings will amount to just $34 billion for the year. The \\nsituation is similar for the transit account, which is on track to end \\nfiscal year 2015 with a balance of about $1 billion, CBO estimates, \\ndown from $3 billion a year earlier. Revenues and interest earnings are \\nprojected to amount to $5 billion in 2015, but outlays are expected to \\ntotal more than $8 billion.\\n\\n\\n                                Table 2.

Under current law, the trust fund cannot incur negative balances, nor is it permitted to borrow to cover unmet\\n  obligations presented to the fund. Under the Deficit Control Act of 1985, however, CBO\\'s baseline for highway spending must incorporate the assumption\\n  that obligations incurred by the Highway Trust Fund will be paid in full. The cumulative shortfalls shown here thus are estimated on the basis of\\n  spending that is consistent with obligation limitations contained in CBO\\'s March 2015 baseline--adjusted for projected inflation--for highway and\\n  transit spending. To meet obligations as they come due, the Department of Transportation estimates, the highway account must maintain cash balances of\\n  at least $4 billion, and the transit account must maintain balances of at least $1 billion.\\n \\n<SUP>b</SUP> Some taxes that are credited to the Highway Trust Fund are scheduled to expire on September 30, 2016--among them the taxes on certain heavy vehicles\\n  and tires and all but 4.3 cents of the federal tax on motor fuels. Under the rules that govern CBO\\'s baseline projections, however, these estimates\\n  reflect the assumption that all of those expiring taxes would be extended.\\n \\n<SUP>c</SUP> The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act and the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 required certain intragovernmental\\n  transfers, mostly from the U.S. Treasury\\'s general fund, to the Highway Trust Fund in 2014. Those amounts totaled about $22 billion. CBO\\'s baseline\\n  reflects an assumption that no additional transfers from the general fund will occur.\\n\\n\\n    Unless additional funds are provided (either through an increase in \\nrevenues or through additional transfers from the general fund), the \\ndisparity between the receipts credited to the fund and outlays from \\nthe fund will require DOT to delay its reimbursements to states for the \\ncosts of construction. CBO estimates that such a delay would probably \\ntake effect sometime before the end of fiscal year 2015. Such a \\nslowdown in payments occurred in 2008 when DOT announced that balances \\nin the highway account had fallen below what it needed to reimburse \\nstates for the bills presented to the fund. Because deposits into the \\nfund are made only twice each month, DOT has testified that it would \\nneed to delay payments if cash balances fell below $4 billion in the \\nhighway account or below $1 billion in the transit account.\\\\4\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\4\\\\ Department of Transportation, Office of Inspector General, \\nRefinements to DOT\\'s Management of the Highway Trust Fund\\'s Solvency \\nCould Improve the Understanding and Accuracy of Shortfall Projections, \\nCR-2012-071 (March 2012), p. 22,\\n    https://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/29434.\\n\\n    Projections of Outlays and Revenues From 2016 Through 2025. CBO\\'s \\nbaseline projections reflect the assumptions that expiring excise taxes \\nwould be extended and that obligations from the trust fund would grow \\nat the rate of inflation. Under those assumptions, CBO projects, \\nshortfalls in both accounts of the trust fund would grow steadily \\nlarger over the next decade because revenues from the excise taxes are \\nexpected to grow very little, but spending would continue to rise (see \\nFigure 2).\\\\5\\\\ By 2025, the cumulative shortfalls would total about $125 \\nbillion for the highway account and about $43 billion for the transit \\naccount, CBO estimates.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\5\\\\ CBO constructs its baseline in accordance with provisions set \\nforth in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 \\nand in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.\\n\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n    Revenues generated by excise taxes and credited to the Highway \\nTrust Fund are projected to decline slightly over the coming decade \\nfrom about $40 billion in 2016 to about $39 billion in 2025, mostly \\nbecause increases in revenues from taxes on the use of diesel fuel and \\non truck sales are expected to be offset by declines in revenues from \\nthe tax on gasoline. Tax revenues from diesel fuel and truck sales are \\nprojected to increase, on average, by about 2 percent annually over the \\n2016-2025 period. In contrast, revenues from the tax on gasoline are \\nprojected to decline at an average annual rate of 2 percent over that \\nperiod, mainly because of mandated increases in corporate average fuel \\neconomy standards.\\\\6\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\6\\\\ For more information, see Congressional Budget Office, How \\nWould Proposed Fuel Economy Standards Affect the Highway Trust Fund? \\n(May 2012), www.cbo.gov/publication/43198.\\n\\n    If lawmakers do not address the projected shortfalls, all revenues \\ncredited to the Highway Trust Fund in 2016 will be used to meet \\nobligations made before that year. Most obligations involve capital \\nprojects that take years to complete--meaning that outlays for such \\nprojects are often spread across several years after funds have been \\ncommitted. (The Federal-Aid Highway program, for example, typically \\nspends about 25 percent of its budgetary resources in the year funds \\nare first made available for spending; the rest is spent over the next \\nseveral years.) Thus, in any given year, the vast majority of outlays \\nfrom the Highway Trust Fund stem from contract authority provided and \\nobligated in prior years. Because existing obligations far exceed the \\namounts in the fund at any given time, most of the trust fund\\'s current \\nobligations will be met using tax revenues that have not yet been \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ncollected.\\n\\n    As a result, the fund\\'s balances are not indicative of the amounts \\navailable to cover proposed new spending authority. A more useful \\nmeasure is the projected balances in the trust fund minus prior \\nobligations that have not yet been liquidated and that must be paid for \\nfrom future tax revenues collected under current law. At the end of \\n2014, for example, $65 billion in contract authority for highway \\nprograms had been obligated but not yet spent and another $26 billion \\nwas available to states but not yet obligated, for a total of $91 \\nbillion in contract authority. Tax receipts dedicated to the highway \\naccount are projected to be about $35 billion per year over the 2016-\\n2018 period for a total of $105 billion. Thus, under the calculation \\nsuggested above, there would be only about $16 billion ($105 billion \\nplus the $2 billion in the fund at the end of 2015 minus $91 billion) \\nin the fund over the next 3 years to cover the costs that would result \\nfrom providing new spending authority. So even if states were given no \\nfurther authority to spend, close to another 3 years\\' worth of motor \\nfuel taxes would need to be collected just to meet the highway \\naccount\\'s obligations at the end of 2014 plus any new obligations from \\ncontract authority made available before 2015. For the transit account, \\ncollections of almost 5 years\\' worth of taxes, at about $5 billion per \\nyear, would be needed to meet current obligations and any new \\nobligations from contract authority made available before 2015.\\\\7\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\7\\\\ See Office of Management and Budget, Budget of the U.S. \\nGovernment, Fiscal Year 2016: Appendix (February 2015), \\nwww.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Appendix. At the end of fiscal year 2014, \\nthe balance in the transit account was about $3 billion, but unspent \\ncontract authority for transit programs totaled $16 billion in \\nobligated balances and $8 billion in unobligated amounts.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOptions for Addressing Projected Shortfalls in the Highway Trust Fund\\n    Lawmakers have three primary options for addressing the projected \\nshortfalls in the Highway Trust Fund:\\n\\n<box> Reduce spending on highways and transit,\\n\\n<box> Increase taxes dedicated to the trust fund, or\\n\\n<box> Transfer general revenues to supplement the trust fund.\\n\\n    Of course, many combinations of such changes are possible.\\n\\n    Reduce Spending From the Trust Fund. Policymakers might want to \\naddress projected shortfalls by limiting federal spending for highways \\nand mass transit to the amount of revenues generated by users. That \\nreduction in spending would probably have significant negative \\nconsequences for the condition and performance of the nation\\'s highway \\nand mass transit infrastructure. In addition, unless some other federal \\nspending was increased or federal taxes lowered, the reduction in \\nfederal spending would slow economic growth and employment during the \\nnext few years relative to what it would otherwise be. Over the longer \\nterm, the smaller amount of infrastructure would impose a drag on \\neconomic performance, but the smaller amount of federal debt stemming \\nfrom the decrease in spending would provide an economic boost.\\n\\n    If lawmakers chose to avert projected shortfalls solely by cutting \\nspending, then the trust fund could not support any new obligations in \\n2016, probably significantly delaying investment in infrastructure and \\nhalting numerous transportation projects across the country. Neither \\nthe highway account nor the transit account would be able to support \\nnew obligations in 2016 because reimbursements to states for multiyear \\nprojects already under way would be expected to exceed the estimated \\nrevenue collections for that year. The highway account would be able to \\nsupport new obligations in 2017, but the transit account would not (see \\nFigure 3). Such sudden shifts in the amount of annual spending \\nauthority would probably make program administration and planning \\ndifficult for DOT as well as for state and local grant recipients.\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    Over the 2016-2025 period, obligational authority for the highway \\naccount would be about one-third less, and for the transit account, \\nabout two-thirds less, than the amounts projected in CBO\\'s baseline. \\nSuch a cut would reduce obligations for highway programs from current \\nprojections of about $47 billion per year, on average, to about $31 \\nbillion per year, on average, from 2016 through 2025. Similarly, such a \\ncut would reduce obligations for transit projects from current \\nprojections of about $10 billion per year, on average, to about $4 \\nbillion per year, on average, for the 2016-2025 period.\\n\\n    The consequences of such reductions in federal spending could be \\nameliorated, at least in part, if state and local governments responded \\nto the reduction in federal funds by increasing their own spending \\nthrough some combination of raising additional revenues, shifting \\nspending from other purposes, and borrowing.\\n\\n    If total funding for investment in highways and mass transit was \\nsignificantly reduced, then it would be especially important to \\nallocate the remaining funding, and to use that infrastructure, in the \\nmost effective way. Specifically, the negative consequences of a \\nsubstantial reduction in funding could be partly alleviated if the \\nremaining spending was focused on projects with especially large \\nbenefits and if people\\'s use of highways and mass transit was focused \\non the highest-value uses (for example, through taxes on vehicle-miles \\ntraveled or congestion pricing).\\\\8\\\\ In addition, the economic \\nefficiency of each dollar of funding could be improved if the federal \\ngovernment limited its support to projects (such as the Interstate \\nhighways) that offer significant benefits to more than one state, \\nleaving state and local governments to fund projects with more \\nlocalized benefits. If the people who benefit from a project bear its \\ncosts, the likelihood is diminished that too large a project (or too \\nmany projects) will be undertaken or that too many infrastructure \\nservices will be consumed relative to the resources needed to provide \\nthem.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\8\\\\ For a comprehensive discussion of the benefits and challenges \\nof congestion pricing, including options for its design and \\nimplementation for highways, see Congressional Budget Office, Using \\nPricing to Reduce Traffic Congestion (March 2009), www.cbo.gov/\\npublication/20241.\\n\\n    Increase Revenues Dedicated to the Trust Fund. Another approach to \\nbringing the trust fund\\'s finances into balance would be to increase \\nits revenues--for example, by raising the taxes on motor fuels; by \\nimposing mileage-based, or VMT, taxes; or by imposing taxes on \\nactivities that are not related to transportation.\\\\9\\\\ Increasing the \\ncharges that highway users pay also could promote more efficient use of \\nthe system. Economic efficiency is enhanced when highway users are \\ncharged according to the marginal (or incremental) costs of their use, \\nincluding the external costs that their highway use imposes on society. \\nA combination of a fuel tax and a VMT tax that accounts for the type \\nand weight of a vehicle and the location and time of its use could \\nprovide incentives for reducing driving\\'s social costs and could \\ngenerate funds for federal spending on highways.\\\\10\\\\ But generating \\nadditional funds that way would raise questions of fairness, including, \\nfor example, whether the structure of user charges would impose \\nrelatively greater burdens on low-income and rural users.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\9\\\\ See Congressional Budget Office, Alternative Approaches to \\nFunding Highways (March 2011), www.cbo.gov/publication/22059.\\n    \\\\10\\\\ For example, see David Austin, Pricing Freight Transport to \\nAccount for External Costs, Working Paper 2015-03 (Congressional Budget \\nOffice, March 2015), www.cbo.gov/\\npublication/50049.\\n\\n    Fuel Taxes. Excise taxes credited to the Highway Trust Fund come \\nprimarily from taxes on gasoline, ethanol-blended fuels, and diesel \\nfuels. Those excise taxes were last increased in 1993, and their \\npurchasing power is about 40 percent below that in 1993. If those taxes \\nhad been adjusted to keep pace with the consumer price index, for \\nexample, the tax on gasoline, which is currently 18.4 cents per gallon, \\nwould be about 30 cents per gallon, and the tax on diesel fuel, \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ncurrently 24.4 cents per gallon, would be about 40 cents per gallon.\\n\\n    According to JCT\\'s estimates, a one-cent increase in the taxes on \\nmotor fuels, effective October 1, 2015, would initially raise about \\n$1.7 billion annually for the Highway Trust Fund, declining over the \\nnext 10 years to about $1.5 billion annually.\\\\11\\\\ The decline occurs \\nmainly because, under current law, annual increases in the use of \\ndiesel fuel are expected to be more than offset by annual declines in \\ngasoline use because of mandated increases in corporate average fuel \\neconomy standards. If lawmakers chose to meet obligations projected for \\nthe trust fund solely by raising revenues, they would have to increase \\nthe taxes on motor fuels by roughly 10 cents per gallon, starting in \\nfiscal year 2016.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\11\\\\ Because excise taxes reduce the tax base of income and payroll \\ntaxes, higher excise taxes would lead to a reduction in revenues from \\nincome taxes and payroll taxes. The estimates shown here do not reflect \\nthose reductions. Those reductions would amount to about 25 percent of \\nthe estimated increase in excise tax receipts.\\n\\n    Fuel taxes offer a mix of positive and negative characteristics in \\nterms of many people\\'s conception of equity. They satisfy a ``user \\npays\\'\\' criterion--that those who receive the benefits of a good or \\nservice should pay its cost. But they also can impose a larger burden \\nrelative to income on people who live in low-income or rural households \\nbecause those people tend to spend a larger share of their income on \\ntransportation. Fuel taxes impose a burden even on households that do \\nnot own passenger vehicles by raising transportation costs, which are \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nreflected in the prices of purchased goods.\\n\\n    Fuel taxes have two desirable characteristics that are related to \\neconomic efficiency: They cost relatively little to implement (the \\ngovernment collects taxes from fuel distributors, and users pay the \\ntaxes when they purchase fuel), and they offer users some incentive to \\ncurtail fuel use, thus reducing some of the social costs of travel. \\nHowever, a fuel tax discourages some travel too much and other travel \\ntoo little, because it does not reflect the large differences in cost \\nfor use of crowded roads compared with uncrowded roads or for travel by \\ntrucks that have similar fuel efficiency but cause different amounts of \\npavement damage. Moreover, for a given tax rate on fuels, the incentive \\nto reduce mileage-related costs diminishes over time as more driving is \\ndone in vehicles that are more fuel efficient.\\n\\n    VMT Taxes. VMT taxes provide stronger incentives for efficient use \\nof highways than fuel taxes do because VMT taxes are better aligned \\nwith the costs imposed by users. Most of those costs--including \\npavement damage, congestion, accidents, and noise--are tied more \\nclosely to the number of miles vehicles travel than they are to fuel \\nconsumption.\\n\\n    For VMT taxes to significantly improve efficiency, however, they \\nwould need to vary greatly according to vehicle type, time of travel, \\nplace of travel, or some combination of such characteristics. For \\nexample, because pavement damage increases sharply with vehicle weight \\nbut decreases with the number of axles on a vehicle, the portion of VMT \\ntaxes assessed to maintain pavement could be small or nonexistent for \\npassenger vehicles but substantial for heavy-duty trucks, particularly \\nthose with high weight per axle. Similarly, VMT taxes could be higher \\nfor any travel on crowded urban roads during peak hours than for travel \\nin off-peak hours or on roads that are less congested.\\n\\n    In fact, a system of VMT taxes would not need to apply to all \\nvehicles on every road. There already exist less comprehensive systems \\nof direct charges for road use: Toll roads, lanes, and bridges are \\ncommon in the United States, and several states and foreign countries \\nplace weight-and-distance taxes on trucks. Expansion of existing \\nsystems could focus on highly congested roads or on entry points into \\ncongested areas; such targeted approaches would cost less to implement \\nif they required relatively simple equipment to be placed in vehicles. \\nAlternatively, the focus could be on specific vehicle types: Although \\ntrucks (excluding light-duty trucks), for example, constitute only 4 \\npercent of all vehicles in the United States, they account for roughly \\n25 percent of all costs that highway users impose on others, including \\nalmost all of the costs associated with pavement damage.\\n\\n    The costs of implementing VMT taxes include capital costs for \\nequipment and operating costs for metering, payment collection, and \\nenforcement. The cost to establish and operate a nationwide program of \\nVMT taxes is uncertain and difficult to estimate because projections so \\nfar are based mainly on small trials that have used a variety of \\nevolving technologies and because the cost would depend on whether VMT \\ntaxes varied by time, place, or type of vehicle. Although the costs of \\ncharging drivers are declining with improvements in technology, the \\ncosts remain higher than those for collecting revenues through the \\nmotor fuel taxes. The idea of imposing variable VMT taxes also has \\nraised concerns about privacy: The collection process could give the \\ngovernment access to specific information about when and where \\nindividual vehicles are used.\\n\\n    Impose Taxes Unrelated to Transportation. Lawmakers could also \\nimpose new taxes or increase existing ones on activities that are \\nunrelated to transportation. Such taxes could be designed in many ways \\nand might raise more or less than the projected shortfall in the \\nHighway Trust Fund. However, such taxes would not provide the same \\nincentives to use highway infrastructure efficiently as would \\nincreasing taxes on motor fuels or imposing a VMT tax.\\n\\n    Transfer Money From the General Fund. Lawmakers could choose to \\ncontinue to supplement the Highway Trust Fund with general revenues, \\nthus providing more money for highways and transit systems than is \\ncollected from excise taxes dedicated to those purposes. For 2015, to \\ncontinue funding for surface transportation programs at the amounts for \\nwhich obligation limitation was provided, lawmakers would need to \\ntransfer $3 billion to the Highway Trust Fund, CBO estimates.\\\\12\\\\ That \\ntransfer would allow the trust fund to maintain cash balances of at \\nleast $4 billion in the highway account and at least $1 billion in the \\ntransit account. Subsequently, to continue funding for surface \\ntransportation programs at the average amounts provided in recent \\nyears, adjusted for inflation, lawmakers would need to transfer $11 \\nbillion in 2016; such transfers would need to increase gradually to $22 \\nbillion by 2025 to maintain current spending, adjusted for inflation. \\nAt that pace, by 2025, CBO projects, general fund transfers would \\naccount for about one-third of the receipts credited to the Highway \\nTrust Fund.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\12\\\\ For more information, see Congressional Budget Office, letter \\nto Hon. Sander M. Levin regarding the estimated revenue shortfall if \\nspending authority for the Highway Trust Fund were extended beyond May \\n31, 2015 (May 2015), www.cbo.gov/publication/50234.\\n\\n    Spending that resulted from such transfers could be paid for by \\nreducing other spending or by increasing broad-based taxes, such as \\nincome taxes; or it could add to deficits and thus increase federal \\nborrowing. Reductions in other spending would mean that the benefits of \\nthe spending on transportation would be at least partially offset by a \\nreduction in whatever benefits that other spending would have provided. \\nBoosting the already-high federal debt would have long-term negative \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\neffects on the economy.\\n\\n    Increasing broad-based taxes would offer advantages and \\ndisadvantages compared with raising taxes on highway users. Two \\narguments can be made in support of using such a source of funding for \\nhighways. First, some benefits of better highway infrastructure are \\ndistributed more broadly than to just highway users. For example, \\nreducing transportation costs for suppliers and customers increases \\nefficiency by allowing businesses to specialize more in terms of the \\nproducts and services they produce and the materials they use. Second, \\nlarge amounts could be raised through small changes in tax rates. JCT \\nhas estimated that raising all tax rates on ordinary individual income \\nby 1 percentage point would yield an average of $69 billion per year \\nfrom 2015 to 2024--more than all of the current Highway Trust Fund \\ntaxes combined.\\\\13\\\\ Moreover, funding highways through broad-based \\ntaxes does not impose a larger burden relative to income on rural or \\nlow-income users (unlike some taxes on fuel use).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\13\\\\ See Congressional Budget Office, Options for Reducing the \\nDeficit: 2015 to 2024 (November 2014), p. 29, www.cbo.gov/budget-\\noptions/2014.\\n\\n    In other respects, however, the use of general revenues poses \\ndisadvantages. In particular, the approach gives users no incentive to \\ndrive less or to use less fuel, and it does not satisfy the principle \\nthat a user-pays system may be fairest and most efficient. Moreover, \\neven a small increase in existing tax rates would hamper economic \\nefficiency by discouraging work and saving and by encouraging people to \\nshift income from taxable to nontaxable forms and to shift spending \\nfrom ordinary to tax-deductible goods and services.\\n                           financing highways\\n    The projected shortfalls in the Highway Trust Fund have generated \\ninterest in increasing the amount of spending that can be sustained in \\nthe near term by encouraging state and local governments to rely more \\nheavily on debt financing. Most highway projects now are paid for with \\ncurrent state or federal revenues. Apart from increasing their own \\ntaxes or cutting other spending, state and local governments or other \\npublic entities could finance additional spending on highways in a \\nnumber of ways, including one or more of the following:\\n\\n<box> Issuing tax-preferred government bonds,\\n\\n<box> Obtaining federal loans or loan guarantees, or\\n\\n<box> Joining with a private partner to obtain private financing.\\n\\n    Tax-preferred government bonds include tax-exempt bonds (among them \\nqualified private activity bonds, or QPABs) and tax credit bonds, both \\nof which transfer some of the cost of borrowing from state and local \\ngovernments and the private sector to the federal government in the \\nform of forgone federal tax revenues. Investors are generally willing \\nto accept a relatively low rate of return on tax-preferred bonds \\nbecause interest income is exempt from federal (and many state) taxes \\nand because those bonds are backed by the taxing authority of the \\npublic entity.\\n\\n    Federal loans or loan guarantees can reduce state and local \\ngovernments\\' borrowing costs, depending on the terms of the loan, in \\npart because the federal government assumes the risk that would be \\nborne by a lender and paid for by a borrower in the form of higher \\ninterest rates. A current federal loan program offers state and local \\ngovernments an opportunity to borrow money for highways and certain \\nother transportation projects at interest rates that are based on the \\nlong-term Treasury rate.\\n\\n    Assessments of the experience with private financing of highways in \\nthe United States suggest that turning to a private partner does not \\ntypically yield additional financing, although doing so may speed the \\nprovision of financing and make new roads available sooner than they \\nwould have been otherwise. Private financing can provide the capital \\nnecessary to build a new road, but it comes with the expectation of \\nrepayment and a future return, the ultimate source of which is either \\ntax revenues collected by a government or fees from road users, like \\ntolls--the same sources that are available to governments. All told, \\nthe total cost of the capital for a highway project, whether that \\ncapital is obtained through a government or through a public-private \\npartnership, tends to be similar once all relevant costs are taken into \\naccount. Regardless of its source, financing is only a mechanism for \\nmaking future tax or user fee revenues available to pay for projects \\nsooner; it is not a new source of revenues.\\nTax-Preferred Bonds\\n    The federal government provides several types of tax preferences to \\nsubsidize infrastructure financing. Tax-exempt bonds use the well-\\nestablished tax preference of paying interest that is not subject to \\nfederal income tax. Such bonds can be issued to finance the functions \\nof state and local governments or, in the case of QPABs, certain types \\nof projects undertaken by the private sector. A second, more recently \\ndeveloped type of tax preference for infrastructure financing is \\nassociated with tax credit bonds. Such bonds come in two basic forms: \\nthose that provide a tax credit to the bondholder in lieu of paying \\ninterest and those that allow the bond issuer to claim a tax credit. \\n(For issuers with no tax liability, the credit in the second scenario \\ntakes the form of a payment from the Secretary of the Treasury. Such \\nbonds are known as direct-pay tax credit bonds.) Tax-exempt and tax \\ncredit bonds alike transfer some of the cost of borrowing from state \\nand local governments and the private sector to the federal government, \\neither in the form of forgone federal tax revenues or, in the case of \\ndirect-pay tax credit bonds, a federal outlay.\\n\\n    Tax preferences provide federal support for infrastructure \\nfinancing while generally allowing state and local governments to \\nexercise broad discretion over the types of projects they finance and \\nthe amount of debt they issue. However, tax preferences are not \\ngoverned by the annual appropriation process, so lawmakers exercise \\nless oversight over their continuation and use than is applied to \\nfederal grant and loan programs. Also, because forgone revenues are not \\nidentifiable in the federal budget, the use of tax preferences can mask \\nthe full scope of the government\\'s financial activities. Using some \\ntypes of tax-preferred bonds can be an inefficient way to deliver a \\nfederal financial subsidy to state and local governments. With a tax \\nexemption for interest income, for example, state and local borrowing \\ncosts (and the costs of the private entities that make use of QPABs) \\nare reduced by significantly less than the amount of forgone federal \\nrevenues; the remainder of that tax expenditure accrues to bond buyers \\nin the highest income tax brackets.\\n\\n    Subsidizing borrowing through the use of payments made directly to \\nborrowers can be more efficient--in terms of the benefits to state and \\nlocal governments per dollar of federal cost--and more conducive to \\nbudgetary review and control.\\\\14\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\14\\\\ For more information, see Congressional Budget Office and \\nJoint Committee on Taxation, Subsidizing Infrastructure Investment with \\nTax-Preferred Bonds (October 2009), www.cbo.\\ngov/publication/41359.\\n\\n    Tax-Exempt Government Bonds. Federal tax exemptions for interest \\nincome from government bonds (and QPABs) allow issuers of such debt to \\nsell bonds that pay lower rates of interest than do taxable bonds. \\nBecause purchasers of tax-exempt bonds demand a return that is at least \\nas high as the after-tax yield they could obtain from comparable \\ntaxable bonds, the amount by which the return from tax-exempt bonds is \\nlower than the yield on comparable taxable debt depends on the income \\ntax rate of the marginal (or market-clearing) buyer of tax-exempt \\nbonds. Thus, the amount of subsidy that state and local governments \\nreceive by issuing tax-exempt bonds is determined not by an explicit \\ndecision of the federal government, but indirectly by the federal tax \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ncode and the financial circumstances of potential investors.\\n\\n    JCT estimates that the tax exemption for state and local debt \\nresulted in $33 billion of forgone federal revenues in 2014; for the \\nsubsequent 4 years, it estimates that tax-exempt debt will reduce \\nrevenues by an additional $147 billion. According to data from the \\nInternal Revenue Service, tax-exempt bonds issued between 1991 and 2012 \\nto finance highway and other transportation projects (both for new \\nconstruction and to refund existing transportation debt) accounted for \\nbetween about one-eighth and one-fifth of the total value of tax-exempt \\nbonds issued that can be classified by the type of project financed. \\nThus, a rough estimate of the tax expenditure for transportation bonds \\nin 2014 would be between $4 billion and $7 billion. Data from \\nproprietary sources suggest that highway bonds may account for as much \\nas one-half of all tax-exempt debt issued to finance transportation \\nprojects.\\\\15\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\15\\\\ See Joint Committee on Taxation, Estimates of Federal Tax \\nExpenditures for Fiscal Years 2014-2018, JCX-97-14 (August 2014), p. \\n33, https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=\\nstartdown&id=4663; Internal Revenue Service, Statistics of Income, \\n``Table 2.

Qualified private activity bonds \\nare tax-exempt bonds that finance large infrastructure and other \\nprojects that are primarily undertaken by a private entity. Thus, QPABs \\nessentially provide publicly-supported financing to private businesses \\nor individuals; a qualified governmental unit serves as a conduit \\nbetween those entities and the purchaser of the bond. QPABs may be \\nissued to finance a wide range of infrastructure (and other) projects, \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nincluding those for transportation.\\n\\n    SAFETEA-LU allowed QPABs to be issued for certain surface \\ntransportation projects, but the law placed a cap of $15 billion on the \\nissuance of such bonds. According to DOT (as of May 12, 2015), bonds \\nwith a value of $5.8 billion have been issued for 14 projects in all \\nsince 2005. DOT has allocated another $5.3 billion of that $15 billion \\nto projects that, although approved, have not started and could use \\nQPABs in the future; about 60 percent of that amount has been allocated \\nduring the past year or so. That leaves roughly $4 billion available \\nfor future applicants. However, the $11 billion in bonds currently \\nissued or allocated under the $15 billion cap may overstate the amount \\nof QPABs that those projects will use eventually, because some projects \\nthat receiveda QPAB allocation have switched to other forms of \\nfinancing. For example, in April 2014, DOT allocated about $5.3 billion \\nfrom QPABs to seven projects that had not yet issued bonds. By May \\n2015, however, only three of them had issued QPABs, all for amounts \\nthat were significantly less than originally allocated.\\n\\n    Giving private entities access to the tax-exempt market using QPABs \\nlowers the cost of capital for those borrowers and can promote \\ninfrastructure projects when state and local governments have self-\\nimposed limits on borrowing. But, like tax-exempt government bonds, \\nQPABs result in forgone tax revenues. And, to the extent that private \\nfunding was available without QPABs, albeit at a higher cost, only \\nprojects of marginal value would be unable to receive financing without \\nthem.\\n\\n    Because of the growing number of projects seeking to use QPABs, \\nsome financial market analysts are concerned that the limit on their \\nuse will be reached soon. Development of large, complex infrastructure \\nprojects often takes years, so financial analysts are seeking certainty \\nthat QPABs will be available if they choose to apply for them. In his \\n2016 budget proposal, the President proposed measures to address the \\nborrowing limits. First, the President proposed raising the cap, by $4 \\nbillion, to $19 billion. According to JCT\\'s estimates, such an \\nadditional allocation would begin to be used sometime in 2017. Second, \\nthe President proposed authorizing a new type of QPAB for financing \\ninfrastructure investment that would be fully tax-exempt and that would \\nalso not be subject to any volume cap.\\n\\n    Tax Credit Bonds. Starting in the late 1990s, the Congress turned \\nto tax credit bonds as a way to finance public expenditures. In their \\nearly form, those bonds allowed their holders to receive a credit \\nagainst federal income tax liability instead of--or in addition to--the \\ncash interest typically paid on the bonds. The amount of the credit \\nequals the credit rate, which is set by the Secretary of the Treasury, \\nmultiplied by the face amount of the bond.\\n\\n    Tax credit bonds offer some advantages over other types of tax-\\npreferred bonds, such as tax-exempt bonds. Because bondholders pay \\ntaxes on the amount of credit they claim, tax credit bonds do not \\nresult in investors in high marginal tax brackets receiving a portion \\nof the forgone tax revenues. Rather, the revenues forgone by the \\nfederal government through tax credit bonds reduce state and local \\nborrowing costs dollar for dollar, a more efficient use of federal \\nresources than that resulting from tax-exempt bonds. Tax credit bonds \\nalso allow the amount of federal subsidy to be determined explicitly, \\nrather than depending on other federal polices (such as marginal income \\ntax rates).\\n\\n    The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 authorized Build \\nAmerica Bonds, tax credit bonds that were sold only in 2009 and 2010. \\nstate and local governments issued the bonds either as traditional tax \\ncredit bonds or, if certain conditions were met, as direct-pay tax \\ncredit bonds (known as qualified Build America Bonds). In contrast to \\nearlier tax credit bonds, Build America Bonds have an interest rate (or \\ncoupon) that is set by the issuer rather than by the Secretary of the \\nTreasury. For the direct-pay bonds, the federal government provided \\npayments directly to issuing state and local governments equal to 35 \\npercent of the interest, in lieu of a tax credit going to the \\nbondholder. The amount of that financing subsidy is greater than the \\nreduction in the interest costs that those state and local governments \\nwould have realized if they had issued traditional tax-credit bonds \\nbecause, in the latter case, the bond buyer claimingthe tax credit \\nwould have had to be compensated with additional interest income for \\nthe resulting tax liability.\\n\\n    The interest subsidies provided by direct-pay tax credit bonds \\nappear as outlays in the federal budget, making the cost more \\ntransparent and, in principle, enabling comparison with other federal \\noutlays for the same purposes. Also, because the yields provided to \\nholders of direct-pay tax credit bonds are similar to the yields of \\nother taxable securities, direct-pay tax credit bonds are more \\nattractive to tax-exempt entities than other tax credit bonds are and \\nmay therefore increase the pool of funds available to state and local \\ngovernments to finance infrastructure projects and other activities.\\n\\n    The President\\'s budget proposal for 2016 includes a direct-pay tax \\ncredit bond with a credit equal to 28 percent of each interest payment. \\nBy allowing state and local governments to substitute taxable for tax-\\nexempt bonds, the proposal would increase taxable interest income, \\nboosting federal revenues by $54 billion between 2016 and 2025, \\naccording to JCT. Because the proposal also would increase subsidy \\npayments to state and local governments (which are recorded in the \\nfederal budget as outlays) by an estimated $58 billion, the net effect \\nwould be to increase the cumulative 10-year deficit by$4 billion.\\\\16\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\16\\\\ See Joint Committee on Taxation, Estimated Budget Effects of \\nthe Revenue Provisions Contained in the President\\'s Fiscal Year 2016 \\nBudget Proposal, JCX-50-15 (March 6, 2015), http://go.usa.gov/3Pu5Q.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFederal Loans and Loan Guarantees\\n    The federal government also subsidizes borrowing by state and local \\ngovernments by providing and guaranteeing loans for infrastructure. \\nSuch credit assistance can reduce state and local governments\\' costs \\nbecause it can facilitate borrowing at interest rates that are lower \\nthan otherwise might be available, and it may open additional access to \\nthe capital markets. Specifically, in providing loans and loan \\nguarantees, the federal government assumes the risk that would be borne \\nby a lender and paid for by a borrower in the form of higher interest \\nrates.\\n\\n    The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) established rules for \\ncalculating the budgetary costs of direct loans and explicit loan \\nguarantees issued by the federal government. The budgetary cost of \\nfederal credit assistance programs is recorded as the net present value \\nof the cash flows to and from the government--the loan amount and the \\nexpected repayments--when the loan is disbursed to recipients.\\\\17\\\\ That \\nsubsidy cost represents an estimate of the net cost that the government \\nbears. In contrast, the cash flows associated with that loan between \\nthe Treasury, an agency, and borrowers occur over time and are not \\nrecorded in the budget.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\17\\\\ The net present value is the single number that expresses a \\nflow of current and future income (or payments) in terms of an \\nequivalent lump sum received (or paid) today.\\n\\n    An important aspect of the budgetary treatment of federal credit \\nprograms is that agencies must receive an appropriation equal to the \\nestimated subsidy cost before they can make or guarantee a loan.\\\\18\\\\ In \\nthe case of direct loans, FCRA specifies that loan repayments are \\nunavailable for future spending; those repayments are already accounted \\nfor in the estimated net present value of the loan, so they are not \\navailable to ``revolve\\'\\' into new loans. Such a revolving fund is the \\nmodel on which many state infrastructure banks are based. However, for \\nthe federal government, those repayments represent part of the \\nfinancing for the original loans and are implicit in the subsidy \\ncalculation. Allowing loan repayments to be used for new loans--without \\nany additional appropriation to cover the subsidy costs of the new \\nloans--would raise the effective FCRA subsidy cost of the original \\nloans to 100 percent (the same as for grants).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\18\\\\ In contrast, no appropriations are necessary for the periodic \\nrevisions to subsidy estimates that agencies make to reflect actual \\nexperience with loans and guarantees. Permanent indefinite budget \\nauthority exists for those revisions, which are recorded in the budget \\nas increases or decreases in outlays.\\n\\n    FCRA accounting, however, does not provide a comprehensive measure \\nof the economic cost of credit assistance. Through its use of Treasury \\nrates for discounting, FCRA implicitly treats market risk--a type of \\nrisk that investors require compensation to bear--as having no cost to \\nthe government. Specifically, FCRA\\'s procedures incorporate the \\nexpected cost of defaults on government loans or loan guarantees but \\nnot the cost of risk associated with uncertainty about the magnitude \\nand timing of those defaults. Investors require compensation--a \\n``market risk premium\\'\\'--to bear that risk. That premium on a risky \\nloan or guarantee compensates investors for the increased likelihood of \\nsustaining a loss when the overall economy is weak and resources are \\nscarce; that likelihood is reflected in higher expected returns and \\nlower prices for assets that carry more market risk. Taxpayers bear the \\ninvestment risk for federal credit obligations. By omitting the cost of \\nmarket risk and thereby understating the economic cost of federal \\ncredit obligations, FCRA accounting may lead policymakers to favor \\ncredit assistance over other forms of aid that have a similar economic \\ncost.\\\\19\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\19\\\\ Moreover, subsidy rates computed under FCRA exclude federal \\nadministrative costs, even those that are essential for preserving the \\nvalue of the government\\'s claim to future repayments, such as loan-\\nservicing and collection costs; those costs are accounted for \\nseparately in the budget. For more information, see Congressional \\nBudget Office, Fair-Value Accounting for Federal Credit Programs (March \\n2012), www.cbo.gov/publication/43027.\\n\\n    Loans Made Under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and \\nInnovation Act. DOT administers a loan program under the Transportation \\nInfrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (TIFIA) that provides \\ncredit assistance to state and local governments to finance highway \\nprojects and other types of surface transportation infrastructure. The \\nTIFIA program offers subordinated federal loans for up to 35 years at \\ninterest rates that are based on the rate for Treasury securities of \\nsimilar maturity. (On June 1, 2015, the interest rate on the 30-year \\nTreasury bond was 2.94 percent.) TIFIA assistance may be used for up to \\n49 percent of a project\\'s cost. Combined with other federal grants and \\ncredit assistance, TIFIA loans can be part of a package of federal \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nassistance that funds up to 80 percent of the cost of a project.\\n\\n    MAP-21 made several changes to the TIFIA program, notably \\nincreasing the amount of budget authority for the subsidy cost of the \\nprogram\\'s loans from $122 million per year in the previous \\nauthorization for highway and transit programs to $750 million in 2013 \\nand $1 billion in 2014. Because contract authority is provided for only \\nabout three-fourths of 2015, TIFIA has received $750 million so far \\nthis year. If an insufficient amount of that budget authority was used, \\nprovisions of the law directed DOT to reallocate some of those funds to \\nstates for use by their formula programs. As of April 1, 2015, \\nuncommitted budget authority for TIFIA totaled $1.139 billion. As a \\nresult, on April 24, 2015, DOT reallocated about $640 million to \\nstates.\\\\20\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\20\\\\ Gregory G. Nadeau, Federal Highway Administration, Notice: \\nFiscal Year (FY) 2015 Redistribution of Transportation Infrastructure \\nFinance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) Funds and Associated Obligation \\nLimitation (April 24, 2015), http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/legsregs/\\ndirectives/notices/n4510783.cfm.\\n\\n    MAP-21 also authorized master credit agreements and created an \\nextra interest rate subsidy for projects in rural areas. Master credit \\nagreements would allow DOT to make commitments of future TIFIA loans, \\ncontingent on future authorizations, to a group of projects secured by \\na common revenue source. Under provisions of MAP-21, rural projects \\nreceive a minimum of 10 percent of the funds appropriated and are \\neligible to receive loans at half the Treasury rate. Such an interest \\nrate subsidy makes a project relatively less expensive for the sponsors \\nand relatively more expensive for the federal government. It may result \\nin federal loans for projects that would not otherwise generate enough \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nrevenues to cover the costs of financing the projects.\\n\\n    Proposals for a Federal Infrastructure Bank. In recent years, the \\nCongress has considered several proposals for establishing a federal \\nbank to fund infrastructure projects through loans and grants.\\\\21\\\\ In \\nrecent years, the President\\'s budget has included a request to create a \\nsimilar entity.\\\\22\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\21\\\\ Other government programs that provide credit assistance for \\ninfrastructure projects include the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s \\ngrants for states\\' revolving loan funds for water projects and states\\' \\ninfrastructure banks, all capitalized with federal funds and \\nadministered by states.\\n    \\\\22\\\\ Some other proposals to establish an infrastructure bank \\ninclude providing bond insurance to issuers.\\n\\n    Whether federal credit assistance is provided through an existing \\nfederal agency or a newly created special entity, however, it would \\ninvolve similar budgetary costs to the federal government. The support \\noffered for surface transportation by most proposed infrastructure \\nbanks would not differ substantially from the loans and loan guarantees \\nalready offered by DOT through its TIFIA program. Therefore, \\ndifferences between the existing TIFIA program and an infrastructure \\nbank would primarily be operational, concerning the types of \\ninfrastructure to fund, the kinds of credit assistance to provide, the \\nselection process for projects, the amount of leverage to provide for \\nfederal funds, and the amount of private-sector participation to \\nencourage or require. For example, an infrastructure bank could focus \\non financing transportation infrastructure, or it could define \\ninfrastructure more broadly to include sewers, wastewater treatment \\nfacilities, drinking water supply facilities, broadband Internet \\naccess, or even schools. In principle, an infrastructure bank could use \\nany of several methods to finance projects, including federal loans, \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nlines of credit, and guarantees for private loans.\\n\\n    CBO has previously analyzed an illustrative federal infrastructure \\nbank--one that is representative of certain recent proposals but that \\nwould focus on surface transportation programs.\\\\23\\\\ That entity, which \\nwould be federally funded and controlled, would select new, locally \\nproposed construction projects for funding on the basis of several \\ncriteria, including the projects\\' costs and benefits, and it would \\nprovide financing for the projects through loans and loan guarantees. \\nTo repay the loans, projects would have to use tolls, taxes, or other \\ndedicated revenue streams. Financial assistance could be provided to \\nany consortium of partners with an eligible project, such as a group of \\nstate and local entities or a group of nongovernmental partners. The \\nbank could provide the subsidy amounts needed to compensate private-\\nsector investors for benefits that accrue to the general public and to \\nthe economy at large.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\23\\\\ See Congressional Budget Office, Infrastructure Banks and \\nSurface Transportation (July 2012). www.cbo.gov/publication/43361.\\n\\n    Such an infrastructure bank could have a limited role in enhancing \\ninvestment in surface transportation projects by providing new federal \\nsubsidies (in the form of loans or loan guarantees) to certain large \\nprojects, potentially including multijurisdictional or multimodal \\nprojects, and by allowing the benefits of potential projects to be more \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nreadily compared in a competitive selection process.\\n\\n    A key limitation of such a bank is that many surface transportation \\nprojects would not be good candidates for its support, because most \\nprojects do not involve toll collections or other mechanisms to collect \\nfunds directly from project users or other beneficiaries.\\nPrivate Financing\\n    Only a small number of highway projects in the United States have \\ninvolved \\npublic-private partnerships with private financing.\\\\24\\\\ Assessments of \\nthose projects indicate that such partnerships may accelerate the \\navailability of financing--for example, by circumventing states\\' self-\\nimposed limits on borrowing--but they do not generally result in \\nadditional financing. Some of the projects that have been financed \\nthrough tolls have failed financially because the private-sector \\npartners initially overestimated their revenues and as a result have \\nbeen unable to fully repay their projects\\' debts. Perhaps as a \\nresponse, projects that are still under construction rely less on tolls \\nas a revenue source; more commonly, private partners are compensated \\nfrom a state\\'s general funds, thus limiting the private risk of not \\nbeing repaid and leaving the risk of lower-than-expected revenues to \\nthe public partner.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\24\\\\ For additional information on the experience with public-\\nprivate partnerships, see the testimony of Joseph Kile, Assistant \\nDirector for Microeconomic Studies, Congressional Budget Office, before \\nthe Panel on Public-Private Partnerships, House Committee on \\nTransportation and Infrastructure, Public-Private Partnerships for \\nHighway Projects (March 5, 2014), www.cbo.gov/publication/45157.\\n\\n    Increasingly, public-private partnerships also have replaced the \\nfunds obtained through private means (at market rates) with tax-exempt \\nbonds or bonds that provide a credit against taxes owed. That change \\nhas brought the projects more in line with the way states typically \\nfinance infrastructure projects, lowering the private partners\\' costs \\nat the expense of costs to federal taxpayers and increasing the amount \\nof the government\\'s implicit equity and risk. In doing so, newer \\nprojects may have diminished the incentives associated with private \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nfinancing to control costs and to be completed quickly.\\n\\n    In addition, more recent agreements have reduced private partners\\' \\ndebt-service payments--that is, interest payments on any money borrowed \\nto finance the projects--by increasing the share of financing provided \\nby the state or locality or by the federal government. Accordingly, the \\nfinancing provided by the TIFIA program or by tax-exempt private \\nactivity bonds has become increasingly prominent for highway projects \\nthat involve public and private partners.\\n\\n    The history of privately financed roads in the United States \\nencompasses 36 projects that are either under way or have been \\ncompleted during the past 25 years. The value of the contracts for \\nthose projects totals $32 billion, a little less than 1 percent of the \\napproximately $4 trillion that all levels of government spent on \\nhighways over the period. (Both of those amounts are in 2014 dollars.) \\nIn the past few years, the number of partnerships for road projects \\nwith private financing has increased; one-half of the $32 billion in \\ncontracts has been committed in the past 5 years.\\n\\n    The amount of risk transferred to private partners has varied from \\nproject to project. In some instances, the financial risk was borne \\nprimarily by taxpayers, who were responsible for repaying debt incurred \\nby the private partner. Under one program in Florida, for example, \\nprivate businesses finance each project entirely with private debt that \\nis to be repaid over a predetermined time--usually 5 years--with future \\ngrants from the federal government, state funds, and revenues from \\ntolls collected from users of the completed road. The state\\'s guarantee \\nof repayments eliminates much of the transfer of risk that takes place \\nwith other privately financed projects. Thus, the financing is \\nessentially public, and the structure of the public-private partnership \\nis similar to that of an approach without private financing. In other \\ninstances, the private partner has borne more of the risk of the \\ninvestment--specifically, some of the private partners\\' money might be \\nlost if the project did not produce revenues as expected.\\n\\n    Over the past 25 years, 14 privately financed projects--of various \\nsizes but all involving contracts of at least $50 million--have been \\ncompleted (see Table 3). A review of those projects offers little \\nevidence that public-private partnerships provide additional resources \\nfor roads except in cases in which states or localities have chosen to \\nrestrict spending through self-imposed legal constraints or budgetary \\nlimits. To varying degrees, the projects that made use of private \\nfinancing were in states in which the government could have issued \\nbonds to finance the work through traditional means. In some cases, \\nhowever, the use of a public-private partnership accelerated a \\nproject\\'s access to financing by circumventing restrictions that states \\nhave imposed on themselves and that limit their ability to issue \\nadditional debt. (Earlier financing of a road project adds value when \\nit allows the public to enjoy the benefits of the new road sooner than \\nwould otherwise be possible.)\\n\\n    Several such projects are still under construction (see Table 4). \\nNew public-private partnerships have sought to reduce their borrowing \\ncosts by relying on publicly subsidized borrowing through the TIFIA \\nprogram and through QPABs issued by local municipalities; the QPABs \\nhave tax advantages that lower the private partner\\'s debt-service \\npayments. All but two of those projects have made use of federal \\nsubsidies through the TIFIA program. That choice of financing \\nconstitutes a return to some features of the traditional approach in \\nwhich the public sector--the federal government, in particular--retains \\ngreater risks, especially the risk of default. For instance, the South \\nBay Expressway, which had received some financing from the TIFIA \\nprogram, illustrates what can happen to taxpayers as the ultimate \\nequity holders. The project filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March \\n2010, finally emerging in May 2011. The new financing and ownership \\nstructure required by the bankruptcy court imposed a loss of 42 percent \\non federal taxpayers, replacing the original TIFIA investment with a \\npackage of debt and equity worth only 58 percent of the original \\ninvestment.\\\\25\\\\ New public-private partnerships also typically secure \\nstate or local loans or grants as part of their financing. In the other \\ncases, project managers who are responsible for a project\\'s financing \\nhave had to take out bank loans. That source of private capital was \\nmore attractive during the recent economic downturn as interest rates \\nfell relative to the yields for bonds in municipal bond markets \\n(including those of QPABs). Fewer ongoing projects today are using \\nprivate debt.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\25\\\\ Randall Jensen, ``Tollway Exits Chapter 11: TIFIA Ends Up \\nTaking a Haircut,\\'\\' Bond Buyer (May 6, 2011), http://tinyurl.com/\\n3fn8nvj.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nBudgetary Principles for the Treatment of Projects With Complex \\n        Financing\\n    Under the principles that govern federal budgeting, the budgetary \\ntreatment of complex financing arrangements--those that involve an \\nintermediary other than the Treasury raising money in private capital \\nmarkets on behalf of the federal government--should depend on its \\neconomic substance: who controls the program and its budget, who \\nselects the managers, who provides the capital, and who owns the \\nresulting entity.\\\\26\\\\ Is the activity governmental (that is, initiated, \\ncontrolled, or funded largely by the government for governmental \\npurposes) or is it an initiative of the private sector (driven by \\nmarket forces independent of the government)?\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\26\\\\ See Congressional Budget Office, Third-Party Financing of \\nFederal Projects (June 2005), www.cbo.gov/publication/16554.\\n\\n    An investment that is essentially governmental should be shown in \\nthe budget whether it is financed directly by the Treasury or \\nindirectly by a third party that is borrowing on behalf of the \\ngovernment.

Orrin G. Hatch\\n    Question. Dr. Kile, as funding from the Highway Trust Fund has \\nbecome more unstable and authorizations have been for shorter periods \\nof time, there has been more interest from States, localities, and many \\nMembers of Congress in financing mechanisms. I am talking about things \\nlike tax-exempt bonds, and infrastructure banks, and other instruments \\nwhere the intention is to get private money invested in public \\ninfrastructure. Dr. Kile, to what extent, if at all, can financing \\noptions be thought of as substitutes for money from the Highway Trust \\nFund? Does relying more on financing reduce the need of the federal \\ngovernment, or any government, to come up with the money to produce \\ninfrastructure?\\n\\n    Answer. The money in the Highway Trust Fund comes from taxes on \\ngasoline, ethanol-blended fuels, and diesel fuel; other transportation-\\nrelated taxes; and a very small amount of interest that is credited to \\nthe fund. In recent years, the Highway Trust Fund has also received \\ntransfers from the general fund of the Treasury. But other sources of \\nrevenues, such as state taxes and user fees, also pay for \\ntransportation projects; and if financing options increased theextent \\nto which those revenues paid for transportation projects, those options \\ncould be considered substitutes for money from the Highway Trust Fund. \\nMany of those financing options--such as loans that are made or \\nguaranteed by the federal government and tax-preferred borrowing by \\nstate and local governments or the private sector--impose some costs on \\nthe federal government but do not necessarily draw upon the resources \\nof the Highway Trust Fund.\\n\\n    For example, tax-exempt bonds (which pay interest that is not \\nsubject to federal income tax) can be issued to finance the functions \\nof state and local governments or, in the case of qualified private \\nactivity bonds, certain types of projects undertaken by the private \\nsector. Another, more recently developed type of tax preference for \\ninfrastructure financing is associated with tax credit bonds. Most of \\nthe costs of paying off tax-exempt and tax credit bonds are borne by \\nstate and local governments or the private sector, but some of them are \\ntransferred to the federal government, in the form of either forgone \\nFederal tax revenues or, in the case of direct-pay tax credit bonds, a \\nfederal outlay. But those costs are not attributed to the Highway Trust \\nFund. The support offered for surface transportation by most proposed \\ninfrastructure banks would not differ substantially from the loans and \\nloan guarantees already offered by the Department of Transportation \\nunder the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of \\n1998. In principle, an infrastructure bank could use any of several. \\nmethods to finance projects, including federal loans, lines of credit, \\nand guarantees for private loans. Depending on how the program was \\nstructured, the resulting costs might not be attributable to the \\nHighway Trust Fund.\\n\\n    Financing is a mechanism for making future tax or user fee revenues \\navailable to pay for projects sooner; it is not a new source of \\nrevenues. Ultimately, money that is borrowed has to be repaid with some \\nfuture source of revenues. So borrowing to finance highway projects can \\naugment the funds available for such projects in the short term, but \\nrevenues that are committed for repaying borrowed funds will be \\nunavailable to pay for new transportation projects or other government \\nspending in the future.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n                Prepared Statement of Hon.

Building America\\'s Future represents a diverse \\nand bipartisan coalition of state and local elected officials working \\nto advance infrastructure investment to promote economic growth, global \\ncompetitiveness and better quality of life for all Americans.\\n\\n    Whether it\\'s on our roads, in the air, in our ports or on our \\nrails--our nation\\'s infrastructure is falling apart. That is causing us \\nto lose our economic competitiveness and to negatively impact our \\nquality of life.\\n\\n    The nation\\'s roads are essentially one big pothole, and the tens of \\nthousands of bridges that millions of Americans drive across every day \\nare in dire need of repair.\\n\\n    Forty-two percent of our major roadways are congested causing \\ndelays and inefficiencies for commerce and the average driver. The \\nTexas Transportation Institute\\'s 2012 Urban Mobility Report states that \\ntraffic congestion had Americans wasting time and 2.9 billion gallons \\nof fuel at a cost of $121 billion--that equates to $818 per commuter. \\nAnd it\\'s no wonder. From 2000 to 2012 the nation\\'s population grew by \\n11.6 percent and the vehicle fleet increased by 10.7 percent but the \\nroad system has grown by 4 percent.\\n\\n    When it comes to air travel our skies are approaching gridlock and \\nour World War II-era air traffic control system can\\'t keep pace with \\nthe demand. According to the U.S. Travel Association, within the next \\ndecade, 25 of the nation\\'s top 30 airports will suffer the same level \\nof congestion as the day before Thanksgiving at least 2 days each week.\\n\\n    Despite a large surplus in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, the \\nbusiest U.S. harbors are under-maintained. The U.S. Army Corps of \\nEngineers estimates that full channel dimensions of the nation\\'s \\nbusiest 59 ports are available less than 35 percent of the time. And \\nonly two of our East Coast ports are deep enough to accommodate the \\npost-Panamax ships that will become the norm when the newly widened \\nPanama Canal opens.\\n\\n    Although we still don\\'t have all of the answers to the cause of the \\nhorrific derailment of the Amtrak train near Philadelphia last month, \\nit serves as a wake-up call on the critical importance of properly \\nmaintaining our infrastructure--whether it be rails, roads or bridges. \\nThe safety of all Americans depends upon it.\\n\\n    These challenges are immense but not impossible. Building America\\'s \\nFuture is calling on Congress to pass a long term and sustainable bill \\nthat does much more than provide small inflationary increases in \\nfunding. To do that it\\'s going to take all of us working together--\\nRepublicans with Democrats; the House and the Senate; and both ends of \\nPennsylvania Avenue. It\\'s also going to take vision and courage. Vision \\nto craft a long-term strategic plan that is based on measurable \\neconomic results and courage to make the tough choices to pay for it.\\n\\n    The next bill must include a growth rate more aligned to ISTEA, \\nTEA-21 and SAFETEA-LU. The growth rate in each of these bills was on \\naverage 40 percent higher than what was in MAP-21. This chart prepared \\nby the U.S. Department of Transportation clearly demonstrates the \\ngrowth rate from these reauthorizations:\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    .epsAccording to the American Society of Civil Engineers, failing \\nto provide funding levels above the baseline by 2020 would have dire \\nconsequences. The impact on a family\\'s budget would be $1,060 and \\nAmerican businesses and workers would pay a heavy price in that 877,000 \\njobs would be lost and transportation costs would increase by $430 \\nbillion.\\n\\n    It is past time for Washington to step up and produce a long term \\ntransportation plan that is robust and sustainable. To do otherwise \\nwould amount to putting a Band-Aid on a gunshot wound. America needs a \\nstrategic plan with a vision--not another short term bill that isn\\'t \\neven enough to keep filling the potholes.\\n\\n    A level-funded bill will not have what it takes to maintain and \\nmodernize our roads, bridges and transit systems. In short, we won\\'t be \\nable to build--or rebuild--to keep Americans moving safely and reliably \\naround the country.\\n\\n    For examples of what has been working I would encourage the \\ncommittee to take a look at what has been happening in the States. \\nGovernors, mayors and State legislators have been watching the gridlock \\nin Congress with growing alarm. They are concerned that the level of \\nfunding they have traditionally received from Washington has been \\nshrinking and will continue to do so without a change in vision and \\ncourage in Washington.\\n\\n    As a result, many of them have made the hard choices to propose \\nlegislation to increase the fuel tax, replace the gas tax with a sales \\ntax on fuels, or referenda allowing voters to increase local sales \\ntaxes.\\n\\n    This has been occurring in red, blue and purple states alike.\\n\\n    Over the past 3 years 14 states have successfully increased either \\ntheir fuel or sales taxes including Wyoming, Virginia, New Hampshire, \\nMaryland, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Georgia, \\nIowa, Idaho, Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah.\\n\\n    In 2013, Oregon approved legislation to undertake a pilot program \\nwith 5,000 volunteers to test the feasibility of transitioning to a \\nsystem where motorists are charged by miles driven instead of paying a \\ngas tax. This program will be getting underway next month. Other states \\nthat have adopted mileage-based user fee-related legislation include \\nCalifornia, Indiana and Washington. And states that considered such \\nlegislation this year include Arkansas, Florida and Massachusetts.\\n\\n    Governors and mayors have also used the private sector to leverage \\ntheir dollars, and as a result, more than 30 states have passed laws to \\nauthorize partnerships with the private sector.\\n\\n    The public has also endorsed many of these revenue increases by \\nconsistently approving well-constructed ballot measures to increase \\ninvestment in transportation. In last November\\'s elections, 72 percent \\nof ballot measures were approved and in 2013 the success rate was 91 \\npercent. One of the critical reasons why these measures were successful \\nis that a clear and coherent case was made about which projects would \\nbe built in exchange for approval of the revenue increase.\\n\\n    Examples of some recent success include: the approval of $250 \\nmillion in bonds to fix aging roads, bridges, sidewalks and buildings \\nin Atlanta in March of this year. In order for citizens to track the \\nprojects and their progress, the city has set up a special webpage. In \\nNovember of 2014 voters in Arlington, VA approved four bond referenda \\ntotaling more than $218 million to fund Metro and transportation as \\nwell as local parks, recreation, community infrastructure and schools. \\nAnd in 2008 voters in Los Angeles approved Measure R to hike the sales \\ntax by half a cent and generate up to $40 billion over 30 years to fund \\nvarious transit and highways projects.\\n\\n    But it is important to understand that these local and statewide \\nefforts can not replace the federal government\\'s responsibility. \\nDevolution is not the answer. The role of the federal government in \\npromoting interstate commerce is clearly stated in the Constitution.\\n\\n    Legislation such as the Transportation Empowerment Act (TEA) would \\nreduce funding for the federal-aid highway program by more than 80 \\npercent by 2019, from $45 billion to less than $8 billion. A recent \\nstudy by the Transportation Construction Coalition showed that under \\nthe TEA Act states would need to increase their gas tax by an average \\nof nearly 24 cents--just to achieve level funding. Specifically, Utah \\nwould need to raise its gas tax by 18.7 cents; Oregon by 24.1 cents; \\nIdaho by 25.5 cents; Ohio by 15.9 cents; and North Carolina by 16.4 \\ncents.\\n                            federal options\\n    The nation\\'s surface transportation program has traditionally been \\nfunded through the most pure and direct of all sources--a fee paid by \\nthe users of the system. But with better fuel economy and an increasing \\nnumber of hybrids and vehicles that use little or no gasoline at all, \\nspending from the Highway Trust Fund has outpaced revenues since 2008. \\nIn order to prevent the Highway Trust Fund from becoming insolvent, \\nCongress acted in a bipartisan fashion and transferred $8 billion from \\nthe General Fund to the Highway Trust Fund. Since 2008, approximately \\n$63 billion has been transferred to the Highway Trust Fund. But all of \\nthese transfers have done nothing to increase the amount of revenue \\nneeded to address the nation\\'s vast transportation challenges.\\n\\n    The most straightforward way to generate the needed revenue for a \\nlong term transportation bill is to increase the gas tax which has not \\nseen a raise since 1993. The cost of everything has gone up since \\n1993--except for the gas tax. In 1993 the cost of a First Class stamp \\nwas 29 cents--today it is 49 cents. A dozen eggs cost 87 cents in 1993 \\nand today the average cost is $2. The cost of the average car was \\n$12,750 in 1993 and today the average cost is $31,252.\\n\\n    Yet the gas tax has remained at 18.4 cents for 21 years. And since \\nthat time it has lost over a third of its purchasing power.\\n\\n    In order to begin generating sorely needed revenue, Building \\nAmerica\\'s Future is calling on Congress to immediately increase the \\ngasoline user fee by 10 cents and index it to inflation. According to \\nthe Congressional Budget Office, a one cent increase in the gas tax \\ngenerates $1.5 billion annually so a 10 cent increase would generate \\n$15 billion. While this would not be enough to fund a robust long term \\nbill, it would be enough to keep the Highway Trust Fund solvent while \\nCongress considers other sustainable and longer term solutions.\\n\\n    As a former elected official I fully understand the difficult \\npolitics of raising revenue. Voting to increase the gas tax is a tough \\nvote. But leadership takes vision to see the big picture and courage to \\ndo the right thing.\\n\\n    Your colleagues in the states have stepped up and their actions did \\nnot result in defeat at the ballot box. To the contrary. A political \\nanalysis by the American Road and Transportation Builders Association \\nshowed that 95 percent of all Republican state legislators who voted to \\nincrease their state gas tax in 2013 and 2014 and ran for re-election \\nin last November\\'s elections won their races. For Democrats there was \\nan 88 percent re-election rate.\\n\\n    Prior to 1993, votes to increase the gas tax in Congress were a \\nbipartisan affair. In 1982 Congress approved a four cent hike by a vote \\nof 54 to 33 in the Senate and 180 to 87 in the House. The legislation \\nwas signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. Another five cent \\nincrease was included in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990 that \\npassed the Senate 54 to 45, the House by 228 to 200 and was signed by \\nPresident George H.W. Bush.\\n\\n    It wasn\\'t until the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 when the \\npolitics of increasing gas tax revenue began to turn more partisan. The \\nfinal package contained a 4.3 cent increase that ended up being devoted \\nto deficit reduction--not the Highway Trust Fund. The package passed \\nthe House with no Republican votes and although there were a handful of \\nRepublican votes in the Senate, Vice President Gore had to cast the \\n51st vote to break the tie. President Clinton signed the package into \\nlaw.\\n\\n    The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 ultimately re-allocated the 4.3 \\ncent increase from 1993 away from deficit reduction and to the Highway \\nTrust Fund.\\n\\n    It is time to get serious and increase the gas tax. Proposals to do \\nso have been offered by Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress. In \\nparticular I want to commend Senators Corker and Murphy as well as \\nRepresentatives Blumenauer and Renacci for their vision and courage in \\noffering such proposals.\\n\\n    We must also look at a variety of other options such as \\nestablishing a National Infrastructure Bank, raising the cap on Private \\nActivity Bonds, creating a new kind of tax-exempt municipal bond called \\nQualified Public Infrastructure Bonds, consider other user based \\nfunding mechanisms such as road user charges, and lift Federal \\nrestrictions on tolling so that states may take greater advantage of \\npartnering with the private sector.\\n\\n    There has been much discussion in recent months about using \\nrepatriated funds to fund a 6 year transportation bill. While I am much \\nmore supportive of continuing the tradition of relying on a true user \\nfee to fund our transportation system, I can see the merit of tapping \\ninto repatriated funds to give Congress more time to come up with a \\nmore long term and sustainable funding source.\\n\\n    If America wants to maintain its global economic competitiveness we \\nmust reverse course. We must reject the Band-Aid and duct tape approach \\nand go big and bold.\\n\\n    This committee has an opportunity to work together to do the right \\nthing to put America back on the right path. We can no longer sit on \\nthe sidelines as our infrastructure continues to deteriorate and we as \\na nation fall behind our global economic competitors. In just 10 years \\nthe economic competitiveness of our infrastructure has gone from being \\nnumber one in the world to number 12 according to the World Economic \\nForum.\\n\\n    There is no better time to invest in our infrastructure. Interest \\nrates are at record lows and putting our friends and neighbors to work \\nrepairing and modernizing our roads and bridges is an economic plus for \\neveryone. Let\\'s get to it.\\n\\n    Thank you, Chairman Hatch. I look forward to answering the \\nCommittee\\'s questions.\\n\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n         Questions Submitted for the Record to Hon. Ray LaHood\\n               Questions Submitted by Hon. Orrin G. Hatch\\n\\n    Question. Secretary LaHood, in your testimony you discuss the \\nrecent history of the federal excise tax on gasoline, and recommend \\nincreasing it by 10 cents per gallon immediately. As an elected \\nofficial yourself, and a senior member of the Obama administration, I \\nam interested in your perspective in how the administration view the \\ngas tax as a source of revenue. The Obama administration has never \\nincluded a gas tax increase in any of their budgets, and their current \\npay-for for infrastructure is essentially international tax reform. As \\na former member of the administration, why hasn\\'t the administration \\nsought to increase the gas tax?\\n\\n    Answer. While the administration has been consistent in its \\nopposition to raising the gas tax as a way to fund transportation \\ninfrastructure, administration officials have also said that they are \\nopen to working with Congress on various options. For current insight \\ninto the administration\\'s position I would encourage you to speak \\ndirectly with Secretary Foxx.\\n\\n    Question. With the emergence of fuel efficient cars, many believe a \\nfuel per gallon tax system is steadily becoming obsolete and an \\nineffective means of collecting revenue. A different system would \\ntherefore eventually be necessary in order to ensure collection of \\nrevenue. Secretary LaHood, you cite in your testimony that in 2013, \\nOregon approved legislation to undertake a pilot program with 5,000 \\nvolunteers to test the feasibility of transitioning to a system where \\nmotorists are charged by miles driven instead of paying a gas tax. What \\ntypes of steps would be involved in adopting such a system, and what \\nwould the time frame be to transition from a fuel per gallon system to \\na different system, potentially like the system with which Oregon is \\nexperimenting?\\n\\n    Answer. I applaud the leadership that Oregon has demonstrated with \\nits latest pilot program. They clearly understand that a sustainable \\nrevenue source to fund transportation infrastructure must be \\nidentified. With regard to how a program similar to Oregon\\'s can be \\nimplemented at the federal level, I would encourage you to talk \\ndirectly with experts on road user charge programs at the Federal \\nHighway Administration or with the appropriate officials at the Oregon \\nDepartment of Transportation.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n                Questions Submitted by Hon. Dean Heller\\n                           vmt pilot program\\n    Question. Does the Department of Transportation have the capacity \\nto implement a similar volunteer pilot VMT program to replace the \\nfederal gas tax?\\n\\n    Answer. I encourage you to direct this question to the experts at \\nthe Federal Highway Administration.\\n\\n    Question. If so, how many drivers would be needed nationwide to \\ncollect enough data to adequately evaluate the benefits and concerns of \\nVMT?\\n\\n    Answer. I encourage you to direct this question to the experts at \\nthe Federal Highway Administration.\\n\\n    Question. Being a member of the Commerce Committee, I also \\nunderstand concerns about privacy in implementing such a program. What \\nsafeguards would need to be put in place so that constituents can feel \\ncomfortable with this system? Can you also speak to Oregon\\'s second \\npilot program and what safeguards to protect privacy were put into \\nplace?\\n\\n    Answer. On July 1st Oregon\\'s road user fee pilot program--OreGO--\\ngot underway. The pilot is limited to 5,000 participants who will be \\ncharged 1.5 cents per mile while driving in Oregon and receive a credit \\nfor the state gas tax they paid at the pump. According to the official \\nOreGO website, the Oregon Department of Transportation has set in place \\nstrict policies and procedures to ensure security and privacy for those \\nparticipating in the pilot program. You may review this information \\ndirectly at: http://www.myorego.org/.\\n                        vehicle registration fee\\n    Question. In addressing a solution for the Highway Trust Fund, our \\nworking group analyzed a number of options, including but not limited \\nto, a national vehicle registration fee. The Joint Committee on \\nTaxation estimated for our working group that an annual registration \\nfee of between $200-$300 would be necessary to cover Highway Trust Fund \\noutlays if all present-law Highway Trust Fund taxes were repealed and \\nreplaced with this fee.\\n\\n    What are your views on this fee?\\n\\n    Answer. I believe that all options should be on the table.\\n\\n                                  vmt\\n    Question. Secretary LaHood, you have been a vocal advocate of \\nraising the federal gas tax as a means to build a funding bridge that \\nwill carry us until a sustainable replacement is ready. I am closely \\nfollowing developments in the West whereas some states are beginning to \\npursue a fee based on charging by distance, not on a gas tax. This type \\nof ``road usage charge\\'\\' or ``mileage based user fee\\'\\' gives motorists \\na choice of what type of technology is used, and in fact even if a \\ndriver chooses a GPS option it never tracks location, only distance.\\n\\n    Could you please speak to the importance of finding a short-term \\nrevenue source to keep America competitive while simultaneously seeking \\nout and investing in user-fee based alternatives for the long-term?\\n\\n    Answer. The Highway Trust Fund will become insolvent sometime in \\nAugust and the authorization for surface transportation programs \\nexpires on July 31st. It is critical that Congress act to ensure that \\nthe Trust Fund remains solvent. The consequences of inaction would mean \\nthat thousands of projects all over America would be at risk of \\nshutting down and thousands of jobs in jeopardy as federal funding \\ndries up.\\n\\n    The easiest and most direct way to provide the needed revenue to \\nboost the Trust Fund is to raise the gas tax and index it to inflation. \\nIn theory, this can be done immediately. However, having been an \\nelected official I understand the challenging politics of raising \\nrevenue.\\n\\n    As the long term sustainability of the gas tax is an issue, it is \\nimperative that other long-term options such as a mileage based user \\nfee be further examined. As you noted, several states are exploring the \\nfeasibility of this option and the lessons learned will further inform \\npolicy makers at the federal level of the viability of implementing \\nsuch a system nationally.\\n\\n    Make no mistake, in order to remain competitive America needs a \\nlong-term infrastructure investment strategy.\\n\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n  Prepared Statement of Stephen Moore, Visiting Fellow in Economics, \\n                        The Heritage Foundation\\n    My name is Stephen Moore. I am a Visiting Fellow in Economics at \\nThe Heritage Foundation. The views I express in this testimony are my \\nown, and should not be construed as representing any official position \\nof The Heritage Foundation.\\n\\n    Mr. Chairman, with gas prices having fallen by roughly $1 a gallon \\nover the past year, many policymakers are advocating a rise in the \\nfederal gas tax. Earlier this year House minority leader Nancy Pelosi \\nargued that motorists might not even notice the hike. ``If there\\'s ever \\ngoing to be an opportunity to raise the gas tax, the time when gas \\nprices are so low--oil prices are so low--is the time to do it,\\'\\' she \\nstated.\\n\\n    This seems to be the argument that if OPEC can\\'t keep prices high, \\nthe Feds will. But there\\'s a good reason why polling stands \\noverwhelming against raising the 18.3 cents a gallon federal gas tax. \\nIt hurts the finances of the middle class. The best rule of thumb is \\nthat every penny rise in gas prices at the pump takes about $1.5 \\nbillion out of the wallets of consumers. So a 10 or 20 cent gas tax \\nwill take about $15 to $30 billion from consumers. That\\'s a massive \\nnegative stimulus to the economy at a time of stagnant wages for a \\ndecade in America.\\n\\n    By the way, the fall in the gas price increases federal revenues \\nbecause people drive more when the price is lower, and the per gallon \\nfederal gas tax collects more funds. So if anything, a fall in gas \\nprices should be coupled with a fall, not a rise in the federal gas \\ntax.\\n\\n    Proponents of higher gas taxes point to the fact that the federal \\ngas tax hasn\\'t been raised since 1993 and hasn\\'t kept pace with \\ninflation. That\\'s true, but the federal funding peaked at just about \\nthe time the 42,000 national interstate highway system was just being \\ncompleted. So the feds need less money now than 30 years ago. No one \\nargues that we should be spending today what we did in the 1960s on the \\nApollo moon landing mission.\\n\\n    Moreover, States have raised their gas taxes and funding for roads \\nin most areas is not inadequate. From 1984-2012, across the country, \\nthe pace of increase for capital expended on roads and bridges has been \\nnearly triple the inflation during this period (330 percent vs. 121 \\npercent). And this occurred during a stretch where the Nation\\'s \\npopulation grew by only one-third. The common refrain from the road \\nbuilders and civil engineers is that the infrastructure is crumbling \\nand that we need to spend hundreds of billions more. Actually, as my \\nHeritage colleagues have noted in recent reports:\\n\\n    While the common perception is that America\\'s infrastructure is \\n``crumbling\\'\\' and thus requires more federal expenditures, the reality \\nis not nearly as bleak. Some infrastructure certainly requires \\nmaintenance and updating, as congestion is a major concern in many \\nmetropolitan areas. Indeed, the federal government provides perverse \\nincentives for States to spend billions on new, unneeded projects \\ninstead of maintaining existing systems.\\n\\n    Taken as a whole, the Nation\\'s infrastructure performs well and is \\nimproving. The percentage of bridges that are structurally deficient--\\nmeaning that they require extensive maintenance, but are not \\nnecessarily unsafe--has declined from 22 percent in 1992 to 10 percent \\nin 2014. Highways and roads have also improved: The Federal Highway \\nAdministration notes that the percentage of vehicle miles traveled on \\nthe National Highway System with ``good\\'\\' ride quality rose from 48 \\npercent in 2000 to 60 percent in 2010, while the share with \\n``acceptable\\'\\' ride quality increased from 91 percent to 93 percent.\\n\\n    What is true is that America needs more roads because congestion is \\ngetting worse over time and this is a clear economic drain on the \\nUnited States. By some estimates the average American worker must work \\nthe equivalent of an extra week a year (37 hours stuck in traffic \\ncongestion) due to crowded roads and highways. But that problem can \\nalso be solved through smart tolling and other market incentives to \\nproperly price use of the infrastructure during peak commuter hours to \\nreduce overcrowding.\\n\\n    In 21st century America, tolls are the most efficient form of user \\npays and Uber-type technologies make tolling highly efficient in terms \\nof adjusting prices during peak hours to reduce congestion. By the way \\nas we move into the new era of cheap, reliable, safe, and smart Google \\nCars on the roads, time delays due to congestion will be much less of a \\nproblem in the future.\\n\\n    But the reason roads aren\\'t being built is not that the money is \\ninsufficient. It is that so little of the gas tax dollars actually go \\nto building and maintaining roads.\\n\\n    Consider the highway spending dollars for 2015. The gas tax is \\nexpected to raise roughly $39 billion in 2015. Is this enough to build \\nand repair needed federal roads? Yes, but it is not enough to fund \\ntransit projects--most of which are hugely inefficient and should never \\nbe funded with federal dollars and certainly shouldn\\'t be funded by \\nmotorists, who, by definition, don\\'t use the trains, and subways and \\nbuses.\\n\\n    Under current law, the Highway Trust Fund consistently spends more \\non road and transit projects than it receives in fuel tax revenues and \\nis expected to run a cumulative deficit of $180 billion over the next \\n10 years if current trends continue.\\n\\n    The Highway Trust Fund is divided into two accounts. The Highway \\nAccount is slated to disburse about 85 percent of combined spending on \\nroadway infrastructure and other projects in 2015. The Mass Transit \\nAccount expends about 15 percent of spending (about $8 billion a year) \\nand funds transit projects, such as rail, buses, and streetcars. This \\nis not based on fairness or good transportation policy. It is based on \\nthe political clout of urban politicians in Congress who have come up \\nwith funding formulas that benefit their districts.\\n\\n    Overall, about 25 percent of fuel tax funding is diverted to non-\\nhighway projects--including bike paths, trails, museums, and so on. \\nThese may be very worthwhile projects, but why should gas and diesel \\ntax revenues fund them?\\n\\n    Congress should begin addressing the highway funding shortage by \\ninsuring that every dollar of gas tax paid by motorists goes to \\nbuilding the roads that they make use of. That is what a ``user fee\\'\\' \\nis intended to do.\\n\\n    The argument is made by transit advocates that transit projects \\nhelp reduce congestion on roads and therefore benefit motorists. In \\nvery few cities is that the case, because outside of cities like \\nChicago, New York, Washington, DC, and San Francisco, so few Americans \\nuse mass transit. Moreover, often times building an extra lane of \\nhighway would reduce traffic congestion in rubber neck areas at one-\\ntenth the cost of massive white elephant transit projects.\\n\\n    Moreover, there is another massive inefficiency in the transit \\nprogram. States and cities are paid a much higher reimbursement rate \\nfor capital expenditures than operations. So the incentive is to build \\ngold-plated rail services with multi-billion construction costs than to \\noperate buses and other van shuttle services at a fraction of the cost. \\nThis explains why two of the greatest rail flops of all time are being \\nbuilt today: the $70 billion high speed rail project in California and \\nthe Dulles Airport ``silver line\\'\\' in Virginia that is only being \\nconstructed because the Feds are giving billions to the State of \\nVirginia. If people in the metro area had to pay for this boondoggle, \\nthey never would have allowed their tax dollars be so misallocated. By \\nthey way the project has already had four cost overruns.\\n\\n    These two examples, and multiples more, explain why transportation \\nfunding and planning needs to be turned back to the States. Again, this \\ncomports with the user pays principle of transportation which we have \\nstrayed so far from and has encouraged wasteful spending.\\n\\n    We know, by the way, that States differ dramatically in how \\nefficiently they spend on roads and highways. In my book with Arthur \\nLaffer, et al, called The Wealth of States, we document that California \\nspends about twice as much per mile of highways built than Texas (about \\n$250,000 in CA versus less than $100,000 in TX). Despite the spending \\ndiscrepancy, Texas road conditions are ranked 23rd in the Nation and \\nCalifornia\\'s are ranked dead last. What does California get for all \\nthat spending? Not much. This gap between Texas and California is due \\nto environmental and labor rules, among other things. States can get \\naway with being inefficient if they are being subsidized by the Feds. \\nThey will have to get lean and efficient if they are paying for their \\nown fiscal folly.\\n\\n    There is another way to reduce highway construction labor costs by \\nas much as 20 percent, and this is by repealing the federal Davis Bacon \\nAct, which requires effectively a union ``prevailing wage\\'\\' be paid on \\nfederal construction projects.\\n                  no to a federal infrastructure bank\\n    One idea kicking up steam is the notion of an infrastructure bank \\nto fund road, transit, green energy and other brick-and-mortar \\n``shovel-ready projects.\\'\\' The idea is that over time this could raise \\nabout $150 billion for federal infrastructure projects.\\n\\n    One typical plan, sponsored by Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, would \\ncreate an infrastructure bank funded with $50 billion, leveraged to \\nbackstop 50-year bonds that would finance billions in new \\ntransportation projects.\\n\\n    The Obama administration has a similar plan to create a bank funded \\nby $150 billion of repatriated taxes on overseas profits of U.S. \\nmultinationals. The $150 billion would collateralize tens of billions \\nof dollars of long-term loans from private investors that would fund up \\nto $100 billion of new projects each year.\\n\\n    The White House says that this plan could nearly double funding for \\nhighway and transit projects with this magical stash of funds. The \\nsupposed selling point: After the initial funding, taxpayers wouldn\\'t \\nhave to put up a dime; it would all be paid for with private dollars \\ncollected.\\n\\n    Except for the fine print. The full faith and credit of the U.S. \\nGovernment would back these loans. If the bank experiences financial \\nstress, the government would be on the hook to repay the loans. As \\nRonald Reagan would say: ``Well, there they go again.\\'\\'\\n\\n    This was exactly the financing mechanism that propped up Fannie Mae \\nwith its scam arrangement of 100 percent taxpayer guarantees on \\nsubprime mortgages. Obama\\'s budget chief once wrote that the chances of \\na Fannie Mae default were close to one in a million. It was supposed to \\nbe free money for housing--until it wasn\\'t.\\n\\n    Now, $150 billion in losses later, we know that Fannie and its \\nsister organization Freddie Mac required one of the most expensive \\ntaxpayer bailouts in American history. This is anything but a model \\nworth imitating.\\n\\n    A close inspection of many of these infrastructure bank proposals \\nindicates that rather than investments being based on sound financial \\njustifications, politics will play a major role.\\n\\n    The infrastructure bank is to take into account factors including \\nreduction in carbon emissions and income inequality, job training for \\nlow-income workers, energy efficiency, expanded renewable energy and \\nrequirements that iron, steel and other inputs be produced in the \\nUnited States.\\n\\n    The feds already provide a giant subsidy for local infrastructure \\nprojects via the tax exemption on municipal bonds. It lowers the \\ninterest rates that cities and States must pay on their infrastructure \\nbonds. Rates in the muni market have fallen sharply, from 5.41 percent \\nin 2011 to 3.6 percent last month--the lowest borrowing costs in nearly \\nhalf a century.\\n                          a better way forward\\n    Rather than raise the federal gas tax, a better policy would be to \\nphase down the federal tax and let states pay for their own road \\nprojects. The interstate highway system was completed 30 years ago and \\nthere is no more need for a national tax at 18.34 cents a gallon to \\nfund bridges and high speed rail projects to nowhere. Turning back \\ntransportation projects to the states will ensure that gas tax money is \\nused for the highest value added projects.\\n\\n    Under one current proposal, over the course of 5 years, the federal \\nfuel tax rates would decrease, from 18.3 cents per gallon to 3.7 cents \\nper gallon (gasoline) and from 24.3 cents per gallon to 5.0 cents per \\ngallon (diesel). At the same time, federal programs more appropriately \\nrun by states and cities, such as subway, bus, and bicycle programs, \\nwould end. Authority and accountability would return to states and \\nlocalities, giving them incentives to fund projects according to local \\npriorities, not those of Washington.\\n\\n    States would decide whether to increase state fuel taxes by the \\namount the federal fuel taxes decreased, such that motorists would see \\nno change at the gas pump. Or they could raise additional funds or \\npursue other revenue-generating mechanisms--user fees or taxes--to meet \\nthe level of transportation revenue they deem necessary to carry out \\ntheir priorities. In general, states should maintain the ``user pays, \\nuser benefits\\'\\' concept and should not raise unrelated taxes, such as a \\ngeneric sales tax, to fund transportation projects.\\n\\n    One last point when it comes to our ``infrastructure crisis.\\'\\' I \\ncan\\'t help noting that it is many of the same politicians, starting \\nwith President Barack Obama, who keep clamoring for more infrastructure \\nspending to create jobs and make America economically sounder, who also \\noppose the Keystone XL pipeline. This is a project that could create \\nwell more than 10,000 jobs, that would increase American energy \\nexports, and would increase U.S. National security--and would not cost \\ntaxpayers a dime--and many in Congress and in the White House oppose \\nit. We ought to do the cheap and easy infrastructure projects first.\\n\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n                 Prepared Statement of Hon. Ron Wyden, \\n                       a U.S. Senator From Oregon\\n    America\\'s transportation arteries give life to America\\'s economy. \\nNow, they need major surgery, but instead, the patient is bleeding out. \\nAnd short-term funding Band-Aids won\\'t help without a solid long-term \\nplan in place to solve the crisis.\\n\\n    My bottom line is that you can\\'t have a big-league economy with \\nlittle-league infrastructure. But the way Congress has limped from one \\nshort-term funding patch to the next more than 30 times is \\nunquestionably a little-league strategy.\\n\\n    The stop-and-go approach without a viable long-term funding source \\nlowers our sights in terms of what our transportation system can do. It \\nforces states and federal agencies into making little plans--barely \\nkeeping up with the potholes and falling far behind on new railways, \\nports, and highways.\\n\\n    Oregonians are driving across bridges that are structurally \\ndeficient or functionally obsolete. They\\'re swerving around ruts on \\nmountain passes that threaten to cause dangerous accidents. They\\'re \\nsitting in traffic jams, burning through gas and wasting time.\\n\\n    The infrastructure crisis hurts our businesses and discourages \\ninvestment in Oregon and across the land. China invests more than four \\ntimes the amount the U.S. does in infrastructure. Europe invests twice \\nas much as the U.S. The fact is, the costs associated with \\ntransportation and infrastructure are always a part of the calculus \\nwhen a company is deciding where to invest and who to hire.\\n\\n    One recent report from the American Society of Civil Engineers said \\nthat the U.S. needs to invest $3.7 trillion in infrastructure by 2020--\\nand $1.7 trillion in transportation infrastructure alone--just to reach \\n``good condition.\\'\\' Another series of short-term patches won\\'t meet \\nthat bar. And in the meantime, the same report found that Oregonians \\nspend more than $650 million a year on auto repairs and other costs \\nbecause roads and highways are crumbling.\\n\\n    It\\'s my view that funding a transportation network is right up \\nthere with maintaining a fair judicial system and a strong national \\ndefense among the most basic and necessary functions of government. \\nThere is a bipartisan understanding that our transportation system \\nneeds major investments--you hear the same messages from Democrats and \\nRepublicans on this issue.\\n\\n    So Congress and this committee have a responsibility to find a \\npathway that leads to a long-term funding source. I hope today\\'s \\nhearing reinforces the enormous need to accomplish that goal and helps \\nus move closer to a solution.\\n\\n    Next week, the committee is going to continue its consideration of \\nthis crucial topic in a hearing on how to get private dollars off the \\nsidelines and into the game on infrastructure. Several weeks ago, \\nSenator Hoeven and I introduced the Move America Act to kick-start the \\nuse of effective financing tools to help solve this crisis. I strongly \\nbelieve Move America is going to be a big part of what gets our \\ninfrastructure back up to the big-leagues, and I look forward to \\ncontinuing the discussion next week.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n                             Communications\\n\\n                              ----------                              \\n\\n\\n                        Testimony by Kurt Nagle\\n\\n                           President and CEO\\n\\n            American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA)\\n\\n                Dead End, No Turn Around, Danger Ahead:\\n\\n              Challenges to the Future of Highway Funding\\n\\n                        Senate Finance Committee\\n\\n                        Thursday, June 18, 2015\\n\\nChairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden, thank you for holding this \\nimportant hearing on the long-term financing of the highway trust fund. \\nHow we fund our infrastructure is a conversation that Congress and the \\nadministration must have and AAPA looks forward to being engaged in \\nthis conversation, especially from a freight perspective. Thank you \\nboth for your leadership on this issue.\\n\\nAAPA is the unified and collective voice of the seaport industry in the \\nAmericas. AAPA empowers port authorities, maritime industry partners \\nand service providers to serve their global customers and create \\neconomic and social value for their communities. Our activities, \\nresources and partnerships connect, inform and unify seaport leaders \\nand maritime professionals in all segments of the industry around the \\nwestern hemisphere. This testimony is on behalf of our U.S. members. \\nAAPA is also the Chair of the Freight Stakeholder Coalition, which is a \\nunique coalition of 19 national stakeholders comprised of system users, \\nplanners and builders, which has provided comments on policy and \\nfunding on the Transportation Reauthorization Bill since 1992.\\n\\nThe next surface transportation authorization is an opportunity to \\nprovide long-term, sustainable funding and to build upon MAP-21, which \\nrecognized the linkage between goods movement and economic \\ncompetitiveness. However, AAPA believes it is time to match this new \\nemphasis on freight by not only ensuring both long-term Highway Trust \\nFund solvency but also adding new and additional non-HTF funding \\ndedicated to prioritizing projects that optimize and integrate the \\nNation\\'s freight transportation system.\\n\\nThe federal government must lead long-term efforts designed to further \\nAmerica\\'s competitive advantage by advancing projects of regional and \\nnational significance as well as first and last mile projects that \\nreduce congestion, enhance goods movement, improve the environment and \\ncreate jobs. If we are committed to the modernization of our nation\\'s \\nfreight transportation system, it must accommodate projected growth in \\nmanufacturing and trade in years ahead or risk the U.S. being surpassed \\nby foreign competitors.\\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges our industry sees today--and looking \\ntoward the future--is the state of port related infrastructure, and how \\nwe as a nation make the necessary investments in that critical \\ninfrastructure. There are sizable investment needs at port facilities \\nand the connecting infrastructure on the land and waterside.\\n\\nThe Highway Trust Fund can be a vital resource for funding freight \\nprojects, such as first and last mile projects that connect the ports \\nwith the surface transportation system as well as the Congestion \\nMitigation and Air Quality Program (CMAQ), which provides funding for \\nair quality projects. Port connector projects are also eligible for the \\nSurface Transportation Program (STP) and the Projects of National and \\nRegional Significance (PNRS) program which address large choke points \\non our freight network.\\n\\nEarlier this year, AAPA asked our members to look ahead 10 years and \\nidentify the key landside infrastructure investments that need to be \\nmade. With 95% of our U.S. port members responding, The State of \\nFreight survey results identified $28.9 billion of project investments. \\nA copy of this report has been submitted for the record. Specifically, \\nAAPA members identified 34 Projects of National and Regional \\nSignificance totaling $19.5 billion.\\n\\nAdditionally, MAP-21 required the USDOT to encourage states to develop \\ncomprehensive immediate and long-term freight planning and investment \\nplans, and to collaborate with individual states, Metropolitan Planning \\nOrganizations (MPOs) and Freight Advisory Committees. In addition to \\ncomprehensive freight plans, states were also encouraged to establish \\nfreight advisory committees.\\n\\nPorts are already engaging in the planning process so there is a blue \\nprint in place on how to fund freight projects.\\n\\n  \\x01 71 percent of U.S. member ports participated in the development of \\n        its statewide freight plan.\\n\\n  \\x01 63 percent of U.S. member ports are working directly with its \\n        region\\'s MPO or Council of Governments (COG) in the development \\n        and planning of a freight project that is either underway or \\n        has recently been completed.\\n\\nHowever, fixing the highway trust fund does not fix our freight \\nnetwork. The movement of freight is intermodal, meaning that it \\npredominantly involves both rail and truck. These two modes do not \\nnecessarily exist in harmony under the current HTF structure.\\n\\nFor our country to build and sustain our infrastructure we must have an \\nintermodal program that provides direct funding for freight. Our \\nfreight infrastructure needs, demands and challenges have become much \\nmore dynamic since 1993, the last time the gasoline user fee was \\nincreased.\\n\\nThink of how much our economy, our population and how we conduct \\nbusiness has changed in the past 22 years. The growth and integration \\nof the Internet into everyday shopping has dramatically changed how we \\nmake purchases and how it is delivered through distribution type \\nbusinesses such as AMAZON and others. These new business models have \\nplaced an incredible amount of stress on our already aging \\ninfrastructure.\\n\\nFor example, our population has grown by 23 percent (or 60 million) \\nsince 1993, meaning more freight customers and more demand on our \\ninfrastructure. Additionally, in 1993, 20.4 million TEU entered the \\ncountry and moved on our rail and highways. By 2014 that number has \\nmore than doubled to 46.4 million TEUs. And the total tonnage of \\nfreight that moves through our ports and around our country has \\nincreased by 46.2 percent since 1993 to a total of 880,841 metric tons \\nin 2014. That is a lot of wear and tear on our infrastructure that is \\nalso supporting the everyday trips of commuters, shopper and tourists \\naround the country.\\n\\nThis demand on our infrastructure is only going to increase. Today, \\ninternational trade through seaports accounts for over a quarter of the \\nU.S. economy--and is projected to reach 60% by 2030. At the center of \\ntrade and transportation are America\\'s seaports, which handle \\napproximately $6 billion worth of import and export goods daily, \\ngenerate over 23 million jobs, and provide more than $320 billion in \\ntax revenues.\\n\\nTo address the immediate and long term freight infrastructure \\nchallenges, AAPA recently endorsed the concept of a 1 percent waybill \\nfee as an equitable approach to provide long-term funding for freight. \\nThis was included in legislation, H.R. 1308, Economy in Motion: The \\nNational Multimodal and Sustainable Freight Infrastructure Act, \\nintroduced by Representatives Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Dana Rohrabacher \\n(R-CA) and Mark Meadows (R-NC) and 11 other cosponsors. We urge the \\nCommittee to carefully look at this bill and how it can fund freight.\\n\\nTo help plan and make sustainable investments in a national freight \\nnetwork, AAPA has suggested several approaches:\\n\\n    (1)  Provide direct funding for freight projects,\\n\\n    (2)  Create a freight fund that provides formula funds to States as \\nwell as a discretionary grant program so that adequate funding can be \\ndistributed; and\\n\\n    (3)  Provide a sustainable funding source for the freight network. \\nAAPA recently endorsed the concept of a 1 percent waybill fee as an \\nequitable approach to provide long-term funding for freight.\\n\\nAAPA is happy to see that Congress and the administration recognize the \\nvalue of improving our freight network. Whether we will be successful \\nwill very much depend on the Senate Finance Committee finding \\nincreased, sustainable funding sources for the highway trust fund and \\nother mechanisms to fund multi modal freight improvements.\\n\\nAAPA believes a strong case is being made for direct funding toward our \\nfreight network and that freight starts and ends with our seaports. We \\nlook forward to working with the Committee as you move a sustainable \\nfunding package for the Highway Trust Fund and for our Freight Network \\nforward this summer.\\n\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n            American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA)\\n\\n                      Port Surface Transportation \\n                         Infrastructure Survey\\n\\n                          The State of Freight\\n\\n                             April 21, 2015\\n\\n                              Version 1.2\\n\\n1 in 3 u.s. ports needs at least $100 million in intermodal upgrades to \\n                 handle projected 2025 freight volumes\\n\\n                           Executive Summary\\n\\nIn Peter Zeihan\\'s acclaimed 2014 book, ``The Accidental Superpower,\\'\\' \\nhe cites the overwhelming freight transportation advantage the United \\nStates has over other trading nations in its system of ports and \\nwaterways. He argues that America has more miles of navigable waterways \\nthan any other nation, together with an enviable coastal geography of \\nnaturally deep harbors, barrier islands and indentations that are \\nunmatched for seaport development anywhere in the world.\\n\\nUnfortunately, due to insufficient investment in its freight \\ntransportation infrastructure, every day America is losing some of the \\ngoods movement advantage asserted in Mr. Zeihan\\'s book.\\n\\nSeaports are the backbone of a thriving 21st century global economy. \\nYet, a nation\\'s freight transportation system is only as good as its \\nunderlying infrastructure. In the American Association of Port \\nAuthorities\\' (AAPA) 2015 Surface Transportation Infrastructure Survey--\\nThe State of Freight, results indicate that the Nation\\'s unsurpassed \\ngoods movement network needs immediate and significant investment in \\nthe arteries that carry freight to and from its seaports. Without that \\ninvestment, the American economy, the jobs it produces and the \\ninternational competitiveness it offers will erode and suffer, creating \\npredictable and oftentimes severe hardships to the individuals who live \\nand businesses that operate within its borders.\\n\\nIn 2013 alone, some 1.3 billion metric tons of imported and exported \\ncargo, worth nearly $1.75 trillion, moved through America\\'s seaports, \\nwhile an estimated 900 million metric tons of domestic cargo with a \\nmarket value of over $400 billion was also handled through these \\ninternational gateways.\\n\\nPort-related infrastructure connects American farmers, manufacturers \\nand consumers to the world marketplace and is facilitating the increase \\nof American exports that are essential to the nation\\'s sustained \\neconomic growth. In 2007, Martin Associates, of Lancaster, PA, reported \\nthat U.S. port activity was responsible for about 13.3 million American \\njobs and $212.4 billion in federal, state and local tax revenue. Martin \\nAssociates\\' 2015 nationwide porteconomic impacts update study shows the \\nbenefits of America\\'s seaports having risen sharply over the \\nintervening years, now responsible for 23.1 million U.S. jobs and \\n$321.1 billion in Federal, State and local tax revenue. According to \\nthe study, marine cargo activity at U.S. deep-water ports also \\ngenerated $4.6 trillion in total economic activity, or roughly 26 \\npercent of the Nation\\'s economy in 2014, compared to $3.2 trillion in \\ncombined economic activity associated with U.S. deep-water ports in \\n2007, or roughly 20 percent of the Nation\\'s GDP at the time.\\n\\n        ``Enhancing connections between highway and rail systems and \\n        port infrastructure will be a key part of ensuring the first \\n        and last mile of transportation infrastructure supports growing \\n        demand.\\'\\'\\n\\n        U.S. Senator John Thune (R-SD)\\n        Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \\n        Transportation\\n\\nDespite the importance to the economy, freight investments are \\ndisadvantaged in the current transportation planning and funding \\nprocess. Freight projects face competition from non-freight projects \\nfor public funds and community support. Although passenger and freight \\nmovements must coexist on America\\'s transportation network, these are \\ntwo distinctly different stakeholder constituencies.\\n\\nBecause there\\'s no clear definition of what constitutes ``freight \\nprojects\\'\\' in the federal government lexicon, there\\'s been a lack of \\ncoordination among federal and state government entities and private \\nsector stakeholders. This has resulted in a shortage of public funds to \\nplan and invest in the nation\\'s freight network and address the key \\nfreight chokepoints that impact both passenger and freight \\nconstituencies.\\n\\nDue to their significant role in driving commerce, public seaports have \\nthe experience to help grow the economy, create jobs and promote an \\nefficient, safe and environmentally sustainable freight network. As in \\nany other successful operation, every port has a business plan for its \\nlong-term success to identify markets, leverage assets and prioritize \\nand sustain its capital investments. Similarly, if America wants its \\ntransportation system to achieve long-lasting and sustainable success, \\nit must implement a national freight plan to develop, sustain and grow \\nits advantages for moving goods.\\n\\nThe results of AAPA\\'s infrastructure survey reinforce one of the \\nindustry\\'s key messages, ``Seaports Deliver Prosperity.\\'\\' The survey \\nalso illustrates the significant steps public ports are making and have \\nmade in working with the planning community in developing and investing \\nin freight projects. This has been particularly evident since passage \\nof the 2012 Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), \\nwhich laid out a clear and aggressive vision on how America plans and \\ncoordinates a national freight plan through collaboration with the \\nindividual states.\\n\\nAdditionally, this survey helps define the role ports are continuing to \\nplay in developing innovative Public Private Partnerships (P3s) with \\nthe nation\\'s business sector, and facilitating additional resources \\ninto the process.\\n\\nThis survey focuses on seaports--critical gateways in the U.S. freight \\nnetwork through which more than 99 percent of America\\'s overseas trade \\nmust pass. While there are other components of the freight network that \\nmust be addressed, the impact of vital seaport ``first and last mile\\'\\' \\nconnectors on the country\\'sregional and national transportation \\ninfrastructure cannot be overstated. Ports are national models of \\neffective intermodalism and are the very definition of critical \\ninfrastructure.\\n\\n        From 2007-2014 the annual impact of America\\'s seaports \\n        increased:\\n        43 percent to $4.6 trillion \\n        in total U.S. economic \\n        value                         74 percent to 23.1 million U.S. \\n                                      jobs\\n        51 percent to $321.1 \\n        billion in Federal, State \\n        and local tax revenue         100 percent to $1.5 billion in \\n                                      personal wages and salaries\\n\\n                    Survey Purpose and Participation\\n\\nThe purpose of AAPA\\'s 2015 Port Surface Freight Infrastructure Survey \\nis to quantify the baseline need for investment in port infrastructure \\nconnecting the United States\\' deep-draft seaports to the rest of the \\nnation\\'s freight transportation system. The survey results reflect \\nresponses to questions asked of AAPA\\'s 83 U.S. member public ports in \\nthe 6 months leading up to the publication of this report. With a 95 \\npercent response rate, the survey represents nearly all of the top U.S. \\nseaports on the Atlantic, Pacific and gulf coasts, and along the Great \\nLakes.\\n\\nThe survey seeks to illustrate the critical nature of connection points \\nbetween seaports and the national surface transportation system, \\nincluding highway connectors and on-dock rail. It\\'s at these critical \\nconnection and transfer points that the efficiency of moving freight \\nthrough seaports and to and from the interior of the country can be \\nmaximized. These connection and transfer points for goods are the \\nfoundation of America\\'s freight network.\\n\\nThe freight network is vast and evolving. It\\'s a living grid that \\ninfuses an economic lifeline throughout the country; from small towns \\nto major metropolitan regions, and farming districts to technology \\ncenters like Silicon Valley. At its heart are America\\'s seaports, which \\nhandle an overwhelming majority of the nearly $6 billion worth of \\nproducts that move to and from overseas markets every day. For the \\nnetwork to work properly, it must seamlessly connect to commerce \\ncenters in every community, state and territory, as well as to an ever-\\ngrowing and vibrant inland waterway system that is unparalleled \\nworldwide.\\n\\n        ``Every type of transportation plays an important role in our \\n        national transportation network, but maritime and waterborne \\n        transportation in particular serves as our country\\'s connection \\n        to the world economy.\\'\\'\\n\\n        U.S. Representative Bill Shuster (R-PA)\\n        Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure\\n\\n        Analysis of Surface Transportation Connectors With Ports\\n\\nIt\\'s been two decades since the United States addressed its surface \\ntransportation connectors. In 1995, the National Highway System (NHS) \\nDesignation Act, directed the Secretary of the U.S. Department of \\nTransportation (USDOT) to develop a list of NHS intermodal connectors. \\nWith the input of state departments of transportation, the list was \\ncompleted in 1998. In 2000, USDOT reported to Congress on the state of \\nNHS Intermodal Freight Connectors. USDOT identified significant \\ndeficiencies in U.S. freight connectors and estimated the cost of them \\nto be $2.6 billion.\\n\\nBetween 2000 and 2013, the volume of containers shipped through U.S. \\nports grew by approximately 50 percent, from 30.4 million to 44.6 \\nmillion 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs), adding further strain to port \\nhighway and rail connectors. The population in U.S. metropolitan areas \\nalso grew by 33 million people (14 percent) over the same period, which \\ncreated a related increase in the demand for goods.\\n\\nIn the AAPA survey, respondents were asked what they anticipated the \\nminimum cost would be over the next decade (through 2025) to upgrade \\nthe intermodal connections at their port so it could efficiently handle \\nall of their projected inbound and outbound cargo.\\nKey Survey Results Included:\\nNearly 80 percent of AAPA U.S. ports surveyed said they anticipate a \\nminimum $10 million investment being needed in their port\\'s intermodal \\nconnectors through 2025, while 30 percent anticipate at least $100 \\nmillion will be needed.\\n\\n  \\x01 These intermodal connectors, often referred to as the ``first and \\n        last mile\\'\\' of the freight transportation network, account for \\n        roughly 1,200 of the 57,000 miles in the national highway \\n        system. Many of these connectors are in various states of \\n        disrepair and face further deterioration, particularly as trade \\n        volumes continue to grow. Like links in a chain, these \\n        transportation connections with America\\'s seaports are critical \\n        to the overall freight network, and they are particularly \\n        vulnerable in large, congested metropolitan communities where \\n        commuters and freight share the same system. As the United \\n        States. takes a closer look at planning and investing in its \\n        freight grid, intermodal access points must be prioritized.\\n\\nLooking further at intermodal connectors, the AAPA survey asked \\nrespondents how much has congestion on these connectors over the past \\ndecade impacted their port\\'s productivity.\\n\\nOne-third of respondents said congestion on their port\\'s intermodal \\nconnectors over the past 10 years has caused port productivity to \\ndecline by 25 percent or more.\\n\\n  \\x01 MAP-21 made incremental steps in providing resources for improving \\n        intermodal connectors. Surface Transportation Program (STP) \\n        funds are now eligible for surface transportation \\n        infrastructure improvements in port terminals for direct \\n        intermodal interchange, transfer and port access. However, the \\n        competition for these funds is intense, as states have 27 other \\n        eligible funding activities in which to use these Federal \\n        funds.\\n\\n  \\x01 Among AAPA survey respondents, 33 percent said their port has \\n        applied for STP funds during the last 2 years. However, AAPA \\n        has also heard from ports that low success rates in securing \\n        funding has made it difficult for them to make long-term \\n        commitments for infrastructure projects. AAPA repeatedly hears \\n        from U.S. member ports that sustainable and reliable funding \\n        sources need to be available in order for them to invest and \\n        leverage funding into the connecting freight network.\\n\\n          Needed and Planned Investment in the Freight Network\\n\\nIn a 2012 AAPA survey, U.S. public ports and their private sector \\npartners reported plans to invest more than $9 billion each year for \\nthe next 5 years tomaintain and improve their infrastructure. However, \\nthis investment is not being adequately matched by a Federal Government \\ncommitment to improve the corresponding connecting infrastructure. Many \\nof the land-side connections to seaports are insufficient and outdated, \\nnegatively affecting the ports\\' ability to move cargo into and out of \\nthe U.S., and threatening our international competitiveness.\\nKey Survey Results Included:\\nThere is an identified current need of $28.9 billion in 125 port-\\nrelated freight network projects. These projects range from intermodal \\nconnectors, gateway and corridor projects, to marine highways and on-\\ndock rail projects.\\n\\nOf these 125 projects, there are 46 intermodal projects totaling $7.5 \\nbillion, and 34 Projects of National & Regional Significance totaling \\n$19.5 billion. Additionally, respondents identified 35 TIGER \\n(Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery) projects \\ntotaling $1.9 billion.\\n\\n  Since 2009 TIGER Funding Has Leveraged $700 Million for the Freight \\n                                Network\\n\\n  \\x01 Over the past 6 years, the Maritime Administration (MARAD) has \\n        coordinated 39 maritime TIGER projects, worth $500 million in \\n        federal funds.\\n\\n  \\x01 About $700 million in additional freight rail and federal TIGER \\n        projects have been awarded that also move maritime freight.\\n\\n  \\x01 TIGER is a multi-modal and multi-jurisdictional competitive grant \\n        program.\\n\\n             Building on the Planning Provisions of MAP-21\\n\\nThe 2012 MAP-21 surface transportation legislation required the USDOT \\nto encourage states to develop comprehensive immediate and long-term \\nfreight planning and investment plans, and to collaborate with \\nindividual states, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and \\nFreight Advisory Committees.\\n\\nIn addition to comprehensive freight plans, states were also encouraged \\nto establish freight advisory committees. Furthermore, MPOs were \\ndirected to set performance targets for freight and to integrate \\nfreight planning performance provisions into their overall planning \\nprocess.\\n\\nMAP-21 set into motion a useful process for communicating, planning and \\nultimately funding important freight projects. Ports are engaging in \\nthis process and in many ways have been leading the conversation. In \\nits The State of Freight survey, AAPA asked its U.S. member ports a \\nseries of questions on how they are building off the MAP-21 planning \\nprovisions and engaging with planning the freight network.\\nKey Survey Results Included:\\nSixty-three percent of survey respondents said their port is working \\ndirectly with its region\\'s MPO or Council of Governments (COG) in the \\ndevelopment and planning of a freight project that is either underway \\nor has recently been completed.\\n\\n  \\x01 From this response, AAPA learned that not only are two-thirds of \\n        its U.S. member ports engaging in the MPO planning process and \\n        actively including freight projects in their statewide or \\n        Metropolitan Transportation Improvement Program, these ports \\n        are also engaged in an ongoing dialogue with their regional \\n        planners.\\n\\n  \\x01 AAPA also learned from this part of the survey that the \\n        availability of TIGER funding has significantly driven U.S. \\n        public port engagement with the planning community over the \\n        years. Because of port eligibility for TIGER funding and \\n        coordination and planning requirements in the submission of \\n        projects, the annual TIGER process has served as a catalyst in \\n        bringing freight stakeholders to the table.\\n\\nSeventy-one percent of those surveyed said their port has participated \\nin the development of its statewide freight plan.\\n\\n  \\x01 According to the Federal Highway Administration\\'s (FHWA) Office of \\n        Freight Management and Operations, 42 states have worked with \\n        FHWA or are in various stages of development of their state \\n        freight plans. While many of these state freight plans are not \\n        yet MAP-21 compliant, the conversation on freight between \\n        states, stakeholders and the federal government is continuing.\\n\\nSixty-four percent of surveyed ports are members of a local freight \\nadvisory committee.\\n\\n  \\x01 MAP-21 encouraged the creation of local freight advisory committees \\n        to weigh in on the development of local and state freight \\n        plans. These freight advisories typically have a broad scope of \\n        membership, much like the National Freight Advisory Committee \\n        that is housed in the U.S. Department of Transportation. This \\n        is a place where the private sector continues to weigh in on \\n        the freight planning and funding process, which has been \\n        described as chambers of commerce for freight.\\n\\n  \\x01 An offshoot of this process has been a growing engagement and \\n        strong interest and understanding between ports, the private \\n        sector, and local and federal partners, in the development of \\n        creative Public-Private Partnership (P3) projects.\\n\\n                   Public-Private Partnerships (P3s)\\n\\nThe ability to facilitate business through port entry and exit gates, \\nand the ability to manage transportation logistics, make public ports \\nexcellent laboratories for P3-financed projects impacting the freight \\nnetwork.\\n\\nHowever, several federal financing tools that could be considered a \\ngood fit for ports have not had measurable impacts. Only five of the \\nAAPA U.S. ports surveyed have engaged in the federal Railroad \\nRehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) program, which is \\nsurprisingly low, given the overwhelming need and focus that ports \\nindicated they had for on-dock rail projects. In follow-up questions on \\nthe RRIF program, ports expressed a sense of frustration navigating the \\nprogram, and cited the need for a capital grants program to match up \\nwith RRIF loans to assist in facilitating and leveraging private sector \\ncapital.\\n\\nThe Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) \\nprogram is another example of a financing program underutilized by \\nAAPA\\'s U.S. member ports.\\nKey Survey Results Included:\\nEight percent of the survey respondents reported having utilized a \\nTIFIA loan for a port-related project.\\n\\n  \\x01 While freight rail and intermodal transfer center projects are \\n        eligible under TIFIA, many ports have reported having \\n        experienced difficulty with how USDOT interpreted their TIFIA \\n        applications, concluding that USDOT doesn\\'t encourage port-\\n        supported TIFIA projects.\\n\\nThirty-three percent reported using, or planning to use, P3s; 13 \\npercent identified using or planning to use Private Activity Bonds \\n(PABs); and 62 percent indicated they were using or planning to use \\nanother financing source.\\n\\n  \\x01 The significant use by U.S. ports of P3 financing suggests there is \\n        additional opportunity to rein in and leverage private-sector \\n        resources in building projects that impact the freight network.\\n\\n  \\x01 In late 2014, the USDOT Build America Transportation Investment \\n        Center (BATIC) put out a call for projects and more than 25 \\n        U.S. ports submitted P3 proposals.\\n\\n                              On-Dock Rail\\n\\nFor many ports, on-dock rail (rail track which is located immediately \\nnext to the dock front) offers a vital link to efficiently move goods \\ndirectly between ships and trains to get the goods to America\\'s \\nheartland and major distribution centers. In referencing on-dock rail, \\nBill Johnson, the former port director for Florida\\'s PortMiami, \\ntestified on January 28, 2015, before the Senate Commerce Committee, \\nsaying, ``Without interconnectivity, you cannot connect your port to \\nAmerica or the global economy.\\'\\'\\nKey Survey Results Included:\\nSeventy-three percent of AAPA U.S. member ports have on-dock rail, \\nwhile most others have rail tracks within terminals near docks, which \\nis often referred to as near-dock rail.\\n\\n  \\x01 However, U.S. ports\\' apparent rail infrastructure strength is \\n        misleading. Many port on-dock and near-dock rail systems are \\n        out-of-date and need to be significantly enhanced and \\n        reinforced, as well as integrated with new technology to \\n        accommodate rising shipping volumes.\\n\\n  \\x01 Having up-to-date on-dock and near-dock rail able to accommodate \\n        all the discretionary cargo that must be moved to and from a \\n        port\\'s hinterland is a big priority for U.S. seaports. The need \\n        is so urgent that several ports have purchased rail lines to \\n        ensure access to their existing freight network and for \\n        business development. Based on the survey responses, a majority \\n        of ports are engaged in upgrading and/or expanding their on-\\n        dock rail systems and have cited the need for Federal resources \\n        in assisting with on-dock rail investments.\\n\\n  \\x01 Even though improving port rail infrastructure is a priority for \\n        most ports, only 13 percent of survey respondents reported \\n        having applied for or are planning to use the RRIF program to \\n        pay for their projects. This may be due to what has been \\n        reported as a difficult application process to navigate. In the \\n        AAPA survey, respondents expressed a desire to revamp the RRIF \\n        program to make it easier to finance on-dock rail and other \\n        freight transportation infrastructure projects. They also \\n        indicated a desire that the RRIF program provide a capital \\n        grants aspect to work in tandem with its financing program.\\n\\n           Other Federal Options for Financing Port-Related \\n                       Infrastructure Development\\n\\nIn addition to facilitating the movement of cargo, seaports are also \\nstakeholders and partners in the communities in which they operate. In \\nthe U.S., public ports directly generate or influence the creation of \\nmillions of jobs, are environmental stewards and play a vibrant \\nsocioeconomic role in the communities they serve. While the condition \\nof the air, land and water surrounding these public ports is important \\nto those who work and do business in the respective communities, it\\'s \\nequally as important to those who work or do business at the ports \\nthemselves.\\n\\nIn addition to infrastructure investments, ports partner with the \\nFederal Government to fund programs that reduce diesel emissions and \\ncreate economic opportunities through partnerships with the Economic \\nDevelopment Administration (EDA). To illustrate, the final question in \\nAAPA\\'s survey asked respondents if their port had ever applied for or \\nreceived funding from Diesel Emission Reduction Act (DERA) grants, \\nCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program grants \\n(CMAQ), or the Surface Transportation Program (STP) or Economic \\nDevelopment Administration (EDA) grants.\\nKey Survey Results Included:\\nFifty-seven percent of the AAPA U.S. member ports surveyed have applied \\nthrough the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for DERA funding, and \\n43 percent have applied for CMAQ funding to pay for reducing emissions \\nand congestion while improving air quality in and around their ports.\\n\\nForty-five percent have applied through the U.S. Department of Commerce \\nfor EDA grants by partnering with a regional academic institution and a \\nlocal government authority, while 33 percent have applied for Federal \\nhighway STP funding to improve their port\\'s intermodal connections.\\n\\n                               Conclusion\\n\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n\\n.epsAmerica\\'s freight network is vast and evolving. It\\'s a living grid \\nand economic lifeline for the country; from small towns to major \\nmetropolitan areas, from farming regions to technology centers.\\n\\nAt its heart are America\\'s seaports, which handle approximately $6 \\nbillion worth of goods to and from overseas markets every day. These \\ngoods come in all shapes and sizes. Apparel and consumer electronics \\nare shipped in standardized steel containers. Cars and trucks are \\ndriven on and off ships. Farm harvests are conveyed into the hulls of \\nvessels. Liquids are moved by pipeline. Gaseous products are shipped in \\npressurized tanks. Project cargoes, like wind turbines and electrical \\ngenerators, require special handling. These different cargo types \\nrequire different transport modes to get them from shore to ship, and \\nship to shore. For the freight network to operate smoothly and \\nefficiently, it must seamlessly connect commerce centers in every \\ncommunity, state and territory.\\n\\nAs indicated in AAPA\\'s 2015 The State of Freight survey, investment in \\nAmerica\\'s port connection infrastructure is an urgent national \\npriority. There is a path forward. This survey documents and \\nillustrates the freight planning successes that resulted from the TIGER \\napplication process. Survey results show how MAP-21 built upon TIGER\\'s \\ntargeted investments with the various State freight plans and with \\nongoing input of the individual States\\' freight advisory committees.\\n\\nThe survey also, for the first time, documents from the ports\\' \\nperspective the requisite capital investments that are needed to \\nmaintain and enhance a 21st century freight network. These investments \\ninclude ``first and last mile\\'\\' connector and gateway projects that, \\nwhen viewed collectively, represent a strategic investment in the \\nnational transportation system, the national economy, as well as all of \\nthe individual enterprises and people who make the nation great.\\n\\nThis survey is a strong first step towards identifying the critical \\ninfrastructure needs of America\\'s seaports, however more must be done. \\nAAPA will continue to gather input from the industry and work with our \\npartners to ensure that investing in our Nation\\'s freight \\ntransportation system is a national priority.

My name is John Cox, and I serve as President of the American \\nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), and \\nas Director of the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT). It is \\nmy honor to provide this Statement for the Record on behalf of AASHTO, \\nwhich represents the State departments of transportation (State DOTs) \\nof all 50 States, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.\\n\\nFor almost 60 years, the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) provided stable, \\nreliable, and substantial highway and transit funding. However, over \\nthe past 7 years this has not been the case. Since 2008, almost $62 \\nbillion have been transferred from the General Fund to the HTF to keep \\nit solvent. Recently--and retreading a path that we all have walked \\ndown before--the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced \\nthat the Highway Account of the HTF will likely run out of money later \\nthis summer. If this is allowed to happen, States may not be reimbursed \\nfor work they have already paid for. In addition, failure to ensure the \\nsolvency of the HTF will force States to drastically reduce the \\nobligation of new Federal highway funds in Fiscal Year 2016.\\n\\nAlmost half of capital investments made by States on our Nation\\'s \\nroads, bridges, and transit systems are supported by the HTF. Without \\nthis strong Federal-State partnership, State DOTs will not be able to \\nplay their part in building and maintaining the national transportation \\nnetwork on which our economy relies to be competitive in the global \\nmarketplace.\\nFAILURE TO REIMBURSE STATES FOR PRIOR OBLIGATIONS\\nThe Federal-aid Highway Program currently provides about $38 billion a \\nyear to State DOTs for important road and bridge projects across the \\ncountry. These funds are derived from contract authority, a unique form \\nof Federal budgetary authority well-suited for infrastructure projects \\nthat require a multi-year construction timeline. It is critical to note \\nthat the dollars obligated under this program represent the Federal \\nGovernment\\'s legal commitment and promise to pay--or more accurately--\\nreimburse the States for the Federal share of a project\\'s eligible \\ncosts.\\n\\nUnder this reimbursement framework, States only receive funding from \\nthe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) when work is completed on a \\nproject and the State submits a request for reimbursement. States \\ntypically receive reimbursement electronically from FHWA the same day \\npayments to the contractor are made.\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\nIt is currently estimated by the USDOT and Department of the Treasury \\nthat the Highway Account of the HTF is likely to run out of cash by \\nearly September of this year. Prior to reaching this point of \\ninsolvency, FHWA will be forced to institute emergency cash management \\nprocedures in order to slow down reimbursements to States for costs \\nalready incurred on highway and transit projects.\\n\\nAs Congress was faced with the same HTF insolvency crisis last summer, \\nFHWA announced that under their proposed emergency cash management plan \\nat the time, States\\' reimbursements would be capped at a drastically \\nreduced amount relative to the full amount owed. This cap would have \\nbeen determined by the ever-dwindling amount of cash in the HTF \\naccessible by FHWA twice a month. Under this situation where FHWA \\ncannot cover 100 percent of the bills received, States would have been \\nleft to provide the cash cushion--by whatever means necessary such as \\nshort-term borrowing, standby lines of credit, reliance on the state\\'s \\ngeneral fund--for payments already made. Furthermore, FHWA incurs \\ninterest liability if a State pays out its own funds for Federal \\nassistance program purposes, which would only exacerbate the cash \\nshortfall in the HTF. Given the urgency of this situation, Congress \\npassed the Highway and Transportation Funding Act, which was enacted on \\nAugust 8, 2014, to provide $10.8 billion to the HTF.\\n\\nBecause States count on prompt payment from the Federal Government to \\nbe able manage cash flow and pay contractors for completed work, any \\ndelay in reimbursement from FHWA will cause a significant disruption in \\nall States. And in turn, contractors that rely on prompt payment from \\nthe State would be unable to pay their employees and suppliers. As you \\ncan imagine, such a devastating scenario will send shockwaves \\nthroughout the transportation community and all other industries \\nsupported by Federal infrastructure investment.\\n\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\nDEVASTATING IMPACT TO STATES OF A HIGHWAY TRUST FUND SHORTFALL IN FY \\n        2016\\nEven if FHWA is able to keep the Highway Account solvent by delaying \\nreimbursements to States this summer, it will not address the \\nunderlying structural problem. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \\nestimates that yearly HTF receipts will be $17 billion less than HTF \\nspending annually over the next 10 years (FY 2016-2025). In order to \\nkeep the HTF solven beyond this fiscal year, AASHTO estimates that \\nStates will have to significantly reduce new Federal highway funding in \\nfiscal year 2016--going from $40 billion to $4 billion. Even with \\nvirtually no new highway funding in fiscal year 2016, there remains a \\npossibility that FHWA will still have to alter its reimbursement \\nprocedures in fiscal year 2016 to be able to pay for prior-year \\nobligations.\\n\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\nHistorically, Federal highway funding has accounted for approximately \\n45 percent of what State DOTs spend on highway and bridge capital \\nimprovements. This means a significant portion of much-needed highway \\nand transit projects--projects that underpin economic development and \\nimprove the quality of life--in every community and Congressional \\ndistrict will either be delayed or cancelled outright. Such cutbacks on \\ncontract lettings would mean missed opportunities to pare down the \\nbacklog of investment needs, while causing a negative domino effect on \\nconstruction industry employment exactly when it is starting to rebound \\nafter being one of the hardest hit segments in the recent recession. \\nFurthermore, ramping up and down construction activities--including \\nequipment and labor resource management--due to the instability of the \\nFederal program would represent an extremely wasteful exercise and \\nimpose heavy opportunity costs for the entire transportation industry \\nand the nation as a whole.\\nADDITIONAL REVENUES NEEDED JUST TO MAINTAIN CURRENT INVESTMENT LEVELS\\nAs a major disruption to the HTF remains on the horizon, the \\nCongressionally chartered National Surface Transportation Policy and \\nRevenue Study Commission projected annual Federal capital investment \\nneeds at $225 billion for the next 50 years. When compared to the \\ncurrent funding level of about $90 billion, there is a significant \\ninvestment deficit in surface transportation infrastructure. In order \\nto sustain the long tradition of robust national investment in \\ntransportation, we must ensure the HTF\\'s looming cash shortfall is \\naddressed with solutions that enable sustainable program funding not \\njust beyond this summer or fiscal year 2016, but for the long term.\\n\\nWhile the HTF continues to derive about 90 percent of its revenues from \\ntaxes on motor fuels, these taxes are facing an increasingly \\nunsustainable long-term future, therefore placing the viability of the \\nHTF in question. Motor fuel taxes at the Federal level were last \\nincreased to the current rates of 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline \\nand 24.4 cents for diesel 22 years ago in 1993. As a static excise tax \\nlevied per gallon, taxes on motor fuel have lost a significant share of \\nits purchasing power. Compared to the Consumer Price Index, the gas tax \\nhad lost 39 percent of its purchasing power by 2014, and is expected to \\nlose more than half of its value--or 52 percent--by 2024. This loss of \\npurchasing power is unusual considering the increase in nominal cost of \\nvirtually all other aspects of the economy.\\n\\n\\n  Exhibit 4.

This situation is not new, as the HTF will \\nhave--by the expiration of the current surface transportation program \\nextension on July 31, 2015--relied on a series of General Fund \\ntransfers amounting to almost $62 billion since 2008 to close this gap. \\nBut this annual cash imbalance is expected to only get worse, and the \\nHTF cannot incur a negative balance unlike the General Fund.\\n\\nThis situation leads to three possible scenarios for later this year:\\n\\n  1.  Provide additional General Fund transfers to the HTF in order to \\n        maintain the current level of highway and transit investment \\n        and to meet prior-year obligations;\\n  2.

Conversely, without \\nprioritizing our nation\\'s infrastructure needs, deteriorating \\nconditions can produce a severe drag on the overall economy. In light \\nof new capacity and upkeep needs for every State in the country, the \\ncurrent trajectory of the HTF--the backbone of Federal surface \\ntransportation program--is simply unsustainable as it will have \\ninsufficient resources to meet all of its obligations later this \\nsummer, resulting in steadily accumulating shortfalls.\\n\\nWhichever revenue tools are utilized, at a minimum, it is crucial to \\nidentify solutions that will sustain the MAP-21 level of surface \\ntransportation investment in real terms. Given the devastating impact \\nthat potential delays on Federal reimbursements to State DOTs combined \\nwith a virtual elimination of Federal surface transportation \\nobligations in fiscal year 2016 can have on the economy and \\nconstruction industry employment, we look forward to assisting you and \\nthe rest of your Senate colleagues in finding and implementing a viable \\nset of revenue solutions to the HTF not only for later this year, but \\nfor the long term.\\n\\n\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n            American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC)\\n\\n                        100 Years of Excellence\\n\\n                        Statement for the Record\\n\\n                    U.S. Senate Committee on Finance\\n\\n         Hearing on Challenges to the Future of Highway Funding\\n\\n                        Thursday, June 18, 2015\\n\\nChairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, and Members of the Committee:\\n\\nOn behalf of the American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC)--the \\nvoice of America\\'s engineering industry--thank you for holding this \\nhearing today on options for providing long-term funding certainty for \\nfederal surface transportation programs. There are few more important \\ntopics that this committee will address this year, because federal \\ninvestment in transportation infrastructure plays an essential role in \\nprotecting public health and safety, promoting commerce, and keeping \\nAmerica economically competitive.\\n\\nAs you know, nearly $63 billion has been transferred into the Highway \\nTrust Fund since 2008 because of the failure to address systemic \\nfunding shortfalls with real revenue solutions. Absent Congressional \\naction, the balance of the Trust Fund will soon be depleted again, \\nimperiling more state and local projects with continued uncertainty. \\nMore than $1 billion in planned improvements have already been \\ncancelled or delayed because of the uncertainty over future federal \\ncontributions, and many more projects are sure to be shelved as this \\nproblem persists. These projects will only get more expensive due to \\nthe delay.\\n\\nEngineering is a leading indicator of economic performance, \\nparticularly in the building and development sectors. When state and \\nlocal transportation agencies can\\'t develop long-term funding programs, \\nour firms can\\'t hire engineers or make equipment purchases necessary \\nfor planning, designing, and delivering those projects. When our firms \\naren\\'t working on pre-construction activities, those projects can\\'t \\nmove on to construction, which means fewer construction workers \\nworking, fewer machines being built and sold, less economic activity \\nbeing generated, and ultimately, goods not getting to market and U.S. \\nbusinesses not being competitive.\\n\\nAccording to the ACEC Engineering Business Index quarterly survey of \\nengineering firm CEOs (www.acec.org/publications/engineering-business-\\nindex/), nearly one in five respondents (19 percent) expect the \\ntransportation on market to worsen over the next year. Only 40 percent \\nanticipate that public transportation markets will improve. In the Fall \\n2014 EBI survey, three in four respondents (77 percent) expressed doubt \\nthat the U.S. transportation infrastructure will regain its status as a \\nworld leader. This disheartening pessimism bodes poorly for the \\nprospects of broader domestic economic growth, and it is firmly rooted \\nin Congressional failure to enact sustainable capital investments.\\n\\nWe recognize the need to look for new ways to fund road, bridge, and \\ntransit projects because of the long-term challenges posed by the rise \\nin alternative-fueled vehicles and increased fuel efficiency. We have \\nendorsed a range of options, including mileage-based user fees, \\nwidespread tolling, new freight charges, and revenues from increased \\ndomestic energy production. Numerous blue ribbon commissions have \\nexplored these options in depth, and they should all be on the table in \\nyour deliberations.\\n\\nWhile they all have merit, the reality is that none of these options is \\na near-term solution for funding a 6-year bill.\\n\\nThe simplest and most effective action Congress can take to stabilize \\nthe Highway Trust Fund is increasing and indexing federal gas and \\ndiesel taxes. These user fees have been the basis of the federal-aid \\nprogram for decades, but failure to adjust the rates since 1993 has \\ndiminished their purchasing power by 40 percent and led to the fiscal \\ncrisis of the Trust Fund that we face today. A modest increase in motor \\nfuels charges--a measure endorsed by highway users and the trucking \\nindustry representing those paying into the system--is a relatively \\nsmall price to pay for improving safety, enhancing mobility, and \\nensuring American competitiveness.\\n\\nThe alternative is to continue on the same path of short-term patches, \\nwhich is fiscally irresponsible, relying on government borrowing and \\nbudget gimmicks.\\n\\nContinued instability and underinvestment in transportation \\ninfrastructure will only hamper economic growth. Deteriorating roads \\nand bridges and worsening congestion have raised the price of doing \\nbusiness through increased maintenance costs, wasted fuel and delayed \\nshipments. Last year, our economy was crippled by $121 billion in \\ncongestion costs, or $818 per U.S. commuter, and an additional $230 \\nbillion in economic costs from accidents. By contrast, every dollar \\ninvested in highway and transit development generates between $4-8 in \\neconomic output.\\n\\nIt is past time for Congress to advance a sustainable, long-term \\nsolution to the Highway Trust Fund, beginning with an increase in \\nexisting user fees that help pave the way for alternative solutions \\ndown the road. Our industry and our economy and our citizens cannot \\nwait for a combination of unrelated tax changes that may or may not \\nmaterialize later this year. Congress must act now, starting with \\naction in this committee. Predictable and growing revenue sources, \\nparticularly user fees, will give state and local agencies the funding \\ncertainty they need to plan and deliver infrastructure investments that \\nfoster economic growth and enhance our quality of life.\\n\\nACEC members--numbering more than 5,000 firms representing more than \\n500,000 employees throughout the country--are engaged in a wide range \\nof engineering works that propel the nation\\'s economy and enhance and \\nsafeguard America\\'s quality of life.

More than \\n10,500 service providers and suppliers are also associated with AGC, \\nall through a nationwide network of chapters. These firms, both union \\nand open shop, engage in the construction of buildings, shopping \\ncenters, factories, industrial facilities, warehouses, highways, \\nbridges, tunnels, airports, water works facilities, waste treatment \\nfacilities, dams, water conservation projects, defense facilities, \\nmulti-family housing projects, municipal utilities, and other \\nimprovements to real property. Most are small and closely held \\nbusinesses.\\n\\nSince the creation of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, the \\nHighway Trust Fund has been supported by revenue collected from users. \\nThis ``pay-as-you-go\\'\\' system has served America well, allowing States \\nto plan, construct and improve America\\'s surface transportation \\ninfrastructure. AGC has long-supported maintaining the user-fee model \\nfor providing Highway Trust Fund revenue--including taxes on gasoline \\nand diesel fuel--and encourages Congress to act immediately to provide \\nthe revenue necessary to fill the Highway Trust Fund revenue gap we \\nwill face this summer and beyond. User fees and taxes have not been \\nincreased in over 20 years. Since 2008, the revenue going into the \\nHighway Trust Fund has fallen short of what is needed to address \\nAmerica\\'s infrastructure needs and keep funding at existing levels. \\nThis has resulted in the Highway Trust Fund receiving over $63 billion \\nin transfers from the general fund simply to meet its obligations.\\nImmediate Highway Trust Fund Shortfall\\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) the Highway Trust \\nFund will be unable to meet all of its obligations in July or August. \\nCBO also estimates that with no change in estimated receipts into the \\nHighway Trust Fund, in 2016, all of the revenue credited to the fund \\nwill be needed to meet obligations made before that year. Simply put, \\nwithout additional revenue the trust fund will be unable to support any \\nnew Federal obligations in 2016, resulting in a 100 percent cut to new \\nhighway and transit funding. In order to avoid such draconian cuts and \\nsimply maintain current funding levels, $16 billion in additional \\nrevenue either through a gas tax increase or other user related fees or \\na transfer from the general fund will be necessary. According to CBO, \\nthe gap between trust fund receipts and obligations beyond 2016 is $11 \\nto $18 billion annually.\\nNeed for Certainty\\nBecause of the current state of trust fund finances, Congress must take \\nsteps to maintain certainty in program continuity. The construction \\nindustry makes decisions about investments in new equipment and in \\nretaining and training a workforce based on its best projection about \\nwhere the market will be over the long term. Without the knowledge that \\na continuous and growing market is on the horizon, contractors will not \\nmake the investments necessary to carry out this program\\'s objectives. \\nThis is particularly true for small businesses, which typically have \\nless operating capital to invest, thus are more risk-adverse with their \\ncapital. This trait is also magnified by the economic conditions, which \\nmake risk reduction a company\\'s top priority. This hurts the program as \\nmuch as it does the industry. Efficiency and productivity increases \\nwhen contractors can project a steady future market in which to work. \\nThis helps lower costs, and allows for a better constructed project \\nbecause new equipment and improved technology improves the final \\nproject.\\n\\nThe stop gap funding measures since 2008 have caused uncertainty in the \\ntransportation construction market place. Congress\\'s inability to make \\nthe difficult decisions and provide real, growing and sustainable \\nrevenue for the Highway Trust Fund has resulted in states throughout \\nthe county delaying or cancelling much needed transportation \\nconstruction projects. AGC members from Georgia to Wyoming, Tennessee \\nand South Dakota among others are seeing theirstate departments of \\ntransportation let fewer and fewer jobs. Nearly $2 billion in vital \\ntransportation construction projects has been delayed or cancelled \\nbecause Congress will not act and fix the Highway Trust Fund.\\nFederal Role\\nNot only has Congress failed to act on addressing the solvency of the \\nHighway Trust Fund, some want to strip away most Federal funding for \\nsurface transportation projects, essentially eliminating the Federal \\nGovernment\\'s constitutionally mandated role in promoting interstate \\ncommerce (commonly known as devolution). Legislative proposals such as \\nthe Transportation Enhancement Act (TEA) would reduce funding for the \\nfederal-aid highway program by more than 80 percent, with no \\nconsideration of the impact on state and local governments or private \\nindustry. It also calls for the elimination of the Federal transit \\nprogram, taking more than $8 billion from state and local public \\ntransportation agencies, which rely on federal funds for more than 43 \\npercent of their capital spending.\\n\\nWhile TEA purports to retain a federal role in maintaining the \\nInterstate System, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation \\n(U.S. DOT), Interstates require at least $17 billion in annual \\ninvestment to simply sustain current levels of maintenance, and more \\nthan $33 billion per year to improve system conditions. Furthermore, \\nthe National Highway System, which carries 55 percent of total vehicle \\nmiles traveled and 97 percent of truck miles, also requires an annual \\ninvestment of $75 billion, according to U.S. DOT. TEA doesn\\'t \\n``empower\\'\\' states; it burdens them with 90 percent of the fiscal \\nresponsibility for supporting highways that the federal government \\ncurrently helps to maintain. It would also have a devastating impact on \\npublic transportation systems that help to alleviate highway \\ncongestion, reduce emissions and provide critical transportation \\noptions to underserved populations.\\n\\nA further burden on states lies in the amount of revenue that they \\nwould have to raise to replace the absence of federal transportation \\nfunding. On average federal dollars are responsible for 52 percent of \\nstates capital budgets for transportation. If states replaced the lost \\nrevenue with an increase in their fuel taxes, on average their gas \\ntaxes would have to increase by roughly 23 cents by 2020 and some \\nstates would have to raise their taxes by more than 30 cents just to \\nmaintain the current level of funding.\\n\\nTEA and other ``devolution\\'\\' proposals do not bring any new money to \\nthe table so they are not a solution to the long-term transportation \\nneeds of our county. Congress must continue to reject such proposals \\nand instead work in a bipartisan, bicameral way to enact a long-term \\nsustainable revenue source for the Highway Trust Fund.\\nMotor Fuels Tax\\nAGC believes that there is no easy solution for addressing our \\ntransportation investment deficit. The level of investment provided by \\nthe Highway Trust Fund should be increased to address mounting needs. \\nAn increase in revenue is necessary just to keep up with inflation \\nadditional funding is also needed to address the backlog of \\ntransportation investment needs. Numerous authoritative reports have \\ncome to the conclusion that, for the foreseeable future, the Federal \\nmotor fuels tax is the best method for funding transportation \\ninfrastructure investment and that the motor fuels tax needs to be \\nincreased. SAFETEA-LU established two national commissions to look at \\nthe future of the Federal transportation programs and to make \\nrecommendations on paying for these needs into the future. Both \\nCommissions were appointed with bi-partisan membership and included \\ntransportation experts and individuals representing businesses and \\nother users of the system.\\n\\nIn 2011, the Simpson Bowles Commission recommended a 15-cent per gallon \\ngas and diesel tax increase plus inflation. In addition to Simpson-\\nBowles, Congressman Early Blumenauer (D-OR) has introduced legislation \\n(H.R. 680) that would increase the gas tax by 15 cents over 3 years (it \\ncurrently has 32 cosponsors) , while Congressman Jim Renacci (R-OH) and \\nCongressman Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) have a bill (H.R. 846) that would pay \\nfor the next surface transportation authorization with indexing the \\ncurrent gas and diesel taxes to inflation and subsequently increasing \\nthem by an amount that would maintain current finding levels if \\nCongress failed to address the long-term solvency of the Highway Trust \\nFund (31 cosponsors). AGC supports all three of the above proposals.\\nAGC Recommendations\\nRecognizing the need to look at all viable options to fund the highway \\ntrust fund, AGC along with our partners in the Transportation \\nConstruction Coalition (TCC) have been advocating for over a year that \\nCongress look at other revenue options--that maintain the user-pays \\nmodel--that would be viable. This is our all of the above approach.\\n\\nThe chart below (and attached at the end) shows the $102 billion \\nshortfall from 2015-2020 between the revenue going into the Highway \\nTrust Fund and projected outlays of the fund assuming current funding \\nlevels plus inflationary increases. The TCC is proposing a combination \\nof new and existing user fees currently being collected at the Federal \\nand state level as options to the 6-year shortfall and create a basis \\nfor much needed future growth. In addition, we look beyond 2020 and \\nprovide the next generation of revenue options to fund growth that \\naddresses the needs of our transportation network.\\n\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\nThe proposed revenue options include:\\n\\n  \\x01  Dedicating 15 percent of Custom Duties currently collected to the \\n        Highway Trust Fund--The U.S. has recognized the connection \\n        between infrastructure investment and international commerce \\n        since the Lighthouse Act of 1789 during the first Congress. \\n        Customs duties are imposed at varying rates on various imported \\n        goods passing through U.S. international gateways and currently \\n        go to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. A number of \\n        interest groups as well as the SAFETEA-LU policy commission \\n        have suggested that given the role transportation \\n        infrastructure plays in facilitating the import of goods, a \\n        portion of current customs duties should be allocated to \\n        support transportation investment.\\n\\n  \\x01  $5 Driver License Fee--The annual driver\\'s license fee would be a \\n        federal surcharge on current state license fees. All states \\n        charge a fee which in some cases simply covers the cost of \\n        administering the licensing programs. In many states however, \\n        license fees also are used as a source of funding for \\n        transportation or other purposes. Currently 48 states have a \\n        registration fee and all but a handful use the proceeds for \\n        road improvement projects. This fee, as with others, should be \\n        indexed to CPI for inflation.\\n\\n  \\x01  $5 Light Duty Tire Tax--Similar to the existing heavy vehicle tire \\n        fee, this fee would apply to tires that do not exceed maximum \\n        capacity of 3,500 pounds. This would be a national tire tax on \\n        both new cars and replacement tires. This fee, as with others, \\n        should indexed to CPI for inflation.\\n\\n  \\x01  Increase Heavy Vehicle Use Tax--Currently this tax is levied on \\n        all trucks 55,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) or greater. \\n        The tax rate is $100 plus $22 for each 1,000 pounds of GVW in \\n        excess of 55,000 up to a maximum annual fee of $550 (thus all \\n        trucks with GVW greater than 75,000 pounds pay the maximum).\\n\\n  \\x01  $10 Light Duty Registration Fee--All states impose annual vehicles \\n        registration and related fees, and at least half the states \\n        raise more than a quarter of their dedicated transportation \\n        revenues through this mechanism. The structure of the \\n        registration fee varies widely, from a flat per vehicle fee to \\n        a schedule of rates based on factors such as vehicle type, \\n        weight, age, horsepower, and value. This increase in would \\n        apply a Federal surcharge to state registration fees. We \\n        propose that this and all other fees are indexed to CPI.\\n\\n  \\x01  10 Cent Diesel Tax Increase--Increasing the tax on diesel only is \\n        modeled after the inland water ways trust fund proposals that \\n        was included the ABLE Act which was signed into law last \\n        December. The barge operators convinced Members of Congress to \\n        increase the fuel tax that they pay to fund infrastructure \\n        investment.\\n\\n  \\x01  Index Diesel and Gas Tax--When these user fees were last increased \\n        in 1993 they did not include any adjustments for inflations. If \\n        you measure the federal gas tax rate today relative to road \\n        construction costs, the tax has lost 38 percent of its value \\n        since 1993.\\n\\n  \\x01  Oil Leasing on Federal Lands--Expanding oil and gas drilling on \\n        federal lands and in the Outer Continental Shelf and dedicating \\n        the royalties to the Highway Trust.\\n\\n  \\x01  Deemed Repatriation--Some members of Congress have proposed to tax \\n        the profits of U.S. corporations on earnings made outside of \\n        the United States. Several different ways have been suggested \\n        on how to accomplish this, including a ``tax holiday.\\'\\' This \\n        proposal is for ``deemed repatriation,\\'\\' taxing corporate \\n        profit made outside the U.S. at an 8.75 percent rate, \\n        regardless of whether the profits are returned to the U.S.\\n\\nAgain, if Congress continues to fail to increase the user fees for \\ngasoline and diesel fuel, they should look to these options as \\nalternatives that would maintain the traditional user pays model for \\nour federal transportation programs.\\nConclusion\\nAGC believes that the federal government should double-down on its \\ninfrastructure investment, not reduce it or shift the responsibility to \\nthe states. The long-term benefits from transportation investment are \\nwell documented. Every dollar invested in Highway Trust Fund programs \\nreturns 74 cents in tax revenue and adds $1.80 to $2.00 to Gross \\nDomestic Product (GDP). The ``user fee\\'\\' principle is well respected \\nand easily understood. The Highway Trust Fund concept of fiscal \\nresponsibility served the country well for 50 years until the Congress \\ndecided it was more acceptable to take money from the general fund than \\nincrease the user fee to cover the annual expenditures from the Highway \\nTrust Fund. The United States has face the reality that they have been \\nunder investing in our transportation systems for far too long and the \\nimpact is now being felt in every state and in most towns. With the \\ninterstate system beyond capacity and design life, this underinvestment \\nis costing U.S. businesses and individual\\'s time and money. Providing \\ncontinued support for traditional funding mechanisms and finding new \\nuser based options is necessary to address this dire situation.\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n              Explanation of Shortfall and Revenue Options\\n\\nShortfall--The 2015-2020 shortfall represents the discrepancies between \\nthe revenue going into the HTF and the projected outlays of the trust \\nfund assuming current funding levels plus inflationary increases. The \\nCongressional Budget Office projects that without Congressional action \\nthe HTF will be unable to meet all of its obligations in 2015 and will \\nbe unable to support any new projects in fiscal year 2016.\\n\\nRevenue Options--TCC is proposing a combination of new and existing \\nuser fees currently being collected at the federal and state level as \\noptions to fill the 6-year HTF shortfall and create a basis for future \\ngrowth.

Our members represent millions of motorists and employers \\nwho want our roads to be safe, efficient, and reliable.\\n\\nAlthough we represent road users, we strongly support the principle \\nthat users should pay their own way for infrastructure improvements. In \\nreturn for fully funding the Highway Trust Fund, road users deserve to \\nbenefit directly from guaranteed investments in roads and bridges \\nthrough multi-year highway bills. This type of system has traditionally \\nenabled the United States to outperform competitors by efficiently \\nmoving logistics over our vast network of toll-free Interstate \\nhighways. It is hard to imagine how much poorer our country would be \\nwithout the investments of the past generation into modern roads.\\n\\nThe Federal role in road funding and the user-pays/user-benefits \\nprinciple has been an important, principled approach to investment. The \\nconservative user-fee concept dates back as early as 1776, when British \\nphilosopher and political scientist Adam Smith endorsed national \\nfunding of roads in The Wealth of Nations, provided that users pay \\ntheir costs.\\n\\nFrom 1956 to 2008, the Highway Trust Fund was exclusively funded with \\nuser taxes. Since 2008, deficits have repeatedly threatened the \\nsolvency of the fund. Congress has responded by voting time and again \\nto prevent highway funding cuts. At the same time, Congress has failed \\nto find a fiscally sustainable solution to the revenue shortfall. Over \\n$60 billion in transfers from the General Fund of the Treasury has kept \\nhighway funding flat--preventing cuts but also creating doubts as to \\nthe ability of Washington to pass a long-term highway bill that can \\nfund the major highway and bridge projects critical to public safety, \\neconomic growth, freight reliability, and congestion relief. Without a \\nsustainable solution, State transportation departments can\\'t plan and \\nimplement the most important projects.\\n\\nAs Congress debates a path forward to funding a long-term 6-year \\nhighway bill, we would be grateful for almost any source of funding to \\nreverse the decline in our road conditions. But Congress should do more \\nthan prevent cuts; it should fairly raise enough revenue to make \\nsignificant inroads in the backlog of national highway and bridge \\nneeds.\\n\\nWe urge Congress to renew their historic support for the user fee \\napproach to restore a sustainable Highway Trust Fund. We urge \\npolicymakers in other Committees to ensure that the programs are \\ntransparent, environmental reviews are streamlined, and wasteful \\ndiversions are minimized or eliminated. If Congress is to raise the \\nfunds to sustain a national highway program, the spending out of that \\nfund must be focused on addressing our major national highway needs. We \\nurge Members to consider the findings of two separate Congressionally-\\nchartered commissioned that studied these issues over the past decade \\nand develop a long-term financial sustainability model of growing the \\ntrust fund with user-based revenue.\\n\\nIn closing, what is currently occurring would certainly have \\nembarrassed Presidents Lincoln, Eisenhower, and Reagan--all of whom \\nenvisioned and supported a major federal role for transportation \\ninfrastructure. It is time for a bold, brave and bipartisan solution \\nand this Congress can certainly get it done.\\n\\nThe members and staff of The Highway Users look forward to working with \\nMembers of Congress to restore and grow the Highway Trust Fund and urge \\nimmediate action to enact a long-term highway bill this year.

This integrated network of \\npublic transportation services is an essential component of our \\nnation\\'s overall transportation system. Public transportation provides \\nmobility that significantly contributes to national goals for global \\neconomic competitiveness, congestion mitigation, energy conservation, \\nenvironmental sustainability, and emergency preparedness. APTA urges \\nthe Committee to increase the dedicated revenues that go into the \\nHighway Trust Fund, so that Congress can pass a surface transportation \\nbill that provides predictable funding growth under a multi-year \\nauthorization bill.\\n\\n                               ABOUT APTA\\n\\n    The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) is a \\nnonprofit, international association of nearly 1,500 public and private \\nmember organizations, including transit systems and commuter, intercity \\nand high-speed rail operators; planning, design, construction, and \\nfinance firms; product and service providers; academic institutions; \\ntransit associations and state departments of transportation. APTA \\nmembers serve the public interest by providing safe, efficient, and \\neconomical public transportation services and products. More than 90 \\npercent of the people using public transportation in the United States \\nand Canada are served by APTA member systems. In accordance with the \\nNational Infrastructure Protection Plan, APTA has been recognized by \\nthe Department of Homeland Security as serving in the capacity of the \\nMass Transit Sector Coordinating Council (SCC).\\n\\n                                OVERVIEW\\n\\n    Public transportation exists in all 50 states and the District of \\nColumbia and U.S. territories. The nation\\'s public transportation \\nsystems are an integral part of the nation\\'s surface transportation \\nsystem. Transit provides an alternative way to get to jobs, education, \\nhealthcare and social activities in every community, it improves the \\nefficiency of the existing roadway system in metro areas by reducing \\nthe number of cars on the road and the resulting traffic congestion. \\nLess congestion reduces costs for businesses that transport goods and \\nconsumers who buy those goods. Public transportation is important to \\ncommunities of all sizes, from large metropolitan regions to small \\ncities and rural communities. Less urban states and smaller cities \\ndepend on the Federal transit program to pay for a larger share of \\ntheir transit capital investments than more urban areas, and they also \\nrely on federal funds to pay for an important share of the costs \\nassociated with providing service.\\n\\n    To meet the demands of our nation\\'s aging infrastructure network, \\ngrowing urban population, and changing travel and commuting patterns, a \\nrenewed long-term federal commitment to public transportation is \\nessential. Currently, system needs far surpass resources from all \\nlevels of government. At the federal level, fuel taxes dedicated to the \\nMass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund, last raised in 1993, \\nhave lost more than 37 percent of their purchasing power. APTA urges \\nthe Committee to increase the dedicated revenues that go into the \\nHighway Trust Fund, so that Congress can pass a surface transportation \\nbill that provides for the growth of predictable federal funding under \\na multi-year authorization bill.\\n\\n    Since the expiration of TEA-21 in 2003, we have now had 25 short-\\nterm extensions, lasting a little more than 4 years authorization under \\nSAFETEA-LU, and a bit more than 2 years under MAP-21. More recently, \\nfederal transit funding has grown only minimally, from $10.231 billion \\nin fiscal year 2009 to $10.692 billion in fiscal year 2014. The \\nuncertainty of recent federal authorizing laws and lack of predictable \\nfunding of the federal transit program have made it nearly impossible \\nfor the industry to keep the system in a state of good repair, replace \\nthe aging infrastructure and fleets, and address the growing demand for \\nservice. Short-term authorizations increase project costs and decrease \\ncertainty for long-term planning.\\n\\n    While growing communities compete for limited funds to build a \\nvariety of new fixed guideway systems (BRT, light rail, trolley, heavy \\nrail and commuter rail), and transit ridership continues to grow, the \\ndeterioration of our systems adversely impacts both efficiency and \\nsafety. The U.S. DOT now estimates that we have an $88 billion backlog \\nin the state of good repair of public transportation capital investment \\nneeds. And this backlog doesn\\'t even include the annual cost of \\nmaintaining the current system, like replacing aging buses, rail cars, \\nvans, buildings, bridges and stations; the cost of building new \\ncapacity; and the more than $3 billion in costs to install positive \\ntrain control systems at the nation\\'s commuter railroads.\\n\\n    While spending for public transportation is paid mostly by fares \\nthat riders pay, as well as state and local funding, the federal \\ngovernment is an essential partner in this process. While federal \\nfunding supports 19.2% of all spending on public transportation, 44.4% \\nof all capital spending for transit comes from the federal government. \\nHowever, according to the CBO, the decline in real spending on \\ntransportation infrastructure has occurred at all levels of government, \\nbut it has been the greatest at the federal level. Yet, federal funding \\nis critical as it helps to ensure that locally-derived benefits are \\nfully integrated into the national multimodal transportation network \\nthat is so essential to ensuring U.S. competitiveness in our global \\neconomy.\\n\\n    These are some of the reasons that APTA has urged Congress to enact \\na long-term authorization bill that grows federal funding for public \\ntransportation. We strongly support the preservation of the federal \\ntransit program, and we support an increase in the dedicated revenues \\nthat go into the Highway Trust Fund for both the Mass Transit and \\nHighway Accounts. It is estimated that more than $90 billion in new \\nrevenues is needed just to maintain current public transportation and \\nhighway programs, and APTA strongly believes that there is a need to \\ngrow current federal investment levels for transit. We need a revenue \\nstream that supports growth of the federal programs, as flat funding at \\ncurrent levels will not permit transit to adequately address the \\ngrowing backlog of capital needs or the growing demand for transit \\nservice. It should come as no surprise that we strongly oppose efforts \\nto devolve the federal transit or highway programs tothe states. Public \\ntransportation is an essential part of the overall surface \\ntransportation system, and given our growing population and increasing \\ncongestion on our roadways that program is more important than ever.\\n\\n    We know transit ridership is growing, we know the nation\\'s \\npopulation is expected to grow significantly, and we believe that the \\ndemand for public transportation service in our communities will \\ncontinue to grow. Nationally, public transportation ridership continues \\nto set record levels. In 2014, people took a record 10.8 billion trips \\non public transportation--the highest annual ridership number in 58 \\nyears. Some public transit systems experienced all-time record high \\nridership last year. This record ridership didn\\'t just happen in large \\ncities. It also happened in small and medium size communities. In fact, \\nsome of the biggest gains came in towns with less than 100,000 people \\nwith ridership growth of double the national average. This record \\ngrowth in ridership occurred even when gas prices declined by 42.9 \\ncents in the fourth quarter. From 1995-2014 public transit ridership \\nincreased by 39 percent, almost double the population growth, which was \\n21 percent. The estimated growth of vehicle miles traveled was 25 \\npercent. This proves that once people start riding public transit, they \\ndiscover that there are benefits over and above saving money.\\n\\n    Our failure as a nation to adequately invest in this essential \\nelement of our surface transportation system will only cost the nation \\nmore in the long run. Conversely, investment in public transportation \\nwill help support a healthy, growing economy, facilitating the \\nefficient movement of goods and people, and stimulating economic \\ndevelopment in communities served by vibrant public transportation \\nsystems.\\n\\n    One only needs to ride a train or bus during the morning commute to \\nrecognize the growing demand, and to experience firsthand the strains \\nthat that demand is placing on systems. The demand and support for \\npublic transportation is also reflected at the ballot box. Last year, \\n69 percent of ballot initiatives seeking taxpayer support for transit \\ninvestment were approved by voters. Clearly, citizens are willing to \\npay for improved transit service. These local ballot initiatives \\nconfirm the stability of the local partnership, but they are not a \\nsubstitute for the federal partnership.\\n\\n                    RETURN ON THE FEDERAL INVESTMENT\\n\\n    For every dollar we invest in public transportation, we generate \\nabout $4 in economic returns. And $1 billion in federal transit \\ninvestment fosters productivity gains that create or sustain 50,000 \\njobs. It is important to note that 73% of federal transit capital funds \\nflow through the private sector. In fact, much of the bus and rail \\nequipment is manufactured in rural areas and provides high wage jobs in \\nthose communities. For example, bus original equipment manufacturers \\nhave plants located in Alabama, North Dakota, Kansas, Minnesota, South \\nCarolina, California and upstate New York. Rail Cars are manufactured \\nin places like Nebraska, Idaho, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. Components \\nand subcomponents are being manufactured all across this country. As \\nthese investment metrics make clear, local and regional transportation \\nimprovements yield national benefits.\\n\\n    On a very fundamental level, federal transportation funding keeps \\nthis economic engine running, as transit agencies can only plan and \\nadvance large, multi-year capital projects when they can be confident \\nthe resources will be there when they are ready to break ground.\\n\\n                             APTA PROPOSAL\\n\\n    To ensure the reliable, long-term funding best suited to \\ninfrastructure investment, APTA urges Congress to enact a 6-year, $100 \\nbillion authorization for the federal transit program that includes \\nrobust funding to grow the program from $10.7 billion in the current \\nyear to $22.2 billion in 2021. Revenues into the Highway Trust Fund \\n(HTF) must increase to support this much needed growth.\\n\\n    Additionally, we see this moment in time as an ideal opportunity to \\nestablish a dedicated revenue stream for intercity passenger rail, \\nseparate from the revenues required for the Highway Trust Fund and Mass \\nTransit Account. Like public transit, intercity passenger rail is \\nexperiencing ridership growth and increased demands for public service \\nin corridors throughout the country. We have asked that Congress \\nprovide $50 billion over the next 6 years to facilitate the development \\nof a national high-speed and intercity passenger rail system.\\n\\n    APTA\\'s surface transportation authorization recommendations are \\nbased on needs identified in eight categories of equipment and \\nfacilities funded under the current federal program. They are based on \\nthe need for 6-year investment from all sources--fares, local, state, \\nand federal--of $245 billion. APTA\\'s investment requirements include \\nthe cost of bus replacements, demand response vehicles, rail vehicles, \\nstate-of-good-repair spending, New Starts and core capacity projects, \\nand other costs. And they reflect investment requirements in states, \\ncities and communities across the country.\\n\\n    APTA recommends that Congress take the necessary steps to restore, \\nmaintain and increase the purchasing power of the federal motor fuels \\nuser fee to support a significant increase in the federal investment \\nfor the public transportation program. In addition, in order to meet \\nthe full range of funding needs, APTA supports the use of other \\nfinancing strategies to meet the investment goals.\\n\\n    First and foremost, funding must be sufficient to address the \\ncapital investment needs dictated by the nation\\'s population growth, \\neconomic and personal mobility needs (including the reduction of \\ntraffic congestion), environmental and sustainability needs, and of our \\naging population. While meeting our capital expansion needs, funding \\nmust also be sufficient to address issues of state of good repair \\nacross so many of our aging public transportation systems nationwide.\\n\\n    It is important to note that there are differences between funding \\nand financing when it comes to transportation infrastructure projects. \\nFunding options are those that generate revenue streams and financing \\noptions leverage revenue streams. Financing options are programs or \\ninstruments that leverage revenue streams as a way to move many \\ninfrastructure projects forward, especially significantly large and \\nexpensive projects. Without adequate funding sources, states and local \\ngovernments cannot take full advantage of the financing tools \\navailable. Additionally, financing options may not be practical or \\navailable for every infrastructure project.\\n\\n    Unfortunately, current revenues going into the Highway Trust Fund \\nare $15-16 billion short of what is needed annually just to fund \\ncurrent transit and highway programs. Since the expiration of the \\nSAFETEA-LU authorizing law in 2009, federal funding has grown by less \\nthan one-half percent while demand for transit service has grown and \\nthe cost of restoring the existing systems to a state of good repair \\nhas grown to $88 billion.\\n\\n    Second, it is imperative that the funding for transportation \\ninvestment be stable and reliable, whether they be from federal, state, \\nor local sources, or from public transportation-generated revenues or \\npublic-private partnerships. Major transit capital investments often \\nrequire advance planning and multi-year construction programs.\\n\\n    Third, it is critical that the transportation finance legislation \\ndeveloped by this Committee recognize that not all financing mechanisms \\nand revenue generators work at the same level of efficiency and \\neffectiveness for all modes. Our proposal recommends legislation that \\nwould promote the development of revenue generated from traditional \\nfinancing sources like municipal bonds to innovative financing \\nmechanisms, such as public private partnerships, tolling and congestion \\npricing to supplement current revenue streams. However, infrastructure \\nbanks, municipal bonds, private activity bonds, and loan programs such \\nas Transportation Infrastructure and Finance Act program (TIFIA) and \\nthe Railroad Innovation and Improvement Financing Program (RRIIF) that \\nrequire payback will not sustain an ongoing transit program. They can \\nhelp public-private partnerships work, but transit public-private \\npartnerships are not a revenue source but rather a management tool.\\n\\n    We want to emphasize that the certainty and predictability of the \\ndedicated funding within the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust \\nFund, and channeled through the Federal Transit Program, has truly \\nserved the needs of the public transportation industry, and allowed \\nagency finance professionals to take advantage of and leverage a \\nmultitude of financing arrangements.\\n\\n    For many years the federal gas tax has supported the national \\nprogram and served effectively as a user fee. While trends and market \\nforces suggest that the gas tax is not the growing revenue source that \\nit once was, it remains a viable source that can be collected \\nefficiently and without creating any new federal bureaucracy in the \\nshort run. The most sustainable, forward-looking and outcome-\\noriented approach may be a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) fee, but \\nbecause the systems, methods and infrastructure to implement such a \\nnational system are years away, the augmented gas tax could be the \\nbridge to an ongoing national VMT fee. While APTA has put forward these \\nideas on how to raise revenues for the Highway Trust Fund, we are open \\nto any mechanism that provides a predictable source of funding for \\nthese important investments.\\n\\n                               CONCLUSION\\n\\n    Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I thank you for this \\nopportunity to share our views as you move forward on this next \\nauthorization of surface transportation programs and urge the Committee \\nto support the Federal Transit Program with a 6-year investment level \\nfor transit projects of at least $100 billion. The next program will \\nabsolutely require a wide range of funding options, but for the \\nimmediate future, we feel strongly that the base program must restore \\nand increase the purchasing power of the Federal Motor Fuels User Tax \\nwhile we concurrently move with a true sense of urgency to develop and \\nimplement a national transportation future funding model that is both \\neconomically and environmentally sustainable. We need to have funding \\npredictability, both for our agencies and our private sector partners.\\n\\n    Thank you for allowing us to provide testimony on these critical \\nissues. We look forward to working with you and the members of the \\nCommittee as you work to develop this next critical authorization bill.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n               American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)\\n\\n                      101 Constitution Ave., N.W.\\n\\n                             Suite 373 East\\n\\n                         Washington, D.C. 20001\\n\\n                         Phone: (202) 789-7850\\n\\n                          Fax: (202) 789-7859\\n\\n                              www.asce.org\\n\\n                        Statement for the Record\\n\\n                                   On\\n\\n               ``Dead End, No Turn Around, Danger Ahead: \\n             Challenges to the Future of Highway Funding\\'\\'\\n\\n                          United States Senate\\n\\n                          Committee on Finance\\n\\n                             June 18, 2015\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) \\\\1\\\\ commends the Senate \\nFinance Committee for holding this hearing on the importance of \\ntransportation infrastructure as a priority and the urgency surrounding \\nthe need to fix the Federal Highway Trust Fund (HTF) and enact a multi-\\nyear, robust surface transportation authorization bill. The current \\nsurface transportation law, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st \\nCentury Act (MAP-21), expired on September 30, 2014 and the program is \\nnow operating under a second temporary extension which expires on July \\n31, 2015. Due to the limited funds available in the HTF, any program \\nauthorization beyond July must be accompanied with additional revenue \\nfor the fund. ASCE believes that a more permanent, long-term fix for \\nthe HTF is in order--one that provides dedicated, sustainable revenue \\nthat can grow the program and not add to the nation\\'s deficit.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ ASCE was founded in 1852 and is the country\\'s oldest national \\ncivil engineering organization. It represents more than 146,000 civil \\nengineers individually in private practice, government, industry, and \\nacademia who are dedicated to the advancement of the science and \\nprofession of civil engineering. ASCE is a non-profit educational and \\nprofessional society organized under Part 1.501(c)(3) of the Internal \\nRevenue Code. www.asce.org.\\n\\nMulti-month program extensions hurt the ability of states and local \\nagencies to shape long-term transportation plans and deliver large \\nmulti-year projects. Extensions and funding patches also create \\ninstability for designers and builders who cannot properly anticipate \\ntheir contracting schedules or hiring needs. In 2015, Arkansas, \\nGeorgia, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming have indicated that federal \\nuncertainty is affecting their ability to deliver projects on their \\nstate priority list. Congress should act by July 31, 2015 to secure a \\nlong-term funding solution. Hopefully today\\'s hearing will further \\nunderscore this need to act and highlight what the impact of federal \\ninaction truly means to users of the system.\\nAn Aging Infrastructure System\\nOur infrastructure is the foundation on which the national economy \\ndepends, yet it is taken for granted by most Americans. While the \\nInterstate Highway System is a shining example of a focused national \\nvision for the state\\'s infrastructure, an expanding population and a \\ngrowing economy requires these aging infrastructure systems to keep \\npace. Deteriorating and aging infrastructure is not only an \\ninconvenience, it financially impacts our families, local communities, \\nand our National economy.\\n\\nWhile revenue for the HTF continues to fall short of authorized \\nspending levels, the current lack of infrastructure investment has also \\nweakened our state\\'s surface transportation system with a documented \\nloss to the economy. Our inability to keep our infrastructure efficient \\nundermines the U.S. competitiveness and economic strength.\\n\\nASCE\\'s 2013 Report Card for America\\'s Infrastructure \\\\2\\\\ graded the \\nstate\\'s infrastructure a ``D+\\'\\' based on 16 categories and found that \\nthe state needs to invest approximately $3.6 trillion by 2020 to \\nmaintain the national infrastructure in good condition. The $3.6 \\ntrillion figure is the total needs funding amount across all \\ninfrastructure sectors, with federal, state and local transportation \\nshortfall being $1.7 trillion. The following are the grades and the \\ninvestment needs by 2020 for the surface transportation area:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\2\\\\ www.infrastructurereportcard.org.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  \\x01  Bridges received a grade of C+;\\n\\n  \\x01  Transit received a D; and\\n\\n  \\x01  Roads received a grade of D.\\n\\nEstablishing a sound financial foundation for future surface \\ntransportation preservation and improvement must be an essential part \\nof a reauthorization package. The current spending of $91 billion per \\nyear, from all levels of government, for highway capital improvements \\nis well below the estimated $170 billion needed annually to improve \\nconditions.\\n\\nThe Federal Transit Administration (FTA) estimates a maintenance \\nbacklog of nearly $78 billion needed to bring all transit systems up to \\na state of good repair. With funding as the cornerstone of any attempt \\nto authorize the state\\'s surface transportation programs, it is \\nimperative that a variety of funding issues be advanced as part of an \\noverall strategy.\\nThe Cost of Inaction\\nIn an effort to demonstrate the importance of infrastructure investment \\nto the state\\'s economy, ASCE released a series of economic studies that \\naimed to answer a critical question: What does a ``D+\\'\\' infrastructure \\ngrade mean for America\\'s economy and what is the return on investment \\nwe can expect to see with increased funding? In 2011, ASCE released a \\nstudy that measured the potential impacts to the economy in 2020 and \\n2040 if the nation merely maintained current levels of surface \\ntransportation investments. It is important to note that should \\nCongress produce a multi-year authorization bill that fails to increase \\nfunding levels, the year 2020 economic impact results of this study \\nwill become reality.\\n\\nThe study, Failure to Act: the Economic Impact of Current Investment \\nTrends in Surface Transportation Infrastructure,\\\\3\\\\ found that if \\ninvestments in surface transportation are not made, families will have \\na lower standard of living, businesses will be paying more and \\nproducing less, and our state will lose ground in a global economy. The \\nstate\\'s deteriorating surface transportation system will cost the \\nAmerican economy more than 876,000 jobs in 2020, and suppress the \\ngrowth of the country\\'s GDP by $897 billion by 2020 and ultimately, \\nAmericans will also get paid less. While the economy will lose jobs \\noverall, those who are able to find work will find their paychecks cut \\nbecause of the ripple effects that will occur through the economy.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ www.asce.org/failuretoact.\\n\\n [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]    \\n\\nFailure to Act also shows that failing infrastructure will drive the \\ncost of doing business up by adding $430 billion to transportation \\ncosts by 2020. Firms will spend more to ship goods, and the raw \\nmaterials they buy will cost more due to increased transportation \\ncosts. Productivity costs will also fall, with businesses \\nunderperforming by $240 billion by 2020; this in turn will drive up the \\ncosts of goods. As a result, U.S. exports will fall by $28 billion, \\nincluding 79 of 93 tradable commodities. Ten sectors of the U.S. \\neconomy account for more than half of this unprecedented loss in export \\nvalue--among them key manufacturing sectors like machinery, medical \\ndevices, and communications equipment. As a contrast, most of America\\'s \\nmajor economic competitors in Europe and Asia have already invested in \\nand are reaping the benefits of improved competitiveness from their \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ninfrastructure systems.\\n\\nTherefore, by improving the state\\'s deteriorating surface \\ntransportation infrastructure systems both economic and job creation \\nopportunities will be enhanced.\\nA Federal Responsibility\\nAfter General George Washington and his troops defeated the British in \\n1783, the nation was faced with a dilemma: The current governing \\ndocument, the Articles of Confederation was not equipped to outline the \\nrules that would govern the new United States. In order to better \\nprovide for the general welfare of the country by fostering trade, \\ncommerce and goods movement, the founding fathers made a strong \\ncommitment that there was to be a clear federal role in infrastructure \\ndevelopment and transportation mobility. They underscored this, in \\npart, by adding to Article 1, Section 8 the language that, ``The \\nCongress shall have power . . . to . . . establish . . . post roads.\\'\\'\\n\\nIn addition to the historical and constitutional context, there remains \\na practical reality to continued support for the federal surface \\ntransportation programs. Imagine what would happen if the federal \\ngovernment were to relinquish its responsibility in the blink of an \\neye. That action would represent one of the single largest unfunded \\nmandates--nearly $50 billion a year that the federal government has \\never placed on states and localities. This would seem to go against the \\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act passed in 1995 that aimed to curb the \\npractice of imposing unfunded federal mandates on states and local \\ngovernments.\\n\\nAbsent a federal partner the National Highway System would still need \\nto be preserved; roads, bridges and new transit systems built. Every \\nstate would have to work quickly to enact, on average, an immediate 24 \\ncent per gallon gasoline tax increase or else risk having their entire \\ntransportation network fall further into disrepair. ASCE strongly \\nopposes efforts to devolve the federal surface transportation program. \\nThat\\'s an unnecessary risk that our economy, the public, and States and \\nlocalities should not have to entertain. A robust, multi-year surface \\ntransportation bill is necessary to improve the system and deliver \\nprojects that require budget certainty.\\nNeed for Robust, Long-Term Funding\\nSince the creation of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, the HTF \\nhas been supported by revenue collected from road users. This ``pay-as-\\nyou-go\\'\\' system has served the nation well over the past half a \\ncentury, allowing states to plan, construct, and improve the surface \\ntransportation network. Additionally, the reliable stream of user-\\nsupplied revenue has been critical to the legislative process, because \\nit has enabled Congress to guarantee the availability of multi-year \\nfunding to states.\\n\\nThe federal gas tax was last changed in 1993--over 20 years, creating a \\nrevenue shortfall in the HTF that increases each year. Currently, the \\nHTF is allocating more than the revenues it receives, with the trust \\nfund allocating $15 billion more than raised in 2014 alone. The \\nCongressional Budget Office recently projected that the 6-year \\ncumulative gap in the HTF will grow to approximately $90 billion by \\n2020.\\n\\nThe traditional basis of HTF funding, motor fuel user fees, have not \\nbeen raised since 1993, yet every year demands on the system grow and \\nthe purchasing power of those 1993-dollars further degrades. As a \\nresult, current levels of highway and transit investment cannot be \\nmaintained solely with HTF resources. Over the last 6 years, Congress \\nhas had to dedicate approximately $60 billion from general fund \\nrevenues to shore-up the HTF. When the choices are either to cut \\nfunding, raid the general fund, or raise additional revenue, there are \\nno easy options. It\\'s time for Congress to lead the way on a solution \\nto fix the HTF.\\n\\nASCE supports a reliable, long-term, sustained user fee approach to \\nbuilding, maintaining and improving the state\\'s highways and transit \\nsystems and believes that all funding and financing options should be \\nconsidered by Congress. We recently endorsed House legislation that \\nwould raise the federal fuels tax by 15 cents per gallon over the \\ncourse of a 3 year period. In recent years the Simpson-Bowles \\nCommission \\\\4\\\\ and the National Surface Transportation Infrastructure \\nFinancing Commission,\\\\5\\\\ among others, have come to the conclusion that \\nadditional user-based revenue is needed, with each suggesting an \\nincrease in the federal motor fuels tax. While the motor fuels tax \\nremains the best long-term solution to solving the HTF shortfall in a \\nfiscally responsible, deficit neutral way, a full range of options must \\nbe considered within the context of reauthorization, either within or \\noutside of any broader tax reform package.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\4\\\\ http://momentoftruthproject.org/report/recommendations.\\n    \\\\5\\\\ http://financecommission.dot.gov/.\\n\\nIt is important to fix the inability of the fuels tax rate to maintain \\nits purchasing strength because it is not indexed to economic \\nindicators like the Consumer Price Index (CPI). An indexing of this \\nsort is done with other government revenues and would allow the gas tax \\nto remain strong despite the rising costs of steel, other building \\nmaterials and worker pay. If adjusted to the projected CPI over the \\nnext 10 years, the current fuels tax would raise \\\\6\\\\ an additional \\n$27.5 billion, which is enough to plug the HTF shortfall for about 2 \\nyears. ASCE recommends raising the motor fuels tax by 25 cents per \\ngallon and indexing for inflation to help meet our state\\'s near-term \\nsurface transportation needs.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\6\\\\ http://renacci.house.gov/index.cfm/2015/4/bipartisan-group-of-\\nlawmakers-introduce-long-term-solution-to-address-highway-trust-fund\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFacilitating Access to Private Capital\\nInnovative financing tools can greatly accelerate infrastructure \\ndevelopment and can have a powerful economic stimulus effect compared \\nto conventional methods, but need to be coupled with approaches that \\nprovide dedicated funding to the HTF. It should be noted, however, that \\ninnovative financing should not be viewed as an alternative to funding. \\nIn fact, many times P3s are dependent upon securing public support on \\nuser fees like tolling.\\n\\nASCE supports innovative financing programs and the use of public-\\nprivate partnerships (P3s) and advocates making programs available to \\nall states and localities. Additionally, the federal government should \\nmake every effort assist public asset owners to engage in P3s and also \\nfacilitate engagement with private investors who are oftentimes in \\nsearch of clear, accurate asset and project data that can help inform \\ntheir infrastructure investment strategies.\\n\\nPrograms like Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act \\n(TIFIA), bonds, national and state infrastructure banks, and other \\ninnovative solutions like the President\\'s Qualified Public \\nInfrastructure Bonds (QPIBS) are attractive products to both the public \\nand private sector to fill the state\\'s infrastructure investment gap. \\nIn this sense, it would be helpful to see an even greater engagement by \\nthe private sector in the funding debate, and the need for additional \\npublic sector revenues, in order to make the most out of private \\nfinancing opportunities.\\nNext Steps: Long-Term Revenue Mechanism\\nASCE supports the need to address the issue of future sources of \\nrevenue for surface transportation funding. Congress should allow for \\nthe exploration of the feasibility of the most promising funding \\noptions that will ensure the long-term viability of the HTF. In \\nparticular, a mileage-based system for funding our state\\'s surface \\ntransportation systems needs further study, and the recommendation of \\nthe National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing \\nCommission\\\\7\\\\ calling for a transition to a mileage-based user fee \\nsystem must be considered. A federal effort to support further state \\nand local pilot testing of these options, as a follow-up to the ongoing \\nwork being conducted in Oregon, should be supported. This \\nexperimentation at the state and community level will be critical in \\ndetermining how to generate future HTF revenue as the state\\'s \\ndependence on gasoline as a fuel source for automobiles is reduced.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\7\\\\ http://financecommission.dot.gov/\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nConclusion\\nSurface transportation infrastructure is the critical engine supporting \\nthe nation\\'s economy, national security, and public safety. To compete \\nin the global economy, improve our quality of life and raise our \\nstandard of living, we must successfully rebuild America\\'s surface \\ntransportation infrastructure for the 21st century. Faced with that \\ntask, Congress must continue to fund surface transportation projects \\nand should approve a long-term, sustainable HTF revenue solution to \\ncomplement MAP-21 policy reforms before the law expires on July 31, \\n2015. This long overdue combination would maximize the ability of \\nfederal resources to build and maintain a national surface \\ntransportation network that boosts economic competitiveness and job \\ncreation.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n                          State of California\\n\\n                              edmund g. brown jr., governor\\n\\nLUCETTA DUNN, CHAIR\\n\\nBOB ALVARADO, VICE CHAIR\\n\\nSENATOR JIM BEALL, EX OFFICIO\\n\\nASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM FRAZIER, EX OFFICIO\\n\\nWILL KEMPTON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\\n\\n                  CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION\\n\\n                          1120 N STREET, MS-52\\n\\n                          SACRAMENTO, CA 95814\\n\\n                            P.O.

Federal funding for \\ntransportation is a crucial component in the process of maintaining our \\nmobility and ensuring a robust national economy. As a result, \\nCongressional consideration of the future of transportation funding is \\ncritical.\\n\\nInvestments to preserve our transportation system have not kept pace \\nwith demand, and the current method of funding the Highway Trust Fund \\nthrough excise taxes is no longer keeping up with the cost of \\nmaintaining, operating, and expanding the nation\\'s vast transportation \\nnetwork. In real terms, funding has diminished while the demand and the \\ncost to maintain and operate the transportation system have soared. To \\neffectively address this pending transportation funding crisis, \\nimmediate and long-range sustainable solutions are required. A solution \\nshould be implemented in the near-term to stabilize transportation \\nfunding while a long-term mechanism is secured.\\n\\nExcise taxes are paid based on fuel consumption, not direct usage of \\nthe transportation system. As fuel consumption continues to decline due \\nto improved and more fuel-efficient vehicles, and as consumers turn to \\nalternative fueled vehicles; the relationship between fuel consumption \\nand costs imposed on the transportation system will continue to \\ndeteriorate. A road usage charge, also known as a mileage based user \\nfee or a vehicle miles traveled fee, refers to a fee based on the \\nnumber of miles a vehicle travels over a given time period. A road \\ncharge is considered to be a more effective option for funding \\ntransportationinfrastructure than excise taxes since it directly \\ncharges users prices that reflect the full cost of the transportation \\nservices provided.\\n\\nAlong with several other states, California is taking an aggressive \\nstance to address this chronic transportation funding shortfall by \\ninvestigating the potential of a pay as-you-go road charge in-lieu of \\nthe traditional fuel-based excise tax. In 2014, California legislation \\nwas enacted to establish a Road Charge Technical Advisory Committee to \\ndesign a road charge demonstration program in our state. Development \\nand implementation of a road charge pilot program requires a \\ncollaborative development and deployment process to address privacy, \\ntechnology, administrative and other public concerns while ensuring the \\nultimate success of a new funding mechanism.\\n\\nWe strongly support efforts to develop a bipartisan plan to stabilize \\nand enhance the Highway Trust Fund\\'s current revenue stream this year \\nand in subsequent years.

Hatch\\nChairman\\nCommittee on Finance\\nU.S. Senate\\nWashington, D.C.\\n\\nRe: Hearing June 18, 2015, Dead End, No Turn Around, Danger Ahead: \\nChallenges to the Future of Highway Funding\\n\\nDear Chairman Hatch and Members of the Committee on Finance:\\n\\nI write on behalf of the Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute, one of \\nour nation\\'s oldest technical institutes and a Standards Developing \\nOrganization (SDO). The CRSI is recognized as the authoritative \\nresource for steel reinforced concrete construction. Members include \\nsome of the country\\'s largest steel mills, fabricators, material \\nsuppliers and placers of steel reinforcing bars and related products. \\nOur Professional members are involved in the research, design, and \\nconstruction of structures and pavements. Together, they form the \\nbackbone of the steel reinforced concrete industry spanning our Nation \\nthat relies heavily on surface transportation.\\n\\nAs Chairman of CRSI, I am responsible for the well being of the \\nInstitute, and to keep apprised of public policy impacts to our \\nindustry. Lack of a long-term transportation authorization at \\nsufficient levels of funding impacts not only our industry, but also \\nevery business that relies on a well built and maintained \\ntransportation system, and disadvantages the country as a whole. As \\nmembers of Congress, you have the responsibility of providing Federal \\nfunding for our Nation\\'s surface transportation system.\\n\\nWe believe that the solution to funding is to maintain a user-fee-based \\nHighway Trust Fund with increased levels of investment. We thank you \\nfor your attention and urge Congress to pass legislation on this model \\nthis year.\\n\\nFinance and support for our surface transportation systems is based on \\na per-gallon tax unchanged since 1993. Few of us in the private sector \\nare operating with 22 year old systems or funding mechanisms. No \\nAmerican business or a state Department of Transportation is working \\nwith the same W-2 numbers from 1993; no business small or large is \\nusing the same trucks or machinery from 22 years ago. Our organization \\nand practically every interest from the National Association of \\nManufacturers to the AFL-CIO recognize the need for an increase in \\ninfrastructure investment, and we are willing to pay for an increase in \\nthe Federal gas fee. We know that you recognize that a safe, efficient \\nsystem of transport and transit is essential to our economic strength. \\nTools, personnel and equipment used to make and deliver products \\nrequire periodic investment--highways and transit are no different.\\n\\nThe user fee assessed at the pump is paid by those who use fuel in \\nproportion to that use. It is a sensible system. Granted, with the \\nimprovement in fuel efficiency and other contemporary developments, \\nCongress will in the future need to address other funding mechanisms to \\nmeet our infrastructure spending needs. For now we believe the current \\nsystem is fair and functional.\\n\\nMany states have raised their fuel fees because they recognize their \\nresidents and industries are willing to support a higher level of \\ninvestment. Leaders in these states have demonstrated they know that a \\nvibrant economy requires investment. This has been the tradition of our \\nFederal transportation program since it\\'s founding--citizens willing to \\npay.\\n\\nWe have patched, extended, delayed and dallied for far too many months. \\nThe country needs a serious, 6-year highway authorization bill with \\nfunding beyond the clearly inadequate current levels. We need a \\nsustainable funding stream, not obscure ``pay-fors\\'\\' to offset spending \\nor to take revenue from the General Treasury. Highways, transit and \\nbridges take years to plan and build. We cannot do the work with short-\\nterm funding band-aids. Congress should not think that status quo is \\ngood enough; it\\'s not.\\n\\nWe urge you to invest in and restore the infrastructure superiority of \\nthe United States. Delay will only be more costly and detrimental.\\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n\\nScott D. Stevens, PE\\nChairman of the Board\\nConcrete Reinforcing Steel Institute\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n             Statement Submitted for the Record by Dean Fry\\nDead End, No Turn Around, Danger Ahead: Challenges to the Future of \\nHighway Funding\\nUnited States Senate Committee on Finance\\nThursday, June 18, 2015, 10:00 AM\\n215 Dirksen Senate Office Building\\n\\nDean Fry\\n10727 Saint Matthew Lane\\nSaint Ann, MO 63074\\n\\n    The following is an exploration of some possible ways to fund \\ntransportation facilities, with my recommendations for federal funding \\nat the end. Some of these should be considered extreme and undesirable, \\nbut are included here for illustration. Many may suit one jurisdiction \\nwell while be unadvisable to others. For the purposes of this article, \\nTransportation District refers to any private, local, city, county, or \\nstate organizations with authority to build and maintain \\ntransportation. The advantages and disadvantages are intended to be \\nillustrative and not exhaustive.\\n\\n    \\x01  Property owners responsible for maintaining the right of way \\nbordering their property.\\n\\nAdvantages: Property owners pay no taxes to the government for the \\nupkeep and construction of transportation facilities but do pay for \\nothers to do the work or does the work themselves, no restrictions on \\nthe types of transportation, tends to reduce urban sprawl. \\nDisadvantages: No economy of scale, undue burden on corner and other \\nlong frontage properties, pressure to allow property owners to toll the \\nportion they are responsible for, possible differing standards and \\nstates of repair, no public mass transit, no public higher speed \\nfacilities, resistance to spending for heavier and higher capacity \\nfacilities especially in residential areas, limited freight movement. \\nGovernment enforcement of minimum maintenance likely to be required and \\nfacilities are likely to deteriorate rapidly in hard times. \\nRecommendation: Should not be used; while the apparent savings of taxes \\nlooks attractive, it is very possible more tax money, from a different \\ntax, would be required to provide enforcement of the maintenance \\nstandards, not to mention the property owner is likely paying more for \\nroad work due to lack of economy of scale. Once neighbors agree to work \\ntogether to keep the roads and how to pay for it, they have created \\nsomething equivalent to a tax structure.\\n\\n    \\x01 Neighborhood Associations.\\n\\nAdvantages: Property owners pay no taxes to the government for the \\nupkeep and construction of transportation facilities but do pay an \\nassociation fee as agreed and/or perform the work themselves, no \\nrestrictions on the types of transportation, tends to reduce urban \\nsprawl, better economy of scale, maintenance likely to be better, may \\nsupport on-demand transit with association owned vehicle. \\nDisadvantages: Pressure to allow associations to toll the roadways for \\nwhich they are responsible, possible differing standards and states of \\nrepair, facilities may deteriorate rapidly in hard times, no public \\nhigher speed facilities, resistance to spending for heavier and higher \\ncapacity facilities especially in residential areas, likely limited \\nfreight movement, may be poor connections between associations. \\nRecommendation: Could work very well for some residential \\nneighborhoods, which would strengthen them; could work well within a \\ncommercial district with businesses of similar market reach. The \\nbusinesses may want to partially provide the higher capacity travelways \\nthrough the neighboring residential neighborhoods. Combining \\nassociations into cooperative districts could reduce some of the \\ndisadvantages and improve the advantages, funding for the cooperative \\ndistrict would come from the associations, not directly from the \\npeople.\\n\\n    \\x01  Monthly Access (Utility) Fees (similar to those used by \\ncommunications companies).\\n\\nAdvantages: Economy of scale, use for emergency services and for \\nnonemergency medical transportation possible, burden to long frontage \\nproperties reduced, consistency of function and repair is better, does \\nnot treat one person as worth more than another, funds transportation \\nmore like a utility, which it is. Disadvantages: May be focused on \\naccess to the detriment of mobility, depending on the size of the \\ntransportation district, may be perceived as falling heavily on small \\nproperties and the poor, connections between transportation districts \\nmay be poor, may allow urban sprawl. Recommendation: Should not be used \\nas a standalone funding system. Could be used to fund up to two lanes \\nfor each roadway, walkways, bikeways, and possibly, a fareless local \\nbus like system with stops a reasonable walking distance from every \\naddress. If adopted, vehicle registration fees should be rescinded, and \\nproperty taxes for roadways and services should be reduced accordingly.\\n\\n    \\x01 Tolls and Fares.\\n\\nAdvantages: Users pay the cost of the systems, does not treat one \\nperson as more important than another, provides for robust limited \\naccess transportation, tends to reduce urban sprawl. Disadvantages: \\nDifficult to apply to walkways, places with numerous access points, and \\nresidential neighborhoods; may be perceived as falling-more heavily on \\nthe poor; connections to other transportation districts could be choke \\npoints; traffic on some portions may be insufficient to toll or fare at \\na reasonable rate. Recommendation: Should not be used as a standalone \\nfunding system. Works best if all limited access type systems are \\ntolled or fared.\\n\\n    \\x01 Property taxes (traditional method for funding local roadways).\\n\\nAdvantages: The collection of property taxes is well understood, \\ndistributes the tax burden fairly evenly based on property values, good \\ntransportation systems tend to increase property values. Disadvantages: \\nProperty values can experience significant fluctuations, making \\nforecasting the revenue less predictable than other taxes, poor people \\nmay own relatively high value properties and rich people may own \\nrelatively low value properties, does not account for traffic \\ngeneration. Recommendation: Should continue to move away from using \\nthis tax in a standalone system. A property tax with limitations is \\nstill a viable method of funding transportation. In good years, a \\npercentage of the increase in property tax revenue from 1 year to the \\nnext, due to valuation increases, could be set aside for transportation \\nexpansion to encourage continued growth and soften some downturns.\\n\\n    \\x01 Fuel Excise Tax (used primarily to fund higher mobility \\nroadways).\\n\\nAdvantages: Well understood taxing system, user tax, can be used to \\ndiscourage use of carbon based fuels. Disadvantages: Does not account \\nfor weight or gas mileage of the vehicle, not a true user tax; not \\neasily justifiable for non-roadway use even when drivers are \\nbenefitted, induces urban sprawl, greenhouse concerns, some needed \\nroads cannot be maintained based on traffic counts for that road. The \\nhistory of this tax provides a lesson on how a seemingly progressive \\ntax can become regressive. Recommendation: Excise taxes still have some \\nvalue for funding transportation, but should be depended on less and \\nless moving into the future. Nevertheless, since the trucking industry \\nalready supports a tax increase, the diesel tax could be immediately \\nraised to an amount the trucking industry is agreeable to.\\n\\n    \\x01 Vehicle Miles Traveled Fee (could be used for all roadways).\\n\\nAdvantages: Truer user fee that can account for the weight of the \\nvehicle, can be discounted for older vehicle that the poorer are more \\nlikely to drive, applies evenly to alternately fueled vehicles, can be \\ntracked by GPS, odometer reading at registration, or other method if \\navailable, can make use of the fuel tax or regular estimated billing to \\navoid yearly lump sum payments. Disadvantages: Privacy concerns with \\ntracking, not easily justifiable for non-roadway use even when drivers \\nare benefitted, may induce urban sprawl, may be political pressure to \\nmatch the funding with the portion of roadway related to its \\ncollection, some needed roads cannot be maintained based on traffic \\ncounts for that road. Recommendation: Should not be used as a \\nstandalone funding system. The VMT fee is a more accurate and fair \\nsystem than the Fuel Excise Tax and could be implemented as soon as \\nprivacy issues can be resolved. However, many commercial vehicles \\nalready carry GPS systems and the privacy concerns are less. The \\ndevelopment of VMT fees for commercial vehicles should fast track, with \\nthe lessons learned then being applied as VMT fees for private vehicles \\ndevelop.\\n\\n    \\x01 Commuter Miles Tax (Based on distance from primary home to work \\nlocation).\\n\\nAdvantages: User tax, may be used for any type of transportation, fits \\neasily with improving congestion and bottlenecks, uses well understood \\npayroll deduction to assess, can be limited to a maximum amount for \\nlower tax brackets, can be indexed at higher rates for greater miles to \\nlocations within defined urban areas, may reduce sprawl, can be used in \\ncombination with a Fuel Excise Tax decrease, revenues increase as the \\nnumber of jobs increase. Disadvantages: Little known concept with \\nunknown resistance, payroll deduction may make the tax more noticeable \\neven though not greater, would likely not provide adequate funding for \\nmany rural roads. Recommendation: Should not be used as a standalone \\ntax; should be phased in until the amount collected is consistent with \\nand covers the number of commuter miles traveled while the Fuel Excise \\nTax is reduced accordingly.\\n\\n    \\x01  Commercial Income Tax (Transportation is necessary for business \\nto do business).\\n\\nAdvantages: May be used for any type of transportation and can better \\nprovide for freight. Corporate Taxes are well understood. It is within \\nthe interests of the business community to draw people to their \\nbusinesses and to reduce the costs of goods and services, which good \\ntransportation does. The tax could be considered more as an investment \\nrather than a tax if done right. Disadvantages: Conflicting interests \\nmay affect project priority, especially when funding is down. \\nRecommendation: Set aside a percentage of corporate income taxes for \\ntransportation use in keeping with the desire to grow the economy.\\n\\n    \\x01 Repatriation.\\n\\nAdvantages: Provides a large one-time source of funds with relatively \\nlittle pain due to the current large amounts of money parked overseas. \\nAt a more normal level, repatriation could provide a steady source of \\nfunding for ports, airports, and border crossings, and their associated \\nfacilities. Recommendation: Use the large one-time funds to repair, \\nrehabilitate, rebuild, and expand as necessary all bridges and tunnels, \\nroad or railroad, that cross state lines, and then to do the same with \\nbridges of tunnels of longer than 2,000 feet regardless of location. \\nThe remainder of this funding could then be used to make mass transit \\nmore competitive against automobile traffic, ideally, with automated \\nvehicle-on-demand transit. Use the normal flow of repatriated funds to \\nprovide infrastructure and support for international trade.\\n\\n    The first five of these funding methods should not be used at the \\nfederal level, but there should be no law or regulation at the federal \\nlevel to restrict or inhibit the used of these funding options at the \\nlocal level.\\n\\n    According to the best figures I could find, commuter travel is \\nabout a third of all miles traveled. A rate of $0.01 per mile will \\ngenerate about $10 billion per year and would be about $1.60 per week \\nfor the average commuter. Transportation studies would require \\nobtaining the most effective mix of transportation forms to fund for \\nconstruction and operation.\\n\\n    The commercial and industrial community should be challenged \\nthrough the Chamber of Commerce and other such organizations to \\nconsider how they would pay for transportation systems, like they were \\nmaking an investment to improve their bottom line. They should be \\nchallenged to propose self-taxing funding options and amounts in such a \\nway as to be reasonably fair to all the businesses, and that can be \\nessentially rubber-stamped by Congress. They should be challenged with \\nhow to improve highways, waterways, railways, airways, and all their \\nassociated infrastructure and interconnections.\\n\\n    Final recommendations for federal level transportation funding:\\n\\n  \\x01 Change and combine the differing trust funds to a Transportation \\n        Trust Fund, and require the best option for a transportation \\n        project among types as well as location and size for the \\n        preferred alternative.\\n\\n  \\x01 Over a 6 year period, phase in a commuter distance tax to a rate of \\n        $0.03 per mile, limited to a fixed amount per year for lower \\n        income people; phase in a commercial vehicle miles traveled tax \\n        at rates consistent with the weight of the vehicle; phase out \\n        the fuel excise tax; and phase out or reduce fares on mass \\n        transit systems, depending on amenities. Do not impose a VMT on \\n        personal vehicles. Also, increase the commuter distance tax \\n        rate for those who commute more than 20 miles and 30 miles to \\n        $0.035 and $0.04 respectively. Since a tax deduction is allowed \\n        for personal vehicles used for business, the regulations can be \\n        changed to allow the IRS to subtract the commercial vehicle \\n        miles traveled tax from the normal deduction and place that \\n        amount in the trust fund. These changes will keep the present \\n        total collections about the same while providing future growth \\n        as the number of jobs increases. It will also be a more \\n        progressive tax structure. These taxes are more sustainable \\n        that what is done now and fit well with the types-of-projects \\n        funded with federal dollars.\\n\\n  \\x01 Challenge business and industry to find $20 billion in ``self-\\n        taxing\\'\\' to add to the trust fund at the federal level, and \\n        phasing that up to $50 billion over 6 years. The regulations \\n        should allow this funding to continue to grow as the economy \\n        grows.\\n\\n  \\x01 Use repatriation to fund certain ``mega projects\\'\\' that will not be \\n        done without a very large source of funding. Reduce the \\n        overseas tax rate to something more reasonable so the money \\n        parked overseas comes back in a reasonable amount of time. \\n        Discount that rate by 5% to bring funds back more quickly for a \\n        short length of time. Let the tax be voluntary, but if it is to \\n        be more than a 5% discount, then it should be mandatory. In the \\n        future, use all the repatriation funding for infrastructure and \\n        services that support international trade.\\n\\nAll of these taxes are sustainable because they are used to build up \\nthe base from which they come, unlike the fuel excise tax.\\n\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n                  Great Lakes Metro Chambers Coalition\\n\\nJune 16, 2015\\n\\nThe Honorable Orrin G. Hatch\\nChairman\\nCommittee on Finance\\n219 Dirksen Senate Office Building\\nWashington, DC 20510\\n\\nDear Chairman Hatch:\\n\\nThe following statement of Ed Wolking, Jr., Executive Director, Great \\nLakes Metro Chambers Coalition is provided for the record of the \\nCommittee\\'s June 18, 2015 hearing on long-term financing of the Highway \\nTrust Fund. I am also the Executive Vice President, Detroit Regional \\nChamber, One Woodward Avenue, Suite 1900, Detroit, MI 48226.\\n\\nTransportation infrastructure is critically important to a thriving \\nGreat Lakes regional economy. Modern, effective, multi-modal, \\nintegrated transportation infrastructure systems create good jobs, \\nsupport the unique needs of inland metropolitan regions, and facilitate \\ninternational trade and exports. They are the platform for the highly \\nintegrated regional supply chains which have made the Great Lakes and \\nMidwest one of the world\\'s top manufacturing centers. The critical \\nconnector in our supply chain systems--what gives them their great \\nflexibility and adaptability--is our highway and bridge systems. Their \\ncontinued maintenance and development are essential to the performance \\nof our regional and national economy.\\n\\nThe future of Great Lakes manufacturing depends on resolving the long \\nterm surface transportation funding issue. American prosperity is \\nclosely linked to the ability to move goods and materials seamlessly \\nwithin the Great Lakes region, which produces 35% of U.S. manufacturing \\noutput, provides 42% of U.S. manufacturing jobs, and accounts for 28% \\nof U.S. exports. In the Midwest, the nation\\'s industrial core, a single \\ndisruption in a ``just in time\\'\\' supply chain component due to \\ninadequate infrastructure can impact results throughout the entire \\nchain.\\n\\nThe Great Lakes Metro Chambers Coalition urges the House Ways and Means \\nCommittees to develop a sustainable funding solution that will provide \\nadequate Federal resources for the maintenance and development of our \\nNation\\'s surface transportation systems. The Coalition is deeply \\nconcerned about the rapidly approaching surface transportation \\nreauthorization cliff, as well as the projected tremendous shortfall in \\nFederal Highway Trust Fund revenues over the long haul as motor \\nvehicles become far more efficient and motor fuel tax revenues become \\nmuch less predictable. The need for significant progress on \\ninfrastructure is urgent.\\n\\nHistorically, increased user fees have been the prescription for \\nprojected revenue shortages in the Federal Highway Trust Fund. The \\nCoalition believes that fees from users should remain the basis for \\nfunding our nation\\'s transportation infrastructure. However, we \\nrecognize that to meet the. funding challenges in the near term, the \\nCongress may need to look to a broader range of revenue sources and \\nthat user fees may be just one of the options. The Coalition is \\ntherefore prepared to support other responsible options, such as \\nrepatriation of foreign taxes, which could provide significant near \\nterm and medium term relief.\\n\\nAs Congress grapples with this issue that is so important to our \\nnation\\'s future, we encourage legislators to also provide flexible \\noptions for the states that can supplement federal resources and help \\nprovide a greater impact in catching up and keeping up with our \\ninfrastructure needs. One of those options is tolling on interstate \\nhighway systems and federal aid highways. Tolling can supplement motor \\nfuel revenues in providing resources to maintain and develop heavily \\nused corridors. It is already used on a number of key arteries in our \\nregion and has helped immeasurably in keeping them in good condition. \\nIts technology is well-developed and now allows for efficient movement \\nand minimal congestion.\\n\\nThe Great Lakes Metro Chambers Coalition urges the Congress to allow \\nstates the option to use tolling on interstate systems and federal aid \\nhighways in heavily travelled corridors. Tolling can supplement the use \\nof other funding streams, reduce some of the pressure on federal \\nresources, and help states and localities address many of their serious \\nproblems with roads that feed into and support the interstate highway \\nsystem. Tolling is also consistent with the Coalition\\'s strongly held \\nbelief that user fees are the best sources of sustainable funding \\nresources for transportation corridors.\\n\\nCongressional action is essential to secure the trade corridors that \\nget the region\\'s manufactured and agricultural goods and commodities to \\nmarket. Providing adequate, stable and predictable resources will \\neliminate the barriers which have combined to delay rebuilding our \\nnation\\'s infrastructure. The Coalition will support your leadership on \\nthis vital issue.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nEd Wolking, Jr.\\nExecutive Director\\nGreat Lakes Metro Chambers Coalition\\nContributing Chambers of Commerce:\\n\\nAnn Arbor/Ypsilanti Regional Chamber of Commerce\\nAllegheny Conference\\nBattle Creek Area Chamber of Commerce\\nBuffalo Niagara Partnership\\nCanton Regional Chamber of Commerce\\nChicagoland Chamber of Commerce\\nCincinnati USA Regional Chamber\\nColumbus Chamber of Commerce\\nDayton Area Chamber of Commerce\\nDetroit Regional Chamber\\nDuluth Chamber of Commerce\\nErie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership\\nFox Cities Chamber of Commerce and Industry\\nGrand Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce\\nGreater Akron Chamber of Commerce\\nGreater Cleveland Partnership\\nGreater Des Moines Partnership\\nGreater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce\\nGreater Louisville Inc.--The Metro Chamber of Commerce\\nGreater Niagara Chamber of Commerce\\nGreater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce\\nLancaster Chamber of Commerce and Industry\\nLansing Regional Chamber of Commerce\\nMetropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce\\nMichigan West Coast Chamber of Commerce\\nMinneapolis Regional Chamber of Commerce\\nMuskegon Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce\\nNorthern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce\\nNorthern Michigan Chamber Alliance\\nPlattsburgh North Country Chamber of Commerce\\nQuad Cities Chamber\\nRockford Chamber of Commerce\\nSaint Paul Area Chamber of Commerce\\nSouthwest Michigan First\\nToledo Regional Chamber of Commerce\\nTraverse City Area Chamber of Commerce\\nYoungstown/Warren Regional Chamber of Commerce\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n                        Highway Materials Group\\n\\n                                  ACAA\\n\\n                           ACPA www.acpa.org\\n\\n                Associated Equipment Distributors (AED)\\n\\n              Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM)\\n\\n              Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute (CRSI)\\n\\n              National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA)\\n\\n           National Ready Mixed Concrete Association (NRMCA)\\n\\n          National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association (NSSGA)\\n\\n                   Portland Cement Association (PCA)\\n\\n                        Comments for the Record\\n\\n                            submitted to the\\n\\n               United States Senate Committee on Finance\\n\\n                Dead End, No Turn Around, Danger Ahead:\\n\\n              Challenges to the Future of Highway Funding\\n\\n                             June 18, 2015\\n\\nDear Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, and esteemed members of the \\nFinance Committee:\\n\\nOn behalf of the Highway Materials Group, we submit the following \\nstatement. The Highway Materials Group is composed of nine \\norganizations that provide the materials that are essential to road and \\nhighway construction and the equipment manufacturers and distributors \\nthat move those materials. The group includes the American Coal Ash \\nAssociation, American Concrete Pavement Association; Associated \\nEquipment Distributors; Association of Equipment Manufacturers; \\nConcrete Reinforcing Steel Institute; National Asphalt Pavement \\nAssociation; National Ready Mixed Concrete Association; National Stone, \\nSand & Gravel Association; and the Portland Cement Association. \\nTogether, these nine trade associations represent thousands of \\ncompanies that provide hundreds of thousands of direct highway \\nconstruction jobs.\\n\\nWe are united around the common issue of a long-term, Federal-aid \\nHighway authorization bill that both increases highway investments, and \\naddresses the Highway Trust Fund with durable solutions that both \\nstabilize and increase highway investments now and for the long term.\\n\\nSince 2008, the mantra of ``doing more with less\\'\\' has had grave \\nimplications for the transportation-construction industry, State \\ntransportation agencies, and the system of highways and bridges that \\nevery citizen depends upon for personal mobility, commodity flows, \\nsafety, and security in times when our system is tested in natural \\ndisasters and other emergencies.\\n\\nWe recognize the vast number of issues Congress must address. Investing \\nin America\\'s infrastructure should be a top priority for lawmakers. \\nHowever, 33 extensions over the past 6 years and an unknown number of \\ndelays in transportation funding are causing not only the nation\\'s \\nsystem of highways and bridges to fall further into disrepair, but is \\ncrippling the ability of our economy to grow and prosper.\\n\\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) rates our overall \\ninfrastructure between poor and mediocre. Within ASCE\\'s analysis, they \\nreport 1 in 9 of the nation\\'s bridges are structurally deficient and 42 \\npercent of urban highways are congested and cost the economy $101 \\nbillion in wasted time and fuel each year.\\n\\nOur industries and our customers in the public sector have an extremely \\ndifficult time planning for the future, and there is great concern that \\nwithout a firm commitment from Congress, backed by bold and decisive \\nsteps to fix the Highway Trust Fund and authorize a 6-year \\ntransportation program, the nation\\'s surface transportation \\ninfrastructure will fall further behind in terms of rehabilitation, \\nrepair, preservation and expansion.\\n\\nThe Highway Materials Group has four basic principles that we urge the \\nCommittee to consider. They include the following:\\n\\nTransportation Infrastructure is the Backbone of America\\'s Economic \\nProsperity--America\\'s economic vitality and ability to compete in the \\nglobal marketplace depends on an integrated national, intermodal \\nsurface transportation network that reliably moves goods and people to \\nmaximize global competitiveness, quality of life, and economic \\nprosperity for all citizens. Unfortunately, the investments needed to \\nmaintain and expand the highway system have been inadequate. As a \\nresult, America is ill-prepared to meet the competitive demands of the \\nglobal economy. To ensure economic prosperity and global \\ncompetitiveness, the nation needs to invest in multi-modal \\ntransportation infrastructure systems that not only keep pace with \\ntoday\\'s businesses and industries, but also that will allow for the \\nhealthy expansion in the future.\\n\\nThe Federal Government Must Remain Committed and Involved--Maintaining \\na vital, national infrastructure has been a federal responsibility \\nsince the founding of the Republic. Congress is tasked with \\nestablishing ``post roads,\\'\\' pre-cursors of today\\'s national highway \\nsystem, and regulating commerce among the states and with other \\nnations. Commerce is the lifeblood of our Nation\\'s economy, and \\nAmerica\\'s transportation infrastructure is its circulatory system. This \\nnetwork of roads and transportation structures--built by Americans \\nemployed in well-paying jobs that cannot be exported--is essential for \\nthe economic growth, safety, security, freedom of mobility, and quality \\nof life benefiting every American. We oppose efforts to transfer this \\nresponsibility to the states as an unfunded federal mandate.\\n\\nWe Support a User-Fee Based Funding Solution--In order to overcome the \\nhighway funding gap, we support the adoption of any user-fee based \\nfunding options and innovative finance tools to provide federal and \\nstate transportation departments with the funding they need to make \\ncritical investments in our transportation infrastructure. It is our \\ncontention that a user fee based funding approach, such as a motor fuel \\nbased user fee, is the most rational and easily implementable funding \\nsolution available in the short to medium term. Our position is \\nconsistent with that of President Ronald Reagan, who in 1982 noted: \\n``Good tax policy decrees that wherever possible a fee for a service \\nshould be assigned against those who directly benefit from that \\nservice. Our highways were built largely with such a user fee--the \\ngasoline tax. I think it makes sense to follow that principle in \\nrestoring them to the condition we all want them to be in.\\'\\' Moreover, \\nwe believe that continued extensions are not a solution, and is in fact \\nthe lease fiscally conservative approach to address this challenge.\\n\\nTimeliness and Long-term Authorization Are Essential--The longer \\nCongress delays in making the investments necessary to our highways, \\nroads and bridges, the more difficult and expensive it will be for our \\nnation to finance this critical and necessary endeavor. At a time when \\ncost is paramount, Congress must act now. Timely enactment of a 6 year \\nauthorization bill is critical for state transportation departments to \\nplan and budget for projects and for our industry to make critical \\nbusiness decisions.\\n\\nIn closing, Congress should embrace the opportunity to invest in \\nAmerica\\'s infrastructure. It is the only way our economy will be \\npositioned for success in a vibrant and growing global economy. America \\nhas the strongest economy in the world thanks to the investments made \\nby a previous generation of American leaders who understood the value \\nof infrastructure, and recognized that investing in roads and bridges \\nis the best path toward prosperity for our great Nation. Many of \\nAmerica\\'s critical highways and bridges have reached the end of the \\ndesign life and must be rebuilt. Every day we delay making the \\nnecessary investments in our infrastructure exacerbates an already \\ncritical situation.\\n\\nWe thank the Committee for holding this important hearing on the long \\nterm health of the Highway Trust Fund. We urge Congress to address the \\ncritical highway needs of the country and enact the revenue necessary \\nto fund a multi-year surface transportation authorization now.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n            INSTITUTE ON TAXATION AND ECONOMIC POLICY (ITEP)\\n\\n                               __________\\n            Informing the debate over tax policy nationwide\\n                               __________\\n\\n            Adding Sustainability to the Highway Trust Fund\\n\\n             Testimony for the Senate Committee on Finance\\n                       For the hearing entitled:\\n               ``Dead End, No Turn Around, Danger Ahead: \\n             Challenges to the Future of Highway Funding\\'\\'\\n                     Carl Davis, Research Director\\n            Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP)\\n                             June 18, 2015\\n\\nThe Federal Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is the single most important \\nmechanism for funding maintenance and improvements to the nation\\'s \\ntransportation infrastructure. Absent Congressional action, however, \\nthe HTF will face insolvency at the end of July. Unfortunately, despite \\nthe critical importance of infrastructure to the U.S. economy, the \\ncondition of the HTF has been allowed to deteriorate to the point that \\nimminent insolvency has become entirely normal.\\n\\nSince 2008, Congress has dealt with recurring shortfalls in the HTF \\nthrough a series of short-term patches that have collectively \\ntransferred $65 billion in outside funding to the account. While these \\ntransfers have played an important role in funding the nation\\'s \\ntransportation network, they also represent a failure to deal with the \\nroot cause of these recurring shortfalls: an outdated and poorly \\ndesigned gasoline tax.\\n\\nIncreasing and reforming the gas tax could adequately and sustainably \\nfund the HTF for decades to come. New funding sources such as a vehicle \\nmiles traveled tax (VMT tax), on the other hand, hold some long-term \\npromise but cannot address the fund\\'s current shortfall and are not \\nnecessarily a panacea for the HTF\\'s revenue sustainability problem. \\nFinally, other high profile funding options such as repatriation \\nholiday or deemed repatriation of corporate profits are problematic \\nfrom a tax policy perspective, and entirely unsustainable as revenue \\nraising options.\\nGas Tax Design is Flawed but Fixable\\nThe HTF is currently facing insolvency because the federal gas tax is \\npoorly designed. On October 1st, the nation\\'s 18.4 cent per gallon \\nfederal gas tax rate will become 22 years old. As a result, drivers \\nhave been paying roughly $3 in federal gas taxes on every tank of gas \\nthey have bought over the last two decades. But as drivers\\' \\ncontributions have stagnated, the cost of asphalt, steel, and machinery \\nhas risen by roughly 60 percent.\\\\1\\\\ This growing disconnect between the \\ncost of the roads that drivers use, and the price they pay to use them, \\nhas played a large role in causing HTF revenues to consistently fall \\nshort of infrastructure needs.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ This covers the 1993-2013 period in order to be consistent with \\nthe fuel-efficiency figures cited below. To be clear, this does not \\nsuggest that construction costs have grown in an unprecedented or \\nunexpected way. Prices in the broader economy, as measured by the \\nConsumer Price Index, rose by 61 percent over this same period.\\n\\nSimply put, the 18.4 cent federal gas tax rate is outdated. Federal \\nfunding for the nation\\'s transportation infrastructure would be on a \\nmuch more sustainable course if the rate had been allowed to rise \\nalongside inflation in the same manner that numerous income tax \\nprovisions did over this time period (e.g., personal exemptions, \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nstandard deductions, tax brackets, and the Earned Income Tax Credit).\\n\\nBut a lack of planning for inflation is not the only challenge facing \\nthe federal gas tax. According to the Federal Highway Administration, \\nthe average fuel-efficiency of a passenger vehicle on America\\'s \\nroadways has increased by roughly 12 percent over the last two \\ndecades--from 19.3 to 21.6 miles per gallon.\\\\2\\\\ For a vehicle with a 15 \\ngallon gas tank, this means that the average driver is able to wear \\ndown the roadways with 35 extra miles of driving before they have to \\nstop, refuel, and pay anything in gas taxes. The result has been \\nreduced gas tax collections, and less revenue with which to maintain \\nand improve the nation\\'s transportation network.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\2\\\\ See Table VM-1 from the Federal Highway Administration\\'s \\nHighway Statistics series. 1993 data for ``passenger cars\\'\\' and ``2-\\naxle, 4-tire trucks\\'\\' are available at: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/\\n1994/section5/vm-1.pdf and 2013 data for ``all light duty vehicles\\'\\' \\nare available at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/\\n2013/vm1.cfm.\\n\\nIn late 2013, ITEP examined the impact of both inflation and fuel-\\nefficiency growth in significant detail and concluded that inflation \\nhas, by far, played the larger role in contributing to the HTF funding \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nshortfalls of recent years:\\n\\n        Over three-fourths (78 percent) of the current gasoline tax \\n        revenue shortfall is a result of Congress\\' failure to plan for \\n        inevitable growth in the cost of building and maintaining the \\n        nation\\'s infrastructure. The remainder (22 percent) is due to \\n        improvements in vehicle fuel-efficiency.\\\\3\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. ``A Federal Gas Tax \\nfor the Future.\\'\\' September 22, 2013.

Immediately increasing the gas tax \\nand allowing the rate to rise each year alongside a formula that \\nconsiders both inflation and fuel-efficiency gains would put the HTF on \\na sustainable course for decades to come. Had this reform been \\nimplemented in the late 1990s, there would be no question as to the \\nHTF\\'s solvency as the fund would have ran a surplus in every subsequent \\nyear, thereby facilitating as much as $215 billion in additional \\ntransportation investments.

In May 2015, Governor Nathan Deal signed a reform that \\naddresses both of the major challenges to the sustainability of the \\nstate\\'s gas tax. In addition to a flat, one-time increase in the tax, \\nGeorgia\\'s gas tax rate will now be allowed to rise each year to keep \\npace with both inflation and vehicle fuel-efficiency gains. While the \\ninflation component of this formula is not unusual (similar formulas \\nexist in Florida, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Utah), the fuel-\\nefficiency inflator is the first of its kind.\\nIssues With Vehicle Miles Traveled Taxes\\nAs electric and highly efficient vehicles have grown in popularity, \\nincreased attention has been paid to proposals that would transition \\nthe nation\\'s system of transportation finance away from taxes on motor \\nfuel and toward taxes directly on the number of miles driven. On July \\n1, Oregon will take a significant first step in this direction by \\nallowing 5,000 volunteer drivers to permanently exempt themselves from \\nthe state\\'s gasoline tax in exchange for paying a 1.5 cent tax on each \\nmile that they drive.\\\\7\\\\ While this experiment is a welcome example of \\nforward thinking, there are at least three important caveats to keep in \\nmind.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\7\\\\ See Senate Bill 810 of Oregon\\'s 2013 Regular Session. \\nAdditional information on the program is available at http://\\nwww.myorego.org/.\\n\\nFirst, VMT taxes are not a solution to the immediate funding challenges \\nfacing the HTF, or to the broader infrastructure funding needs that \\nexist right now. Recent opinion polling shows that VMT taxes are \\nunpopular among the American people, though this may change as people \\nbecome more familiar with these types of taxes.\\\\8\\\\ Moreover, installing \\nthe devices needed to track and report vehicle mileage is a costly and \\ntime consuming endeavor that could take years or even decades to fully \\nimplement, depending on whether efforts are made to retrofit current \\nvehicles with the technology.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\8\\\\ Agrawal, Asha Weinstein and Hilary Nixon. ``How Do Americans \\nFeel About Taxes and Fees to Fund Transportation?\\'\\' Mineta \\nTransportation Institute.

Oregon\\'s flat \\nVMT tax of 1.5 cents per mile, for example, is exactly as vulnerable to \\ninflation as the state\\'s flat gas tax of 30 cents per gallon. As we \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nexplained in a recent report on this subject:\\n\\n        Transitioning from a pay-per-gallon gas tax to a pay-per-mile \\n        VMT tax will not necessarily put federal and state \\n        transportation revenues on a sustainable course. If the tax \\n        rate levied under a VMT tax is not allowed to grow alongside \\n        the inflation rate, revenues will quickly begin to lag behind \\n        the cost of building and maintaining the nation\\'s \\n        infrastructure-much as gas tax revenues have for decades. \\n        Lawmakers interested in adequately funding transportation on an \\n        ongoing basis should immediately index their gas tax rates to \\n        inflation, and should be aware that such indexing will also be \\n        needed under any VMT tax they might enact.\\\\9\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\9\\\\ Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. ``Pay-Per-Mile Tax \\nis Only a Partial Fix.\\'\\' May 28, 2014.

Oregon\\'s upcoming experiment, for example, \\nis expected to be very popular among owners of fuel-inefficient cars \\nwho purchase larger volumes of gasoline (and pay higher gas taxes) \\nrelative to their neighbors. Paying by the mile, rather than by the \\ngallon, will be of such great benefit to these drivers that lawmakers \\nput a firm cap on the number of inefficient cars allowed into the \\nexperiment (only 1,500 slots are reserved for vehicles rated at 17 \\nmiles per gallon or less). Hybrid and electric vehicle owners, by \\ncontrast, will fare quite poorly under this program. The Oregon \\nDepartment of Transportation calculates that a Toyota Prius owner could \\nsee their taxes rise by as much as $117 per year under this tax.\\\\10\\\\ \\nWhile some of this disparity could be alleviated by reducing the tax \\nrate for vehicles that get better gas mileage, this option has not been \\na central part of most VMT tax discussions thus far.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\10\\\\ Oregon Department of Transportation. ``How does the road usage \\ncharge compare with paying the fuel tax?\\'\\' May 2015.

These proposals would reward and encourage offshore tax \\navoidance, while at best only providing a temporary fix to the gap in \\nfunding.\\n\\nThe most problematic proposal in this category is known as a \\nrepatriation holiday. Under a repatriation holiday, multinational \\ncorporations could voluntarily bring back profits held offshore by \\npaying tax on those profits at a rate much lower than the 35 percent \\nrate they would normally owe (one such proposal would set the \\nrepatriation rate as low as 6.5 percent).\\n\\nBut repatriation holidays are not a sustainable funding source for the \\nHTF because they would actually lose revenue in the medium and long \\nterm. In fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) found that a \\nrepatriation holiday could cost as much as $96 billion in just 10 \\nyears.\\\\11\\\\ This is because the holiday would encourage companies to \\nhoard even more of their future profits in offshore tax havens in \\nanticipation of another holiday, and because much of the money \\nrepatriated under a holiday would have been eventually repatriated at a \\nhigher tax rate if the holiday were not enacted.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\11\\\\ Barthold, Thomas A.

For example, President Barrack Obama \\nhas proposed paying for infrastructure with a 14 percent mandatory tax \\non unrepatriated profits as part of a broad corporate tax reform that \\nwould include a 19 percent minimum tax on foreign profits moving \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nforward.\\n\\nAs with a voluntary repatriation holiday, however, this form of \\nmandatory repatriation would reward companies for their current \\noffshore tax dodging with a special lower rate, and would incentivize \\ncompanies to shift more of their operations offshore in order to enjoy \\nthe lower rate.\\n\\nIn addition, while both proposals would raise revenue in the short-\\nterm, they are not sustainable solutions. If the HTF is simply patched \\nwith a repatriation tax, the fund will inevitably face insolvency yet \\nagain in the very near future. The result would be a quick return to \\nthe same debate that has been rehashed repeatedly from at least 2008 to \\nthe present, and a continued lack of certainty for the agencies \\nresponsible for maintaining and enhancing the nation\\'s infrastructure.\\nConclusion\\nThe root cause of the Highway Trust Fund\\'s looming insolvency is that \\nits primary revenue source-the federal gas tax-is poorly designed. \\nSpecifically, the tax\\'s stagnant and outdated rate contains no \\nmechanism for growing with inflation, or for dealing with the more \\nrecent rise in vehicle fuel-efficiency.\\n\\nIn an effort to address these same flaws in their own gas taxes, state-\\nlevel lawmakers have increasingly been moving forward with gas tax \\nincreases and reforms that could serve as models for federal action on \\nthis issue. Rather than focusing on short-term solutions, a growing \\ngroup of states have transitioned toward a reformed, variable-rate gas \\ntax that can finance economically vital transportation investments in \\nboth the short and long terms.\\n\\nUnlike the gas tax, a new tax on the number of miles that drivers \\ntravel is not a realistic funding option in the short term. Moreover, \\nthis type of vehicle miles traveled tax (VMT tax) will be unsustainable \\nin the long-term as well if its tax rate is calculated as a flat amount \\nper mile, regardless of changes in inflation.\\n\\nOf all the proposals under consideration, repatriation is among the \\nmost problematic. A repatriation holiday could offer a short-term \\nrevenue boost but would provide no funding for transportation in the \\nmedium or long term, and would actually reduce federal revenues \\noverall. Additionally, any repatriation plan comes with the added \\ndownside of encouraging corporations to conduct more of their \\noperations offshore (either on paper or in reality).\\n\\nThe gas tax has been the cornerstone of transportation finance for \\nnearly 60 years. As the states have shown, this tax could continue to \\nplay this valuable role for decades to come if its rate is simply \\nupdated and reformed. Done correctly, the result could be an end to the \\nRTF\\'s perpetual funding crises for decades to come, and the beginning \\nof hugely valuable investments in the nation\\'s transportation \\ninfrastructure.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n                MILEAGE-BASED USER FEE ALLIANCE (MBUFA)\\n\\n           1050 K Street, NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20001\\n\\n                             www.mbufa.org\\n\\nContact: Barbara Rohde                                  June 18, 2015\\n(202) 312-7437                                          For Immediate \\nRelease\\n\\n                               Statement\\n\\n                      Senate Committee on Finance\\n\\n         Hearing on Challenges to the Future of Highway Funding\\n\\n    The Mileage-Based User Fee Alliance (MBUFA) is a national non-\\nprofit organization that brings together government, business, \\nacademic, and transportation policy leaders to conduct education and \\noutreach on the potential for mileage-based user fees as an alternative \\nfor future funding and improved performance of the U.S. transportation \\nsystem.\\n\\n    Jim Whitty is former Vice Chair of MBUFA and the manager of Oregon \\nDepartment of Transportation\\'s Office of Innovative Partnership \\nPrograms.

Manufacturers appreciate your commitment and interest \\nin securing the financial health of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF), the \\nmain funding mechanism for the nation\\'s highway and transit systems.\\n\\n    While competitor nations continue to ramp up investments in \\ntransportation infrastructure, the United States risks a continued \\nslide in the opposite direction. The level of real capital investment \\nin highways and roads declined 20 percent from 2003 to 2012.\\n\\n    A long-term approach to funding infrastructure is needed to avoid \\nuncertainty and ensure states have the ability to undertake multi-year \\nand complex transportation investments such as new bridge replacements, \\nimproved interchanges, transit upgrades and additional capacity to \\nrelieve congestion that chokes our roads. Because many states do not \\nhave the resources or ability to keep up with the demands of aging or \\ndeteriorating infrastructure, the federal and state partnership is \\ncritical to maintain. No state in our Union would be better off on its \\nown.\\n\\n    Transportation funding is a productive investment but manufacturers \\nurge caution when considering tax proposals that promise to provide the \\nresources for transportation investments over the next several years. \\nFor example, stand-alone proposals to tax overseas earnings outside of \\ncomprehensive tax reform represent a massive retroactive tax on \\nmanufacturers and would impose an additional cost burden on U.S. \\ncompanies at a time when they already face significant challenges in \\nthe global marketplace.\\n\\n    The federal government has a fundamental role to play in investing \\nin the nation\\'s highways and transit systems to serve passenger travel, \\ninterstate commerce and national defense. Unlike most other government \\nprograms, the HTF was designed to be funded by federal fuel taxes and \\ntruck excise fees paid by those who use and benefit from access to our \\ntransportation networks. We encourage the Senate to recognize the \\nimportance of user fees in developing a solution to the current HTF \\nfunding crisis in addition to the other potential funding mechanisms, \\nbut also begin to develop future pathways that will lead to new \\napproaches that will ensure appropriate funding levels in the years to \\ncome.\\n\\n    Manufacturers welcome the Administration, the House and Senate \\nworking together to take decisive action on a multi-year funding \\nsolution for the HTF.

NADA is a national \\ntrade association that represents 16,000 franchised new car and truck \\ndealers and collectively employs more than one million individuals. \\nNADA has almost 1,800 ATD members, which represents 82 percent of \\ncommercial truck dealers.\\n\\nMAP-21, the current highway authorization, will expire on July 31, \\n2015. While there is bipartisan support for a long-term highway bill, \\nthe biggest challenge is funding the currently insolvent Highway Trust \\nFund (HTF). If Congress were to maintain the Federal surface \\ntransportation program at current levels, the HTF would need an \\nadditional $168 billion in revenue through 2025.\\\\1\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ ``Projections of Highway Trust Fund Accounts,\\'\\' CBO March 2015 \\nBaseline, issued January 26, 2015. http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/\\nfiles/cbofiles/attachments/43884-2015-03-Highway\\nTrustFund.pdf\\n\\nCurrently, a 12 percent Federal excise tax (FET) on new heavy-duty \\ntrucks contributes revenues to the HTF. Proposals have been made to \\nincrease the FET as a way to raise revenue for the depleted HTF. The \\nFET already depresses new truck sales and increasing this tax would \\nfurther slow deployment of cleaner, safer, and more fuel efficient \\ntrucks. Congress should also consider lowering or eliminating the tax \\nto address the detrimental impacts of the tax on safety, the \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nenvironment, and the truck industry.\\n\\nThe truck FET was originally imposed in 1917 to help defray the cost of \\nWorld War I.\\\\2\\\\ This tax, applicable to most new highway heavy-duty \\ntrucks, tractors, and trailers, has risen from 3 percent of the selling \\nprice to 12 percent today, making it the highest percentage excise tax \\nCongress levies. With the average retail price of a new heavy-duty \\ntruck near an all-time high of $169,000, the 12% FET costs truck \\ncustomers roughly $20,000.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\2\\\\ FHWA, Federal Tax Rates on Motor Vehicles and Related Products, \\nSeptember 1999: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/hs98/tables/fe101b.pdf. In \\nrecent years, some even have suggested increasing the FET. For example, \\nin 2013, the Senate Finance Committee included an FET increase of 1 \\npercent (to 13 percent) in an ``options paper\\'\\' on infrastructure \\nfunding. Additionally, a Government Accountability Office report, \\n``Highway Trust Fund, Pilot Program Could Help Determine the Viability \\nof Mileage Fees for Certain Vehicles,\\'\\' (December 13, 2012) concluded \\nthat Congress consider ``new revenues\\'\\' on commercial trucking.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the FET has the effect of discouraging businesses from \\nbuying new heavy-duty trucks that are safer, cleaner, and more fuel \\nefficient, and encourages trucking companies to hold on to their older \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ntrucks longer.\\n\\nAn increase in the FET would be in addition to the cost of new federal \\nemissions and fuel economy mandates that are increasing the price of \\nnew heavy-duty trucks. For example, the Owner Operator Independent \\nDrivers Associations (OOIDA) calculated the average per truck \\nregulatory costs associated with the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s \\n(EPA) MY 2004-2010 truck emissions standards to be $20,000-30,000.\\\\3\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ Scott Grenerth (professional driver and member of OOIDA), \\ntestimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform \\n(October 12, 2011).\\n\\nAdditionally, EPA has proposed a new set of commercial truck fuel \\neconomy/greenhouse gas rules that require fuel economy increases of up \\nto 24% by 2027. The Obama administration estimates that its proposal, \\nphased in between model year 2018 and 2027, will cost at least $25 \\nbillion or some three times the estimated cost of Phase 1. According to \\na recent New York Times article, ``It is expected that the new rules \\nwill add $12,000 to $14,000 to the manufacturing cost of a new tractor-\\ntrailer. . . .\\'\\' \\\\4\\\\ Together, the cost of these new standards, coupled \\nwith associated increases in the FET, will price many truck purchasers \\nout of the market.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\4\\\\ Aaron M. Kessler and Coral Davenport, ``E.P.A. Proposal Will \\nPut Bigger Trucks on a Fuel Diet,\\'\\' The New York Times, (May 30, 2015).\\n\\nThe complexity of assessing and remitting the FET is another major area \\nof concern. Truck dealers spend considerable time and attention \\nnavigating the byzantine and complex IRS regulations associated with \\nthe collection of the tax. ATD continually gets questions from truck \\ndealerships regarding how FET should be calculated and collected. In \\nfact, ATD\\'s guide for truck dealers on collecting and remitting the FET \\nis over one hundred pages long. The many exceptions and gray areas \\nrelated to the FET make it ripe for IRS audit and impose significant \\nfinancial and administrative challenges for small business truck \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ndealerships and customers alike to stay in compliance.\\n\\nThe HTF is in desperate need of reliable and consistent funding into \\nthe future. The FET fails to provide certainty and in fact is a very \\nvolatile tax. For example, the FET generated a little over $1.4 billion \\nin 2008 when truck sales took a hit during the recession.\\\\5\\\\ In 2013, \\non the other hand when the truck market came back $3.2 billion was \\ngenerated for the HTF.\\\\6\\\\ The FET is not a user fee but a tax on a \\nproduct. When truck sales are down the revenue into the HTF is directly \\nimpacted.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\5\\\\ FHWA, Office of Highway Policy Information, October 2007 to \\nSeptember 2008: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/\\n2008/fe10_2008.cfm.\\n    \\\\6\\\\ FHWA, Office of Highway Policy Information, October 2012 to \\nSeptember 2013: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/\\n2013/fe10.cfm.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nH. Con. Res. 33\\nH. Con. Res. 33, introduced by Reps. Reid Ribble (R-WI) and Tim Walz \\n(D-MN), is a bipartisan concurrent resolution that would put Congress \\non record in opposition to any increase in the FET on heavy-duty trucks \\nand trailers. ATD strongly supports this bipartisan resolution which to \\ndate has 26 cosponsors. The following organizations have endorsed this \\nconcurrent resolution: American Highway Users Alliance, American Truck \\nDealers, Daimler Trucks North America, Mack Trucks, Inc., Meritor \\nWABCO, NAFA Fleet Management Association, National Trailer Dealers \\nAssociation, Navistar, NTEA--The Association for the Work Truck \\nIndustry, Owner Operator Independent Drivers Association, Recreation \\nVehicle Industry Association, Truck and Engine Manufacturers \\nAssociation, Truck Renting and Leasing Association, Truck Trailer \\nManufacturers Association and Volvo Trucks North America.\\nConclusion\\nATD strongly supports an equitable long-term funding solution for the \\nHTF designed to ensure that Americans travel safely on our roads and \\nthere is a reliable roadway system for goods to travel to market in a \\ncost effective manner. ATD believes that a user fee approach is the \\nfairest and most efficient way to achieve these goals. Finally, \\nCongress should not only oppose any increase in the FET, since this \\nexcise tax contradicts government mandates for a cleaner, safer, and \\nmore fuel efficient truck fleet, but it should also examine the adverse \\nimpacts of the FET policy particularly on the nearly 7 million \\nAmericans employed in the trucking industry.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n               National Conference of State Legislatures\\n\\n       <SUP>The</SUP> Forum</SUP> for</SUP> America\\'s</SUP> Ideas\\n\\n   </SUP>444 North Capitol Street, N.W., Suite 515, Washington, D.C. \\n              20001; Tel: 202-624-5400 ?

It represents a \\nkey step in examining the need for federal transportation \\ninfrastructure investments. It is important that all parties, including \\nstate legislatures, work together to ensure a safe and reliable surface \\ntransportation system throughout the country.\\n\\n    As you know, on August 1st the highway account of the Highway Trust \\nFund (HTF) is forecast to fall below the critical $4 billion funding \\nlevel. This will likely result in the U.S. Secretary of Transportation \\nemploying certain cash management strategies that could both delay or \\nreduce reimbursements to states for critical surface transportation \\ninfrastructure projects. NCSL urges Congress to ensure the continued \\nsolvency of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF), while committing to adopt a \\nlong-term agreement on surface transportation funding as part of a \\nmulti-year reauthorization of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st \\nCentury Act (MAP-21).\\n\\n     Although the enactment of MAP-21 in 2012 put a brief end to the \\nnumerous short-term extensions that followed the expiration of the \\nSafe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation Equity Act: A \\nLegacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) in 2009, it unfortunately appears that \\nCongress is returning to this pattern. The uncertainty that pervades \\nshort-term extensions makes it extremely challenging for states to \\nadequately plan and achieve their performance targets especially \\nbecause many transportation infrastructure projects require a multi-\\nyear commitment. This uncertainty has already caused some states to \\ndefer projects. These delays have a harmful impact on a state\\'s \\neconomy. It is difficult to overstate the negative state impacts this \\nuncertainty creates.\\n\\n    Despite federal inaction, over the past 2\\\\1/2\\\\ years, state \\nlegislators in more than a quarter of states, from Maryland and \\nVirginia to Utah and South Dakota, have stepped forward and invested \\nbillions of dollars to repair and upgrade our nation\\'s surface \\ntransportation assets to ensure their continued safety and viability. \\nHowever, the significant steps taken by many states must not be \\nmisconstrued. NCSL is a strong supporter of the federal government\\'s \\nrole in a national surface transportation system that facilitates \\ninterstate commerce, addresses fairly and equally the mobility needs of \\nall Americans and meets our national defense needs. We would also \\nstress that NCSL supports the continuation and preservation of a \\nfederal-aid surface transportation program that directs spending to \\nnational priorities while providing flexibility for states to address \\nregional variations. The federal program should provide states maximum \\nflexibility in deciding how to generate and leverage transportation \\nrevenues and how to use state and federal dollars. The ability of \\nstates to maintain flexibility in decision making and comply with \\nenvironmental and other mandates depends on regulatory flexibility as \\nwell as adequate and reliable federal funding.\\n\\n    Revenues for our transportation system continue to decline as \\nvehicles become more fuel efficient and travel patterns change \\nnationwide. The American Society of Civil Engineers has estimated \\nAmerica\\'s surface transportation infrastructure faces a funding gap of \\nabout $94 billion a year based on current spending levels.\\\\1\\\\ Taking \\nall of this into account, NCSL urges Congress to work closely with \\nstates to develop a new shared, long-term vision for financing and \\nfunding our nation\\'s surface transportation systems, one that will \\nenhance the nation\\'s prosperity, the quality of life of all Americans \\nand guide it beyond the Interstate Highway era into the 21st century. \\nNCSL believes that Congress must:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ American Society of Civil Engineers. ``2013 Report Card for \\nAmerica\\'s Infrastructure.\\'\\' May 2013. http://\\nwww.infrastructurereportcard.org/.\\n\\n\\x01  Provide a short term increase in federal highway transportation \\nfunding, based on the current status of the Highway Trust fund, so that \\nsufficient funds are available for the next authorization until a new, \\nmore stable long-term funding mechanism for surface transportation can \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nbe put in place.\\n\\n\\x01  Examine innovative funding systems that capture all system users and \\nencourages pilot programs in states for experimentation with \\napproaches, methods and mechanisms.

Their intent is to place local transportation programs on a \\nmore stable and predictable footing that is less subject to the \\nvagaries of Congressional budgeting. Twenty-five states have taken \\nsteps to raise transportation revenue this year and another 16 states \\nare currently in the process of doing so (for the latest summary of \\nstate funding initiatives see the attached appendix and the report of \\nthe American Road and Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA) at\\nhttp://www.transportationinvestment.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May-\\n2015-State-Transportation-Funding-Initiatives-Report.pdf)\\n\\nCollectively, these measures are generating billions of additional \\ndollars, enabling states to assume greater responsibility for \\nmaintaining local infrastructure and paying for transportation \\nimprovements of local benefit, such as those involved in the ``TIGER \\nGrants,\\'\\' the ``Transportation Alternatives\\'\\' program and the ``Surface \\nTransportation Program\\'\\' (STP). Shifting these activities and other \\nexpenditures of low federal priority out of the Highway Trust Fund \\ncould eventually bring Trust Fund spending into balance with incoming \\ngas tax revenues--and fulfil one of the goals of the recently adopted \\njoint Congressional Budget Resolution (See, Conference Report on \\nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2016, April 29, \\n2015). It also would restore the Trust Fund to its primary function of \\nserving as a source of funds for programs that are clearly of federal \\nconcern or national significance--notably, maintaining and upgrading \\nthe Interstate Highway network and the National Highway System, fixing \\naging bridges and modernizing critical transit infrastructure.\\n\\nMost importantly, aligning Trust Fund expenditures with incoming Trust \\nFund revenue would place the Highway Trust Fund once again on a self-\\nsustaining basis. It would end the need for periodic transfers of \\ngeneral funds, do away with the awkward search for legitimate offsets \\n(or ``pay-fors\\'\\') and put an end to the constant lurching from one \\nfunding crisis to another.\\n\\nAs Robert Poole pointed out in his June 17 testimony before the House \\nWays and Means Committee, a Government Accountability Office analysis \\nof fiscal year 2013 Highway Trust Fund spending found that of the \\nentire $50.7 billion total, only $24 billion--less than half--was spent \\ndirectly on roads and bridges, and only $3 billion or 6 percent was \\ndevoted to actual construction, reconstruction or rehabilitation of \\nmajor projects. ``To me,\\'\\' Poole said, `` this finding cries out for \\nCongress to rethink and revamp how HTF monies are being used.\\'\\' \\n(Rethinking the Highway Trust Fund, testimony by Robert W. Poole, June \\n17, 2015, quoting Report GAO-15-33, October 2014).\\n\\nRestoring fiscal soundness to the Trust Fund is not ``devolution,\\'\\' a \\nconcept that calls for phasing out the federal gas tax and transferring \\nall authority over federal highway and transit programs to the states. \\n``I call this a judicious rebalancing of \\nfederal-state responsibilities for funding transportation,\\'\\' a senior \\nstate Republican lawmaker told reporters. ``States feel they have no \\nchoice but to assume more responsibility because they are not convinced \\nthey can rely on Congress for adequate and reliable funding. But the \\nfederal transportation program continues and the federal gas tax \\nremains an integral part of the highway funding system. The Democrats\\' \\ntalk of devolution is just a straw man.\\'\\'\\n\\nAnd indeed, the Congressional Budget Office projects a steady and \\npredictable stream of federal gas tax receipts of $40 billion per year \\nwell into the future ($35 billion is credited to the Highway Account, \\n$5 billion to the Transit Account, see Baseline Projections of Highway \\nTrust Fund Accounts, March 2015). This should put to rest the \\nmisleading notion that the Highway Trust Fund is about to ``go broke,\\'\\' \\nbecome ``insolvent\\'\\' or ``run out of money.\\'\\'\\n\\nA self-sustaining, stable annual $40 billion federal-aid transportation \\nbudget extending over a period of 6 to 10 years would go a long way \\ntoward restoring and improving the nation\\'s core surface transportation \\ninfrastructure. As proposed in a recent paper by Steven Lockwood, an \\nannual $35 billion highway budget would allow to address ``unique \\nfederal interest responsibilities\\'\\' such as maintaining and upgrading a \\nnational interconnected system of ``Highways of National Significance\\'\\' \\nand funding federal responsibilities for highway safety, R&D and \\nfederal lands roads. A $5 billion transit account would continue to \\nprovide funds for a program of transit investment (A Constrained \\nFederal-Aid Highway Program, by Steven Lockwood, Eno Center Newsletter, \\nJanuary 2015). The ``constrained\\'\\' $40 billion program would still be \\nable to provide states with certainty and continuity to pursue large \\ncapital intensive infrastructure projects of national significance that \\nrequire funding over multiple years.\\n\\n(However, because of prior obligations that have not yet been \\nliquidated, the transition to a self-sustaining program would need to \\nbe gradual. As reported by CBO\\'s Joseph Kile at the June 18th Senate \\nhearing, at the end of fiscal year 2014, $65 billion in contract \\nauthority had been obligated but not spent and another $6 billion was \\nstill available but not yet obligated, for a total of $91 billion in \\ncontract authority. These unliquidated obligations represent more than \\n2 years\\' worth of tax receipts. (The Status of the Highway Trust Fund, \\ntestimony by Joseph Kile, June 18, 2015).\\n\\n                                  ###\\n\\nThe June 17-18 hearings of the House Ways and Means Committee and the \\nSenate Finance Committee revealed an absence of a political consensus \\non how to pay for a long-term bill with its projected $85-90 billion \\nshortfall. The majority in Congress are firmly opposed to raising the \\ngas tax--most recently reaffirmed by Chairman Paul Ryan at the June 17 \\nhearing. (``We are not raising gas taxes, plain and simple\\'\\'). At the \\nsame time, the Senate Republican leadership is opposed to a tax on the \\naccumulated overseas corporate earnings (``. . . It is not a serious \\nproposal to pay for a long-term highway bill,\\'\\' said Finance Committee \\nchairman Orrin Hatch in his opening remarks at the June 18th hearing.) \\nAnother potential solution, a practical mileage-based road user fee, is \\n``a decade away\\'\\' Robert Poole told the committee.\\n\\nThere remains the option of gradually bringing spending into balance \\nwith incoming fuel tax revenue. This would require progressively \\nshifting funding responsibility for local transportation from the \\nHighway Trust Fund to the States and localities and limiting Trust Fund \\nrevenues to projects and programs that are truly federal in nature. \\nSuch a rebalancing of the federal-state relationship would require us \\nto accept a narrower concept of the federal role in transportation--but \\nit would offer probably the only lasting solution to the transportation \\nfunding crisis.\\n\\n                                  ###\\n\\nKenneth Orski is the editor and publisher of Innovation NewsBriefs, a \\ntransportation newsletter now in its 26th year of publication This \\nsubmission is in his own behalf.\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n2015 State Transportation Funding Initiatives\\n\\nThe following states have taken steps to raise transportation revenue \\n        this year:\\n\\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed $4.2 billion for transportation \\ninvestments as he began his second term. Florida: Gov. Rick Scott \\nproposed $9.9 billion for transportation (over $4 billion for roads and \\nbridges) in his 2015 budget request to the state legislature. North \\nDakota: Gov. Jack Dalrymple signed into law a bill that will provide \\n$450 million for state highway improvements. Another bill, known as the \\nSurge Funding Bill will dedicate $1.1 billion from the state\\'s \\nStrategic Investment and Improvement Fund for critical infrastructure \\nprojects. Iowa: Iowa legislature approved a 10-cent per gallon gas tax \\nincrease The increase will allow $700 million in spending on state \\nhighway projects and $200 million in local projects annually. The Iowa \\nHouse passed a $365.2 million transportation bill. Utah: The state \\nlegislature passed a bill that will increase the gas tax by 5 cents-\\nper-gallon, add a 12 percent tax on the wholesale price of gasoline and \\npermit counties to seek voter approval for a local sales tax for local \\ntransportation projects. South Dakota: The state legislature approved a \\nfuel tax increase of 6 cents per gallon; the bill also raises vehicle \\nlicense fees and gives local governments authority to levy their own \\nroad improvement fees. The measure is expected to generate over $80 \\nmillion/year for state and local programs. Montana: a bipartisan group \\nof state senators introduced a bill that calls for spending $50 million \\nin cash and $50 million in bond proceeds over 2 years on \\ninfrastructure. If state revenue receipts exceeded a certain trigger, \\nthe authorized amounts could rise as high as $100 million in cash and \\n$100 million in bond proceeds. Ohio: The House-Senate conference \\ncommittee approved a $7 billion transportation budget for the next 2 \\nyears and sent the bill to the Governor. Nebraska: The Nebraska \\nlegislature approved a 6 cent/gallon gas tax increase over the next 4 \\nyears, eventually expected to generate $76 million annually. Tennessee: \\nGov. Bill Haslam released a 3-year transportation program featuring \\n$1.2 billion in infrastructure investments. The program reflects the \\nstate\\'s commitment to remain debt-free, Haslam said. The budget ensures \\nthat projects already underway won\\'t be negatively impacted by \\ndecisions out of Washington, he added. Mississippi: The state \\nlegislature voted to raise $200 million in bond financing to pay for \\ntransportation improvements, most of them targeted at structurally \\ndeficient bridges. The measure takes effect July 1st. DOT Secretary \\nMelinda McGrath linked the legislature\\'s action to lack of action by \\nCongress. Idaho: the Idaho legislature passed a compromise $94.1 \\nmillion transportation bill funded with a 7-cent increase in the fuel \\ntax and vehicle registration fees. Minnesota: The Minnesota legislature \\npassed a $5.5 billion, 2-year bill. Georgia: Georgia Governor Nathan \\nDeal signed into law a bill that will increase transportation funding \\nby $900 million per year through increases in fuel taxes and vehicle \\nfees. Georgia thus joins Idaho, Iowa, South Dakota and Utah to have \\nincreased their gas tax to generate recurring transportation revenue. \\nThe measure also allows local governments to increase transportation-\\nrelated taxes. Atlanta voters approved a $188 million transportation \\ninfrastructure bond. Louisiana: The House Ways and Means Committee \\napproved a Democratic-sponsored one-cent sales tax increase and a 10-\\ncent gasoline tax increase that ``could pour billions into \\ntransportation improvements over the next decade.\\'\\' according to press \\nreports. Kansas: A gas tax hike, possibly of 5 to 10 cents, is under \\ndiscussion in the House committee, according to press reports. South \\nCarolina: The South Carolina House approved a 10 cent/gallon (or 60 \\npercent) gas tax increase that will provide at least $370 million for \\ntransportation projects. A competing Senate bill would generate $800 \\nmillion. Pennsylvania: The state House passed a measure that will \\nprovide up to $2.3 billion in annual transportation funding for \\nhighways ($1.3 billion), transit ($500 million) and local road \\nmaintenance. The measure raises revenue mainly by removing a cap on the \\nfranchise tax paid by fuel distributors. The Senate is expected to take \\nup the measure next. Vermont: Gov. Peter Shumlin signed a $616 million \\ntransportation bill authorizing funds for fiscal year 2016. The bill \\nincludes $116 million for bridges and $100 million for road \\nresurfacing. California: California\\'s Senate is considering a bill that \\nwould raise the state gas tax by 10 cents/gallon and increase vehicle \\nsales and registration taxes. The bill is projected to generate more \\nthan $4 billion annually. In the lower house, Assembly Speaker Toni \\nAtkins proposes to create a road user fee to raise $2 billion over 5 \\nyears. A compromise state budget plan is yet to emerge. Washington: The \\nstate legislature approved and sent to the Governor a $7.6 billion \\ntransportation budget to keep existing transportation programs going. \\nAnother measure, to pay for new projects, is still being negotiated in \\nthe legislature. ``The current plan is the most positive movement that \\nwe\\'ve seen on transportation in this state for many, many years,\\'\\' said \\nSen. Joe Fain, Vice chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee. \\nTexas: Gov. Greg Abbott signed three transportation-related bills that, \\nin his words, provide ``a historic amount of funding\\'\\' to build roads. \\nThe bills include a measure that ends about $1.3 billion in diversions \\nof gas tax money for non highway items and a provision for a November \\nreferendum to approve amending the state constitution to dedicate $2.5 \\nbillion of the general sales tax and a portion of future motor vehicle \\nsales taxes to the highway fund. The combined pieces of legislation \\nprovide more than $4 billion a year for transportation. Oregon: June is \\nthe launch of the state\\'s new voluntary road usage charge program \\n(OReGO) that proponents view as a potential transportation funding \\nmodel for the nation, replacing the motor fuel tax. Connecticut: The \\nstate legislature and Gov. Dannel Malloy have reached agreement to \\nprovide $10 billion over the next 5 years for transportation, a $2.8 \\nbillion increase from last year, partially funded by redirecting one-\\nhalf cent from the state\\'s sales tax. This would be the largest \\ninvestment in transportation in the state\\'s history, the Governor \\nannounced. North Carolina: Gov. Pat McCrory has proposed a $2.85 \\nbillion bond initiative (Connect NC) to finance his 25-year statewide \\nmultimodal ``Vision for Transportation.\\'\\' The proposal includes a $1.37 \\nbillion highway bond that would fund 27 highway construction projects \\nand 176 paving projects in 64 counties throughout the state. If \\napproved by the General Assembly, the bond proposal will be placed on \\nthe ballot in November. Massachusetts: Gov. Charlie Baker signed a $200 \\nmillion road bond bill in April 2015. State transportation officials \\nproposed roughly $3 billion in capital transportation projects in \\nfiscal year 2016 for highways, small airports and transit according to \\npress reports. Michigan: The state House of Representatives approved a \\nseries of measures that would generate an extra $555 million in the \\nfiscal 2015-16 budget year and rise to an estimated $1.16 billion when \\nfully phased in during the 2018-19 budget year. The measures include a \\nhike of 4 cents a gallon in the state diesel fuel tax, indexing all \\nmotor fuel taxes to inflation starting in 2016 and revenue diversion \\nfrom the state\\'s general fund by dedicating portions of state income \\nand sales taxes to transportation. A final road funding plan still \\nawaits Senate action. New Mexico: Gov. Susana Martinez signed a $294 \\nmillion infrastructure construction bill largely paid for with bonds \\nand cash reserves. The measure includes more than $70 million for \\nhighways and $45 million for major critical road projects according to \\nlocal press reports.\\n\\nSources: ARTBA\\'s Transportation Investment Advocacy Center; AASHTO \\nDaily Transportation Update; T4America\\'s survey ``State Legislation to \\nRaise Additional Transportation Revenue;\\'\\' NCSL State Bill Database.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n                    PeopleForBikes Business Network\\n\\nP.O.

Bicycling contributes significantly to the national, state and \\nlocal economics. PeopleForBikes Business Network has 1,825 business \\nmembers who depend on very modest federal investments in bike \\ninfrastructure to grow their businesses.\\n\\nBicycling directly generates $81 billion annually for the United States \\neconomy--a figure that includes more than $10 billion in state and \\nlocal tax revenues. More than 750,000 U.S. jobs are supported by the \\nbicycling industry. Across Utah, there are 235 bicycle retailers, \\nemploying 1,215 people, with $198.9 million in annual sales. In Oregon, \\nthere are 282 bicycle retailers, employing 1,493 people, generating \\n$121.6 million in annual sales.\\n\\nBicycling means business--and this business depends on a transportation \\nsystem that not only provides safe places to bike but also the \\nefficient shipment of our product to market. For these reasons, the \\nU.S. bicycle industry supports a well-funded federal transportation \\nprogram not only because it improves bicycle infrastructure, but also \\nbecause the shipping of our products from factory to warehouse to \\nretail point of sale depends on a well-maintained and connected \\ntransportation system. Close to 18 million bikes are sold in the U.S. \\nevery year.\\n\\nCommunities across the country are realizing the economic development \\npotential that comes from an integrated transportation system, where \\nbicycle infrastructure is just one part of their larger system to \\nefficiently move goods to market and reduce congestion during the \\nmorning and evening commute. For example, Indianapolis cites the \\nconstruction of the eight-mile Cultural Trail with attracting at least \\n$100 million in new investment in the city. Continued federal \\ninvestment in bicycle infrastructure is essential to helping more \\ncommunities capitalize of bicycling to meet their transportation \\nchallenges.\\n\\nCommuting by bicycle has doubled since 2000, and a new study shows that \\none in four Americans rode a bicycle last year or 103 million people. \\nAlso, half the trips Americans take are 4 miles or less. We are seeing \\na growth in Americans who look to the bicycle for these short trips. \\nFor example, a trip to the grocery store that is a few miles from their \\nhouse to pick up a few items. As more of these trips are taken by bike, \\nroad congestion, air pollution and parking infrastructure needs are all \\nreduced. This saves our nation money.\\n\\nFinding a long-term funding solution to the Highway Trust Fund is \\ncritical to states and communities across the country to meet the needs \\nof their transportation system, including the construction of good \\nbicycle infrastructure. Without the certainty of a long-term funding \\nsolution many states and communities will hold back on investing in \\nprojects due to the lack of certainty that they will receive a \\nreimbursement from the federal government for transportation projects \\nthat have a multiyear construction timeline.\\n\\nWe look forward to working with the Committee to find a long-term \\nfunding solution to the Highway Trust Fund that recognizes our \\nintegrated transportation system.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n                        Statement for the Record\\n\\n            Hearing: Dead End, No Turn Around, Danger Ahead:\\n\\n              Challenges to the Future of Highway Funding\\n\\n                          Committee on Finance\\n\\n                          United States Senate\\n\\n                             June 18, 2015\\n\\nSubmitted by:   The Real Estate Roundtable\\n               801 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Suite 720\\n               Washington, DC 20004\\n\\n               On behalf of the following organizations:\\n\\n               Alternative and Direct Investment Securities Association\\n               American Hotel and Lodging Association\\n               American Resort Development Association\\n               American Society of Interior Designers\\n               Building Owners and Managers Association International\\n               CCIM Institute\\n               Institute of Real Estate Management\\n               International Council of Shopping Centers\\n               International Union of Painters and Allied Trades\\n               Investment Program Association\\n               NAIOP, Commercial Real Estate Development Association\\n               National Apartment Association\\n               National Association of REALTORS<SUP>\\'</SUP>\\n               National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts\\n               National Multifamily Housing Council\\n               The Real Estate Roundtable\\n\\n    As the Senate Committee on Finance meets to consider the \\nfeasibility of various ideas to provide a sustainable, long-term \\nsolution to the shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund, the undersigned \\norganizations urge the Committee to consider a simple, cost-effective \\nproposal that would galvanize billions in new private capital for \\ninvestment in U.S. transportation and infrastructure. Specifically, any \\nlong-term highway bill should include reforms to the Foreign Investment \\nin Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA), such as those proposed in \\nthe Real Estate Investment and Jobs Act of 2015 (S. 915/H.R. 2128).\\n\\n    FIRPTA is a major obstacle to mobilizing private sector capital for \\ninfrastructure projects. The punitive FIRPTA law subjects foreign \\ninvestment in U.S. real estate or infrastructure to a much higher tax \\nburden than applies to a foreign investor purchasing a U.S. stock or \\nbond, or an investment in any other asset class. FIRPTA imposes U.S. \\ntax on gain realized by a foreign investor on the disposition of an \\n``interest\\'\\' in U.S. real property, which includes infrastructure \\nassets. In some cases, FIRPTA can generate a tax burden as high as 54.5 \\npercent. The FIRPTA regime is an anti-competitive outlier that deters \\nand deflects capital to other markets. FIRPTA reform would serve as a \\nstrong, market-driven catalyst for the financing of much-needed \\ninfrastructure improvements, including upgrades to our transportation \\nsystem.\\n\\n    Meeting our infrastructure needs will require a combination of \\npublic and private investment, and passive foreign investors could play \\na significant role in financing public-private partnerships involving: \\nports, bridges, airports, tunnels, toll roads, light rail, freight \\nrail, and other income-producing infrastructure assets. Pooled and \\nsyndicated capital is already being deployed in infrastructure projects \\nthrough infrastructure funds organized as partnerships. REITs are \\nanother model that has been used with some success for infrastructure \\ninvestment.\\\\1\\\\ Nonetheless, the United States is far behind other \\nregions of the world in harnessing private investment for \\ninfrastructure development.\\\\2\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Deloitte, REITs and Infrastructure Projects (2010), available \\nat: http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/mx/Documents/bienes-\\nraices/REITs_infrastructure_proyects.pdf.\\n    \\\\2\\\\ OECD, Pension Funds Investment in Infrastructure: A Survey \\n(2011), available at: http://www.oecd.org/sti/futures/\\ninfrastructureto2030/48634596.pdf.\\n\\n    Foreign institutional investors--pension funds, life insurance \\ncompanies, etc.--are ideal partners for U.S. infrastructure projects \\nbecause they have the capital needed for large-scale projects and the \\ntime horizon necessary for the long-term returns associated with the \\nupfront investment. Infrastructure investments are attractive to \\nforeign institutional investors because they offer: stable and \\npredictable income streams that exceed fixed income markets, \\ndiversification benefits, and a hedge against inflation. Because the \\npublic-private infrastructure model is more developed in other \\ncountries, foreign institutional investors are often more comfortable \\nand experienced investing in infrastructure assets than are their U.S. \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ncounterparts.\\n\\n    FIRPTA is a major hurdle for the foreign investor seeking to invest \\nin U.S. infrastructure projects. Under current law, FIRPTA applies when \\nat least 50 percent of a company\\'s balance sheet is attributable to the \\nvalue of real property. In 2008, the IRS issued an announcement in \\nwhich it indicated that many of the governmental licenses and permits \\nbeing issued in connection with the leasing of transportation assets, \\nsuch as toll bridges, should be treated as inseparable from the \\nunderlying real property, and thus as U.S. real property interests \\nsubject to FIRPTA.\\\\3\\\\ In 2014, the IRS issued proposed regulations in \\nthe REIT area confirming that, among other things, certain inherently \\npermanent structures such as microwave transmission, cell, broadcast, \\nand electrical transmission towers; bridges; tunnels; roadbeds; and \\nrailroad tracks are real property for REIT purposes.\\\\4\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ Internal Revenue Service, Announcement 2008-115 (December 1, \\n2008), available at: http://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-48_IRB/ar18.html.\\n    \\\\4\\\\ Treas.

In a 2013 report, one of the big four \\naccounting firms noted how FIRPTA obstructs infrastructure investment \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nin the United States:\\n\\n        The FIRPTA rules may be of significant relevance to non-U.S. \\n        persons investing in infrastructure projects because such \\n        investments often provide investors various rights in the \\n        underlying infrastructure asset. As a result of these interests \\n        or rights in the asset, a further issue is raised as to whether \\n        the investor has obtained beneficial ownership of real property \\n        rights to which the FIRPTA rules could apply.\\\\5\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\5\\\\ PWC, Infrastructure Investing: Global Trends and Tax \\nConsiderations, Part 2 (2013), available at: http://www.pwc.com/us/en/\\ncapital-projects-infrastructure/publications/assets/infrastructure-\\ninvesting-part2.pdf.\\n\\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation has also acknowledged the effect of \\nFIRPTA on foreign investors in U.S. infrastructure, ``the special U.S. \\ntax rules applicable to foreign investment in U.S. real estate . . . \\nmay affect the U.S. tax treatment of foreign [infrastructure] \\ninvestors.

According to Christopher Lee, founder and \\nmanaging partner of Highstar Capital, an infrastructure investment \\nfirm, ``[t]here are many billions of dollars in overseas capital \\nsitting on the sidelines because those investors are wary of the burden \\nFIRPTA will have on their investments.\\'\\' \\\\7\\\\ Highstar Capital has \\ninvested more than $7.8 billion in infrastructure since its inception.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\7\\\\ See Christopher Lee, Let\\'s at Least Have a Sensible Tax \\nStructure When It Comes to Infrastructure, The Huffington Post, \\navailable at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-h-lee/lets-at-\\nleast-have-a-sens_b_3112325.html.\\n\\n    Because of the close connection between FIRPTA and infrastructure \\ninvestment, the Administration has included a FIRPTA reform proposal in \\nits Rebuild America infrastructure initiative and its last three budget \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nsubmissions.\\n\\n    Moreover, transportation improvements, infrastructure build-outs, \\nand thousands of new jobs would flow from the commercial real estate \\ninvestment generated by FIRPTA reform. Real estate development and \\ninfrastructure upgrades are inextricably linked. For example, in just \\nthe last month, a prominent property owner in the Northeast agreed to \\ninvest $220 million in improvements to Grand Central Station, one of \\nthe country\\'s most important transit hubs, as part of a larger \\ncommercial real estate project in New York.\\\\8\\\\ Similar examples, on a \\nsmaller scale, can be found throughout the country.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\8\\\\ Associated Press, NYC approves skyscraper in exchange for \\ntransit hub work (May 27, 2015), available at: http://\\nfinance.yahoo.com/news/nyc-approves-skyscraper-exchange-transit-\\n201204047.html.\\n\\n    Last year, the Urban Land Institute (ULI) released its annual \\nreport on infrastructure trends and issues.\\\\9\\\\ According to ULI\\'s \\nsurvey of 250 public sector leaders in local/regional government and \\nover 200 senior-level private developers, the most promising source of \\ninfrastructure funding over the next decade will be joint development \\nor cooperation between local governments and developers. Also high on \\nthe list was ``negotiated exactions,\\'\\' which refers to tying \\ndevelopment rights to infrastructure improvements.

Real estate projects finance \\ntransportation and other improvements through mandatory state and local \\nimpact fees. A 2012 study found that nationally, for a typical multi-\\nfamily development, impact fees in excess of 6.7 percent of the \\nproject\\'s value will be paid to the local government to finance the \\ncommunity\\'s surrounding infrastructure.\\\\11\\\\ The same study found that \\nthe average developer of a 100,000 square foot retail shopping center \\nin the United States will pay a local government $568,500 to improve \\nnearby roads, $244,000 to improve the water and sewer system, and \\n$83,700 to build up surrounding parks.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\11\\\\ Duncan Associates, 2012 National Impact Fee Survey (2012), \\navailable at: http://www.impactfees.com/publications%20pdf/\\n2012_survey.pdf.\\n\\n    The most recent FIRPTA reform proposal, the Real Estate Investment \\nand Jobs Act of 2015 (H.R. 2128), introduced by Representatives Kevin \\nBrady (R-TX) and Joseph Crowley (D-NY), includes two critical \\nprovisions to mobilize foreign capital for real estate and \\ninfrastructure investment in the United States. First, it would \\nincrease the ownership stake that a foreign investor can take in a \\npublicly traded U.S. real estate investment trust without triggering \\nFIRPTA liability and extend the provision to certain collective \\ninvestment vehicles. Second, it would remove the tax penalty that \\nFIRPTA imposes on foreign pension funds that invest in U.S. real estate \\nand infrastructure. Together, these two bipartisan and noncontroversial \\nchanges would unlock billions of foreign capital for job-creating \\ninvestment here at home. In less than 2 months, H.R. 2128 has already \\nattracted the co-sponsorship of 31 of the 39 members of the Ways and \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMeans Committee.\\n\\n    The Brady-Crowley bill is nearly identical to an amendment filed by \\nSenators Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Michael Enzi (R-WY) when the Senate \\nFinance Committee considered Highway Trust Fund legislation last year. \\nFor several years, Senators Menendez and Enzi have led the effort in \\nthe Senate to unlock foreign capital for investment in U.S. commercial \\nreal estate.\\n\\n    In February, under the leadership of Senators Menendez and Enzi, as \\nwell as Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-\\nOR), the Senate Finance Committee unanimously passed another version of \\nFIRPTA reform \\n(S. 915), which increases the cap on foreign ownership of U.S. publicly \\ntraded REITs. The full House passed a similar bill in 2010 by a vote of \\n402-11.\\n\\n    Over the long run, by mobilizing capital and increasing investment, \\n\\nFIRPTA reform will have a positive impact on the economy, job growth, \\nand tax revenue. However, any short-term effect on the Federal budget, \\nas estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, can be fully offset \\nwith noncontroversial, related revenue provisions. At the time of mark-\\nup, S. 915 was financed with provisions aimed at improving tax \\ncompliance.\\n\\n    Congress should reform outdated tax regimes such as FIRPTA and pave \\nthe way for market-based, privately financed infrastructure investment. \\nThank you for the Committee\\'s consideration of our submission.

My name is Roy Littlefield, and I serve as the \\nExecutive Vice President of the Tire Industry Association (TIA), TIA is \\na national trade association representing close to 8,000 small business \\nmembers (who operate over 20,000 small business retail outlets), \\nengaged in the retail, retreading, importing, and distributing of all \\nvarieties of tires. TIA members have been involved in the collection of \\nFederal tire excise taxes since 1918. Our industry is dependent on a \\nsound highway system.\\n\\n    TIA supports a long-term Federal Aid Highway bill. It is time for \\nCongress to look beyond short-term patchwork funding proposals. If \\nCongress tries to continue funding at current levels, it will have to \\nchoose among several unsavory options. While we support a long-term \\nbill, we are opposed to many proposals being circulated.\\n\\n    The Federal Excise Tax on tires was first levied in 1918 mainly \\nbecause of revenue needs brought about by World War I. The Revenue Act \\nof 1918 imposed a tax on both tires and tubes at the rate of 5% of the \\nretail price.\\n\\n    The tax was reduced after the war, and then later repealed in 1926.\\n\\n    The levy was reintroduced during the Great Depression, and was \\nincreased in 1941 to help finance World War II.\\n\\n    In 1956, the rate of the tax was raised in response to legislation \\nenacted to build the interstate highway system and to create the \\nHighway Trust Fund.\\n\\n    The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 provided for a significant \\nexpansion of the federal-aid highway program and authorized federal \\nfunding over a longer period of time so as to permit long-range \\nplanning. It was considered necessary to authorize the entire \\nInterstate Highway program to assure orderly planning and completion of \\nthis network of highways throughout the United States as efficiently \\nand as economically as possible. In the case of tire taxes, the act \\nraised certain rates and expanded the rate structure by prescribing \\ndifferent rates for different tire types. Tires for highway vehicles \\nwere taxed at 8 cents per pound, other tires at 5 cents per pound, \\ninner tubes at 9 cents per pound, and tread rubber at 3 cents per \\npound. Later, of course, that was raised to 5 cents per pound.\\n\\n    In an effort to stimulate job creation, the Congress passed the \\nSurface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982. The tire tax was \\nactually hammered out late on a Friday night during a conference \\ncommittee session.\\n\\n    One of its goals (besides increased revenues for construction and \\nmaintenance of the Nation\\'s highways) was a redistribution of highway \\ncosts between car and truck users. Accordingly, the act changed several \\nof the excise taxes that fund the Highway Trust Fund. For example, the \\nexcise taxes on tread rubber and inner tubes were repealed as were the \\ntaxes on non-highway and laminated tires. A new tax structure for heavy \\ntires with graduated excise tax rates dependent on tire weight was \\nestablished. Tires which weigh less than 40 pounds were exempted from \\nthe excise tax so that tires for most passenger cars are no longer \\ntaxable. The excise tax rates on heavy tires ranged from 15 to 90 cents \\na pound according to the weight of the tire. These rates are shown in \\nthe following table.\\n\\n  Excise Tax Rates on Tires Under the Surface Transportation Assistance\\n                               Act of 1982\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n           Weight of Tire                             Tax\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n0-40 lbs.

Will Congress pass another short-term bill, or will they \\nfund the infrastructure at a level deemed necessary to sustain the \\nsystem for the foreseeable future? Let\\'s look at the range of some of \\nthe options being considered.\\nOption #1\\n    Significantly raise the fuel tax. This would be the easiest option \\nto administer, and would be supported by environmentalists. It would be \\nopposed by most in the auto and truck industries.\\n\\n    This option would not require any changes to nonfuel taxes.\\nOption #2\\n    Moderately raise the fuel tax, reinstate the FET on passenger tires \\nand retread rubber (5 cents a pound).\\nOption #3\\n    Raise the fuel tax by a lesser amount, reinstate FET on passenger \\ntires and retread rubber (5-15 cents a pound), and increase existing \\nnonfuel taxes by 10% including heavy tires).\\nOption #4\\n\\n    Consider:\\n\\n                (1) Increased tolling\\n                (2) Congestion fees\\n                (3) Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) charges\\n                (4) National Weight-Distance Tax on Truckers\\n                (5) Increase private sector investment (i.e. \\n                privatization of highways)\\n                (6) National Infrastructure Bank\\n                (7) Sales tax on oil producers at the wholesale level\\n\\n    Today, revenues from the excise tax on tires provide less than 2% \\nof the Highway Trust Fund receipts.\\n\\n    We are taking two strong positions:\\n\\n  1.  Eliminate diversion. We are approaching 30% of the funds \\n        collected for the Highway Trust Fund diverted for non-highway \\n        purposes.\\n  2.  Engage creatively in future highway funding. We were an early \\n        supporter of legislation introduced by Congressman John Delany \\n        (D-MD) ``The Partnership to Build America Act\\'\\' (H.R. 2084).\\n\\n    The Partnership to Build America Act is a bipartisan effort to find \\nnew funding for roads, bridges, and transit. The Act finances $750 \\nbillion in infrastructure investment using no appropriated funds and \\nhas 50 co-sponsors (25 Republicans and 25 Democrats). On January 17, \\n2014, two Senators--a Republican and a Democrat, introduced a companion \\nbill. Within a week, five Republican Senators and three Democratic \\nSenators came out in support of the bill.\\n\\n    The bill is an attempt to address two problems: how to fund \\ntransportation and how to entice U.S. corporations, which have stashed \\nan estimated $1.45 trillion abroad, to bring that money home. Delaney\\'s \\nplan would create a $50 billion Federal fund to bankroll loans and \\nleverage private investment for transportation and other \\ninfrastructure. The money would come from bonds bought by companies who \\nwant a tax break if they bring cash earned abroad back to the U.S.\\n\\n    TIA\\'s position is very clear: eliminate diversion, oppose tax \\nincreases, engage in creative funding and tax reform, address our \\ninfrastructure crisis and pass a long-term infrastructure finding bill. \\nTIA, along with the highway, transit, trucking, and motorist \\ncommunities, is committed to supporting your efforts.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n\\n                      Transportation Equity Caucus\\n\\n                    Statement for the Hearing Record\\n\\n                             Submitted to:\\n\\n                        Senate Finance Committee\\n\\n                             June 18, 2015\\n\\n                              Hearing on:\\n\\n               ``Dead End, No Turn Around, Danger Ahead: \\n             Challenges to the Future of Highway Funding\\'\\'\\n\\nChair Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, and members of the Committee:\\n\\nAs members of the Transportation Equity Caucus, a diverse coalition of \\norganizations promoting policies that ensure access, mobility, and \\nopportunity for all, we appreciate the opportunity to submit this \\nstatement for the record today to express our priorities for the \\nfinancing of the Highway Trust Fund.\\n\\nThe Transportation Equity Caucus is a group of more than 100 \\norganizations formed by the nation\\'s leading civil rights, community \\ndevelopment, social justice, economic justice, faith-based, health, \\nhousing, disability, labor, tribal, women\\'s groups and transportation \\norganizations. Our goal is to drive transportation policies that \\nadvance economic and social equity in America.\\n\\nTransportation is a critical link to opportunity-connecting us to jobs, \\nschools, housing, health care, and grocery stores. We are pleased that \\nthe Senate Finance Committee (Committee) recognizes the importance of \\ncreating a long-term plan for the financing of the Highway Trust Fund. \\nIn addition, we look forward to working with Congressional Leaders to \\ndevelop and pass transportation legislation driven by the following \\nprinciples of economic and social equity:\\n\\n  <bullet>  Create affordable transportation options for all people.\\n  <bullet>  Ensure fair access to quality jobs, workforce development, \\n        and contracting opportunities in the transportation industry.\\n  <bullet>  Promote healthy, safe, and inclusive communities.\\n  <bullet>  Invest equitably and focus on results.\\n\\nFailing to provide the long-term, sustained investment in \\ntransportation infrastructure keeps workers out of jobs, undercuts \\nlong-term planning, and hinders the nation\\'s ability to advance to a \\ntransportation system that provides for the needs of all its users. \\nSustained transportation investment is crucial to developing equitable \\ncommunities, expanding employment opportunities, and boosting our \\nnation\\'s economic recovery.\\n\\nAs a recent New York Times article highlighted,\\\\1\\\\ a lack of reliable \\nand efficient transportation is often an almost insurmountable barrier \\nfor low-income people trying to access jobs and build better lives for \\nthemselves and their children. Three-fourths of low-and middle-skill \\njobs cannot be accessed by a one-way 90-minute transit commute.\\\\2\\\\ \\nAlso, in a national, long-term study,\\\\3\\\\ researchers at Harvard found \\ncommute times were a crucial predictor of upward social mobility: \\nfamilies living in areas with shorter average commute times had a \\nbetter chance of moving up the economic ladder than those living in \\nareas with longer average commute times.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Bouchard, Mikayla. ``Transportation Emerges as Crucial to \\nEscaping Poverty.\\'\\' \\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/upshot/transportation-emerges-as-\\ncrucial-to-escaping-poverty.html?abt=0002&abg=1&_r=1.\\n    \\\\2\\\\ Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2008; National Household \\nTravel Survey, 2009; U.S. Department of Treasury, Community Development \\nFinancial Institutions Fund, 2001; and Brookings Institution, 2011.\\n    \\\\3\\\\ Chetty, R., N.

Web.\\n    http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hendren/files/mobility_geo.pdf.\\n\\nMoreover, low-income households are struggling with significant \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ntransportation costs:\\n\\n  <bullet>  Low- and moderate-income households spend 42 percent of \\n        their total annual income on transportation, compared to \\n        middle-income households, who spend less than 22 percent.\\n\\n  <bullet>  According to the U.S. Department of Treasury, \\n        transportation expenses for households in the bottom 90 percent \\n        income bracket are twice that of those in the top 10 percent \\n        income bracket.\\n\\nAdditionally, many communities of color and low income populations face \\nbarriers to accessing reliable transportation. Over 22 percent of \\nAfrican Americans, 14 percent of Latino households and 45 percent of \\nU.S. rental households with mobility device users have no personal \\nvehicle,\\\\4\\\\ and 15 percent of Native Americans must travel more than \\n100 miles to access basic services.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\4\\\\ The University of Kansas Research and Training Center on \\nIndependent Living, http://www.rtcil.org/\\x08rtcil/cl/documents/\\nUS%20Housing%20urban&rural%20tagged%20logo.pdf.\\n\\nAdequate Federal transportation investments can lay a strong foundation \\nfor economic growth and expand opportunity for millions of people. \\nStrategic Federal investments in transportation can transform \\nstruggling communities, unleash untapped human potential, and promote \\nlocal economic development to allow all people to thrive. When \\ntransportation funding decisions are driven by economic and social \\nequity, we can build transportation system that works for everyone, \\nregardless of income, race or zip code. To this end, we ask the \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCommittee to:\\n\\n    1.  Utilize new revenue to expand or improve mobility and access \\n            for underserved communities.\\n    2.  Ensure that any mechanisms used to finance our nation\\'s \\n            transportation system (whether that be repatriation, \\n            increasing the gas tax, user fees, or other potential \\n            financing mechanisms) do not disproportionately burden low-\\n            income people.\\n    3.  Work with the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee \\n            to establish criteria and align federal funding to national \\n            transportation outcomes such as improved mobility for \\n            people and goods, access, transit ridership, health and \\n            safety, as well as reduced household costs, carbon \\n            emissions, and vehicle miles traveled.\\n\\nThe Transportation Equity Caucus stands ready to work with this \\ncommittee on these outcomes.
