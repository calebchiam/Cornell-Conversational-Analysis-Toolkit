Don't worry, there are like 20 other mods besides the ones you seem to have a problem with and (gasp!) a lot of the mods are liberal. So pretty much everyone stays in check and we too have had the admins ban mods who have been caught misbehaving. That's the funny thing about actual evidence, when you have some people act on it versus what you guys do which is make accusations without credible evidence. If you had evidence the mods would quickly and easily ban people for vote manipulation.\\n  \\nIt's really obvious to me that you are way too involved in this gun stuff. That's cool. I mean, this is reddit after all and everyone can be interested in whatever they want. You seem to have taken your devotion to a whole other level which has led you to believe things that are untrue. \\n  \\nI don't know how things work in this little tiny subreddit, but with a subreddit as large as /r/Politics its pretty dense of you to believe that the mods there have must time to do anything other than clean the spam queue and answer mod mails. For this reason, it's more important for us to have mods that can handle these basic things and have time to commit to these tasks. It's less important for us to have mods from every single issue related subreddit ever. I mean, it's painfully obvious to me that if we have to add one mod per issue then we will have a lot of crazy fucking mods running around. \\n  \\nLook, I'm not a racist and I don't hate black people but that doesn't mean I'm using my mod position to push a pro-African American agenda and it certainly doesn't mean we need to pick up someone from r/Niggers to counter me in this regard. If it makes you feel better I'm not a big supporter of gun rights and all that (although I live in the south and realize how guns are going no where any time soon). So you see, you actually already have what you want but I'm sure you'll find some dumb way to yell at me as if getting EXACTLY what you want EXACTLY when you want doesn't make you look like some some spoiled chick on her 16th birthday. \\n\\nI'm out of here.
